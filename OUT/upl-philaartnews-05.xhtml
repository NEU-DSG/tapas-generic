                              of Art in Philadelphia. Our methods for collecting the news are being steadily perfected.
                              The paper grows in vitality.

                              Part of our approach to that standard has been definitely mapped. Each step along
                              the way means more comprehensive integration in a news picture of the ties connecting
                              all branches of the plastic and graphic arts.

                        <p id="d73373e234">Another example of nineteenth century French painting has been acquired by the Wilstach
                           Collection, “The Ballet Class,” by Edgar Degas, one of the most distinguished draftsmen
                           of the century. In announcing this purchase, the Park Commission said, “This important
                           example of Degas’ painting was among the pictures purchased direct from the artist
                           by Mary Cassatt, painter and friend of Degas, for her brother, Alexander J. Cassatt.”

                        <p id="d73373e237">“The Ballet Class,” which was painted about 1880, is considered by the Museum to be
                           one of Degas’ finest expressions. Its choice by Mary Cassatt, a Philadelphian and
                           a distinguished Impressionist painter in her own right, shows her to have been a sensitive
                           observer and a connoisseur of the art of her own time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e241">Philadelphians will remember “The Ballet Class” from the exhibition of Impressionist
                           Figure Painters here in 1934, and the Museum’s Degas Exhibition held last year. After
                           the latter showing it was returned to Paris to be included in the Degas Exhibition
                           organized by the French Government.

                           it will hang with other paintings lent from the main body of the Wilstach Collection,
                           housed in Memorial Hall. Included in this collection are several other paintings obtained
                           from the Cassatt family some years ago.

                        <p id="d73373e277">“To the discriminating, it speaks volumes that the new Post Office is artistically
                           of more value than the Art Museum.” And with this blow to Philadelphia’s artistic
                           complacency, Dr. Leopold Stokowski launched into a stimulating discussion of art and
                           art appreciation in the world today, more particularly in this city.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e280">Following up his initial rhetorical question concerning the artistic merits of the
                           Museum building, Stokowski gave his reasons for preferring the Post Office. The Post
                           Office is light, effective, and American in its conception; the Museum is quasi-Greek
                           with hundreds of tiny windows, whereas “the light should come from above, and then
                           one might be able to see the pictures.”

                        <p id="d73373e289">Mention of the Greek model for the Museum, rather than a design based on function,
                           caused Stokowski to remember with amusement the Greek inscriptions on the outer walls.
                           Why could they not have used English instead, English texts that would have said something
                           to the average man? His feeling toward the whole matter of the Museum’s impracticality
                           and hence lack of artistic value was illustrated when he pointed to the ceiling of
                           the Pullman car where the conversation was taking place and said, “Look at that false
                           ceiling. Metal painted in panels to look like wood. Why?”
                        </p>

                        <p id="d73373e295">Stokowski made no dogmatic reply to this question, but instead explained his own position,
                           which has been formed through his experience as a musician. “In music we know that
                           every ear is constructed differently. No two people hear music the same way. I feel
                           that Bach was a great musician, but I have no way of proving it. It is all a matter
                           of personal reaction. Is it not the same in painting? Probably no two eyes see color
                           or form in the same way.” He pointed to the Pullman chair. “If I were to say that
                           this pattern is good and beautiful, would you believe me because you feel that I have
                           good taste? Painting and music are intended for the enjoyment of people. Why all this
                           discussion about Cézanne? Who is to say what is a good picture or a bad one?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e298">“Do you feel that one day art will attain the same widespread popularity that good
                           music now enjoys, in this city, largely through your efforts?”

                        <p id="d73373e301">“I feel that television will increase the public appreciation of the graphic arts.
                           It will be possible to bring visual art in the form of good composition, color, form,
                           to the homes of us all, even as radio has brought good music, and unfortunately, much
                           trash, to the attention of every man, woman, and child in the United States.”

                        <p id="d73373e304">Pursuing our private grievance we asked Stokowski if there existed in music the same
                           condition that prevailed in the art world, namely that our local artists have to gain
                           their reputation in New York before they are accepted here.

                        <p id="d73373e330">We know a number of devotees of art—both professionals and laymen—who just simply
                           don’t like prints. Of these two sections of the Society for Suppression of Prints,
                           the artist-members give us the greater variety of reasons for their distaste. Some
                           object to the fact that prints can be duplicated, others because prints are not sufficiently
                           even in the process of duplication. There are those who contend that prints are not
                           originals, and that artists should produce only “original” work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e333">The technical restrictions of a print bring ominous objections from another portion
                           of our artistry, while again we have encountered gigantic contempt: that the print
                           medium is one for the “illustrator” or “dilettante.” With artists, however, the most
                           popular point of distaste seems to arise from the print’s great dependence upon halftone.
                           (We are not, incidentally, speaking of Japanese prints.)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e337">The laymen who do not like prints say very simply, for the most part, that such things
                           are merely holes burnt in paper.

                        <p id="d73373e343">While some of these objections are to a certain—and extremely mild!—extent true, there
                           is, however, a greater truth that none of the Members seem to have mentioned: that
                           a work of art remains a work of art whether etched on copper, drawn upon stone, painted
                           with coffee or carved in soap. The durability of the last two media is somewhat dubious,
                           but its discussion is beyond the scope of this article.

                        <p id="d73373e346">We believe that many Members of the Society would be inclined to toss their membership
                           cards in the nearest wastebasket were they to undertake a broader vision concerning
                           the print as art.

                        <p id="d73373e349">The resources of the symphony orchestra, or of opera, are infinite, technically. Upon
                           the huge symphonic or operatic canvas the composer has carte blanche. He is fleetingly
                           iridescent, with no tonal terra firma, as was Debussy with “Pelleas and Mellisande”;
                           should he be more hot-blooded, he writhes upon Wagner’s bed of tonal passion with
                           “Tristan and Isolde”; or creates the monumental classic-dramatic temples of a Beethoven
                           or Brahms (if he can); likewise, the delicacy of Mozart or simplemindedness of Haydn
                           have filled many a symphonic canvas amply. For what is orchestral composition but
                           an oil that we see with our ears?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e352">Now we’ll turn to Chopin and Liszt as exemplars of the purely pianistic in piano music.
                           Regardless of how “orchestral” some of their compositions might have been or how actively
                           we had responded to symphonic or operatic music, it would never occur to us to listen
                           to the piano works of either composer expecting to hear sounds similar to strings,
                           woodwinds or brass. We do not expect an orchestra when we attend a piano recital,
                           or, for that matter, a recital of songs or of any solo instrument. Which is as it
                           should be, for is not solo composition a print which we see with our ears?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e356">The more universal this concept becomes, the wider will we find general sympathy for
                           prints.

                        <p id="d73373e359">Also, it may lead the more thoughtful of our number into fruitful critical bypaths.
                           Having established the bond connecting the powerful and technically weighty piano
                           works of Beethoven and Brahms with their respective orchestral compositions, they
                           will have little difficulty sighting the broad highway from Etching to Painting traversed
                           by Rembrandt and Goya. They will find the inventiveness of Picasso’s oils reflected
                           in his prints, the decoratively orchestral Matisse doing solo work in his lithographs,
                           and Whistler freeing himself more through halftone than color.

                        <p id="d73373e362">Also, they’ll learn that many print-makers are not painters in spirit, as Chopin was
                           not an orchestral composer, and this will induce the added delight of discovering
                           the sometimes obscure, sometimes conspicuous technical and spiritual differences that
                           exist in such cases.

                        <p id="d73373e365">In a word, they’ll look upon prints AS prints.</p>

                        <p id="d73373e376">Speaking of solos, the lithographs of Yasuo Kuniyoshi, now being shown at the Carlen
                           Galleries, are little short of gems. Kuniyoshi is one of the few painters who have
                           acquired an almost equal amount of fame in the direction of print-making, and there
                           is a most conspicuous connection, in this case, between the two.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e380">Having devised a highly individual technical idiom, this painter print-maker has turned
                           it to as effective graphic, as well as pigmental, account. Kuniyoshi’s treatment of
                           line and mass is quite as personal as his handwriting, whether it be on canvas or
                           stone, and in these black-and-whites there is evident an exquisite tonal sense and
                           unusual suggestion of “color”. His penchant for sweeping lines plus continual use
                           of the vignette principle create a combination that is unique.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e383">Hand in hand with purely technical problems, the artist has developed a characteristic
                           and conscious figure distortion, notable in such prints as “Girl with Cigarette,”
                           “Three Dancers” and “Wire Walker.” Rarely have we seen light handled so expertly as
                           in “Before the Act,” while “Girl with Feathered Hat” indicates how nearly this artist
                           can come to the primitives and retain his individuality.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e386">Of the landscapes, “The Storm” is the most remarkable, and one of the most expressive
                           black-and-whites we have seen. “Dress Form” gives us a strange graphic experience,
                           achieving surrealistic effect without the slightest suggestion of surrealism in treatment
                           of subject or style.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e389">Only a mind and hand with Oriental decorative sense could accomplish the draughtsmanship
                           of animals such as we find in “Back Yards” or “Bull Fight.” In the latter the horse
                           bears infinitely more resemblance to an Oriental dragon. The still life “Grape and
                           Sculpture Mold” is thoroughly delightful in its inventiveness.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e392">It is refreshing to see Maurice Molarsky turning from portraiture to seascape and
                           still life, as evidenced by his present showing of oils at the Art Alliance. This
                           may or may not be a recent tendency—however, it is a highly commendable one.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e395">Molarsky’s technical mastery is undeniable. He seems always to place upon canvas exactly
                           what he intends, and when concentrating upon trees, mountains and the sea, the result
                           is not only convincing as his portraiture, but infinitely more eloquent.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e399">In “Beach at Highpoint,” “Hull’s Cove” and “Woods on Island,” the blue sings in the
                           water, but it is still fairly the Molarsky of the portrait. A distinctly different
                           artist is visible in “The On-Coming Fog,” in which the painter’s characteristic finish
                           is sacrificed to a more dramatic ruggedness of treatment, and retains, in consequence,
                           more aesthetic impact than any of the other canvases.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e402">We should add a possible exception to this: three small and quite exquisite beach
                           studies—not at all Molarsky the portraitist and very much Molarsky the painter. “Thursday
                           Afternoon” (a negro seated in the park), is labeled “unfinished,” and really should
                           remain so. More paint would ruin it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e405">Among the portraits, “Master Jackie Geary” is technically the most informal no less
                           than the best. The others seem to add data to our theory that great portraiture died
                           with Thomas Raeburn.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e408">The Art Alliance, energetic organization that it is, does not stop here. Two of the
                           second floor galleries are hung with caricatures—contemporary except for Daumier and
                           Forain.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e411">We freely admit that the inclusion of these two giants almost ruined the show for
                           us. As cartoons we have spiritually much more in common with the works of today, but
                           we can’t say as much for the art in many of them. Some come miraculously near to the
                           goal, but escape by a hair. At any rate, Daumier and Forain were there, and, for the
                           sake of our contemporaries, we ignored them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e414">Then we found ourselves liking the delicate irony of Shermund and the free, bold brush
                           caricature of Emidio Angelo, that merry soul. Likewise, we culled much amusement from
                           the work of John Held, Jr., Ray Rohn and Rea Irwin, more preoccupied with decoration
                           than caricature. We enjoyed Edward C. Smith’s cruel etchings of Earl Horter, Richard
                           Dooner and Stokowski. A. Alain’s phantasies of light and heavy lines were as witty
                           as usual and the creatures of R. Taylor perfectly grand in their complete lack of
                           a particle of brain matter. Dick Decker’s acute observations in line and wash (probably
                           done at three o’clock in the morning) and H. Devitt Welsh’s curious concoctions on
                           copper complete our list of particularly appealing material.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e418">Continuing our pilgrimage in the Art Alliance, we come to an exhibition of water colors
                           by William S. Schwartz and, to say the least, we are arrested.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e421">“Water colors?” say we; “Rather they are vivid batiks upon paper. Most assuredly they
                           should have been upon silk, but the paper makes them no less emotional—but decorative—batiks.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e424">Batiks or no, they are certainly products of another world—a world we hope Schwartz
                           lives in, and would rather like to inhabit ourselves, provided we could escape when
                           necessary.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e427">It is by all odds a world of vivid color (color that we can imagine one day tiring
                           of)—and a world of forlorn, unhappy, and sometimes tragic forms continually warring
                           with color—a world that quite unnerves us, sometimes fascinates us, sometimes repulses
                           us. Schwartz sees glory in trees that he cannot find in humanity, and we feel very
                           sorry about that. There are some healthy people in this world, but seemingly, not
                           in the world of this artist.

                        <p id="d73373e623">Among the lesser known museums of Philadelphia is that of the Historical Society of
                           Pennsylvania, 1300 Locust Street. Established in 1824 “for the purpose of elucidating
                           the civil, literary, and natural history of Pennsylvania” the Society’s primary intent
                           is to gather objects and documents of historical importance, but as historical and
                           aesthetic values frequently coincide, the collection of American painting, sculpture,
                           and crafts of past centuries has almost equal interest for the antiquarian and the
                           artist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e627">Two of the Society’s most valued oils, Charles Wilson Peale’s “Benjamin Franklin”
                           and “Mrs. John Dickinson” are now on loan at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, but
                           the collection remains rich in other early American portraiture. Among the paintings
                           now on view are the famous “Portrait in armor” of William Penn, Benjamin West’s “George
                           III” and “Queen Charlotte,” a self-portrait by John Meng, an artist born in Germantown
                           in 1704, and the charming Sully portrait of Mrs. George Roberts Smith. Among the works
                           in other media are a quaint anonymous portrait of Ann Lynch McShane, painted on glass
                           c. 1805, and a great number of porcelain miniatures. One of the most unusual paintings
                           is a rough sketch on a wood panel of Lafayette, visiting Independence Hall in 1825,
                           done by Bars Otis.

                        <p id="d73373e630">Early American sculpture is illustrated fully, from the classical marble busts of
                           the Hiram Powers school to the anecdotal Rogers groups. Of the latter class, the “Council
                           of War” showing a conference of Lincoln, Seward, and Stanton, is typical. The Philadelphia
                           sculptor William Rush is represented by an elaborately carved wood “Figure of Music.”

                        <p id="d73373e633">The crafts of Colonial America are exceptionally well exemplified. Many beautiful
                           pieces of furniture of early periods have been preserved, among them a set of dining-room
                           chairs used by Washington during his residence in Philadelphia, and a graceful low-boy
                           made by a Philadelphia cabinetmaker. Several cases are filled with eighteenth and
                           early nineteenth century silver. Work of the early eighteenth century silversmith
                           John Nys is shown in two silver tankards. Ceramics and glass of this early period
                           are also fully represented.

                           exemplified than in the formation of the Philadelphia Display Guild. Composed of men
                           from the display departments of the city’s leading stores and shops, the group resembles
                           other organizations of a professional nature in that the main purpose is to promote
                           their individual enterprises through association with other men in the field.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e698">Display men of Philadelphia recently decided that, as long as their art is for business,
                           they should make it their business to know more about their art—hence the new Guild.
                           The Guild is rapidly expanding, widening its membership among men of the arts and
                           trades connected with fine merchandise display. The importance of this local movement
                           is seen in the fact that it has already affiliated itself with the International Association
                           of Display Men.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e701">Display as a profession is steadily gaining recognition as an important branch of
                           commercial art. To justify this growing confidence, in what used to be an after-thought
                           of advertising, the members of the Philadelphia Display Guild hope to bring about
                           a closer harmony and cooperation between men in the Field, and thus advance the standards
                           of window and interior decoration and of civic projects.

                              long been a need for this, and with the organization behind such a movement, art teachers
                              in the rural districts, away from museum facilities, may avail themselves, at postage
                              costs, of an endless supply of reference and technical material.

                        <p id="d73373e760">Certainly one of the most enjoyable of the Christmas spectacles was the presentation
                           of Herbert J. Tily’s cantata “Saints and Seraphs.” Sung by the Strawbridge and Clothier
                           Chorus under the leadership of Dr. Tily, the musical pageant was heard twice daily
                           by thousands of appreciative shoppers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e763">William E. Sparks, a graduate of the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art,
                           was responsible for the major portion of the dramatic setting and scenic effects.
                           For a background Mr. Sparks used a very simple set of fourteenth century style. Three
                           Renaissance arches of the type that appear in so many Italian paintings framed the
                           various tableaux, changes in scene being suggested by variation in the properties.
                           A cypress tree appears in the Annunciation; in the shepherd’s scene a simple rock
                           form gives the locale.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e766">The plotting of the light was effective, particularly in the first episode where Isaiah
                           foretells the birth of Christ, and in the Nativity. This latter scene, where the principle
                           light comes up from the manger, had a chiaroscuro effect that recalled the brilliant
                           contrast in light and dark of the seventeenth century Italian painters. The illusion
                           of depth was obtained by varying lights on a white plaster side behind the set.

                        <p id="d73373e770">Mr. Sparks, in addition to his work for “Saints and Seraphs” also conceived the Christmas
                           pageant at the Fels Planetarium.

                           of exhibitions, sponsored by the Philadelphia Sketch Club, under the auspices of the
                           Exhibition Committee which is headed by Edward Walton. The plans of the Committee
                           are for exhibits more or less devoid of social content and illustration. Other shows
                           of this nature are planned for the future. Due to the small size of the Sketch Club
                           gallery, the number of pictures on view at any one time will necessarily be small
                           but it is hoped that much public interest will be aroused. The first exhibit will

                           has been added to the photographic staff of the Evening Bulletin.

                        <p id="d73373e885">Miss Post, formerly of New York, began serious picture taking some four years ago,
                           when she learned to operate a small camera. Inasmuch as newspaper assignments involve
                           varying conditions of material and work, she has recently taken up one of the fastest
                           cameras in the field, a speed graphic.

                        <p id="d73373e888">Miss Post is not intending to capitalize on feminine fragility, but is going to rival
                           the men at their own game and cover all types of stories.

                           for the artist and the art-lover, has a distinguished list of contributors. Contents
                           of the current issue include articles by Ambroise Vollard and André Gide, and photographs
                           by Man Ray. The cover design is by Henri Matisse. Reproductions in the magazine embrace
                           both full-color works and lithographs. A discussion of “Verve” will be featured in
                           the next issue of the PHILADELPHIA ART NEWS under “Art in Print.”

                        <p id="d73373e933">“It’s the idea, not the equipment, that counts in good photography,” is the maxim
                           that Reuben Goldberg, photographer for the University of Pennsylvania Museum, both
                           preaches and practices. And Mr. Goldberg’s ideas, especially for his work in the University
                           Museum, are original and creative.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e936">Museum photography, as many of us regretfully have learned, has usually been an apathetic
                           business. The cameraman took his object, set it against a light or dark screen, and
                           snapped an accurate, but dry record of its characteristics. We always knew what it
                           WAS, but much less frequently what it EXPRESSED. Few, if any, staff photographers
                           were interested in recording the artistic quality, the individual spirit that set
                           a particular object apart from others of its type and class. Reuben Goldberg has attempted,
                           indeed succeeded, in changing this listless attitude.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e940">For him, the approach is all important. What did the sculptor want to say and what
                           means shall the photographer use to express that message? Sculpture as contrasted
                           with painting is exceedingly difficult to photograph. The painter more or less fixes
                           his effect. The one obstacle is technical—that of separating the colors. But in the
                           reproduction of sculpture, the photographer must attain a plastic viewpoint. He must
                           first take into account the fact that the work of art is three-dimensional. And then
                           equally important are the subtleties of sculpture—line, mass, texture, and light—qualities
                           which must be brought out according to the end toward which the original artist was
                           working.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e943">The use which is made of light and dark in the photograph reproduced below illustrates
                           Mr. Goldberg’s theory. Not only do we realize the actual object, the feeling of the
                           surface, but also, through the placing of the grotesque shadow, we gain something
                           of the effect of awe and horror it must have had on its original spectators.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e946">Of course there is a danger in this more or less dramatic photography. The photographer’s
                           camera enthusiasm may submerge his sculptural enthusiasm. He may over emphasize planes,
                           unnecessarily deepen shadows or lighten highlights. To avoid this, he must keep faithful
                           to the spirit of the original, must gain a complete understanding of the artist’s
                           purpose and work with that purpose always in mind.

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e989">Howard read the manuscript with interest. It was a “reader” for third grade children.
                           “This,” he commented, “would be very nice to illustrate.”
                        </p>

                        <p id="d73373e995">“But,” continued Howard, “it would involve a considerable amount of work. How much
                           had you planned to spend?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e999">“I thought you could do it for about $30.00.”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1002">“$30.00! My heavens!” protested Howard. “Why do you bother with things like this if
                           they pay so badly? A set of drawings such as you want would be worth at least $150
                           or $200.”

                        <p id="d73373e1005">Professor Bronk’s face gloomed, then brightened. “Oh we just wanted very simple drawings

                           we expect them to have tremendous distribution. It would be swell advertising for
                           you, Howard. And of course if you had all ten to illustrate it would come to quite
                           a nice sum of money—Ah, here comes Bert now—”
                        </p>

                        <p id="d73373e1018">“How d’y’do Mr. Slone.” Howard shook hands. “This looks like quite an ambitious undertaking.
                           How many copies do you expect to print and what process will you use?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1021">“We’ll do them 10,000 at a clip and reprint where necessary.”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1024">“Why can’t you pay more for your illustrations if you’re operating on that scale?
                           The cost per copy is very small.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1027">“My dear boy, the investment is terrific! It’ll cost us $200,000 to publish and distribute

                        <p id="d73373e1030">“All right. I’ll make YOU proposition,” said Howard. “I’ll illustrate your readers
                           for $30.00 apiece, plus five per cent of your net profits.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1033">A crafty pause settled over the three men. A look was exchanged by Professor Bronk

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1037">“That is a fair proposal,” agreed Mr. Slone, “but we’ll have to discuss it with the
                           other men who are involved. Suppose you phone Mr. Shater tomorrow morning, Professor,
                           and meanwhile we’ll figure out what we can do.”

                        <p id="d73373e1040">Three days later, Howard Shate met Professor Bronk by chance.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1043">“Oh hello there!” greeted the Professor cordially.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1046">“Hello,” Howard responded “What did you decide to do?”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1049">“Oh we decided not to bother you with these little things. A Phencil is going to do

                           housing. We are contacting and urging every community in the State to get rid of their

                           establish this work along business lines of honest endeavor and divorce it from selfish

                           he seems to demonstrate a desire to surround himself with those who have spent time
                           in the study of the intricate ramifications of this highly specialized field.

                           been definitely concentrating on housing study and research. He was one of the first
                           in this city to realize the need for government participation in this much neglected
                           field and with this in mind became co-author of the first Housing Bill to be introduced
                           in the Legislature in Harrisburg in 1930. In 1936 he went abroad to study and photograph
                           Housing conditions and accomplishments in England and the Scandinavian countries.
                           He has prepared plans for various Housing projects in the Philadelphia area which
                           have been submitted to Washington.

                        <p id="d73373e1118">When I talked with John Graham about his appointment, I could feel within him a burning
                           enthusiasm for this work and a keen desire to serve honestly and well in as much as
                           he may be able.

                           <p id="d73373e1169">I remember how thrilled I was about my first assignment to Europe. The Philadelphia
                              Public Ledger and the New York Evening Post sent me to Paris to cover the Olympic
                              Games in 1924. I sailed March the twenty-second aboard the good ship Rochambeau and
                              the first morning out had an opportunity to unlimber my camera when a passenger jumped
                              overboard in a high running sea. It is unusual to effect a rescue in an emergency
                              like that, because by the time “Man overboard” cries have reached the bridge and the
                              engineers are able to stop the boat the suicide is lost to sight. The Rochambeau hove
                              to finally and started circling around in ever increasing arcs and passengers and
                              crew thronged the rails, straining their eyes for a glimpse of humanity somewhere
                              in those rolling waves. Presently they sighted something infinitesimal bobbing momentarily
                              into sight and then disappearing, to reappear and vanish again far a-starboard. A
                              boat was lowered and headed away followed by the cheers of the passengers. I dashed
                              cabinward in quest of my camera. I returned to deck in time to get a shot as they
                              hauled the struggling would-be suicide over the gunwhales of the lifeboat. The man
                              was an excellent swimmer and evidently changed his mind about suicide when he hit
                              the water, because he was striking out quite strongly when snatched from Davy Jones’
                              locker fully forty-five minutes after his leap. He sat erect and unconcerned as they
                              rowed towards the ship. I went up to the hurricane deck and got some good additional
                              pictures as the freighted lifeboat came up the side to the davits. My choice of the
                              hurricane deck as a point of vantage was good, as rescued and crew disembarked there.
                              A blanket was wrapped about the dripping shoulders and a glass of hot rum thrust into
                              his hand, and I shot that too. I mean the picture. He was, of course, locked in his
                              cabin for the rest of the trip and subsequently turned over to the authorities at
                              Le Havre. The pictures of the event soon appeared in the rotogravures. Even the long-distance
                              shot of the actual rescue enlarged nicely.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d73373e1172">Arriving in Paris I lost no time in reporting to our Paris office at twenty Rue de
                              la Paix. Sam Dashiell, then in charge of that bureau, received me cordially and with
                              his expert guidance and splendid cooperation I was soon organized, in possession of
                              my indispensable Paris police card, more or less oriented, and rapidly learning the
                              ropes. John Chapman, who was in charge of the photographic department of the Pacific
                              and Atlantic Photos at the Chicago Tribune offices, kindly extended the courtesies
                              of his laboratory where I enjoyed the privilege of developing my pictures during my
                              stay in the French capital.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d73373e1175">During the first few days of my visit there all Paris was in a turmoil over the impending
                              state visit of their Majesties King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Roumania. The pictorial
                              highlight of their brief sojourn was to be the placing of a wreath on the tomb of
                              the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe. It developed that a special pass was necessary
                              to cover this ceremony and must be procured from the police. Not having as yet received
                              my official “laisser-passer” I encountered more red-tape than I had bargained for.
                              The royal couple were scheduled to be at the Arc de Triomphe at eleven-thirty that
                              morning and at eleven o’clock I was at the Prefecture, still waiting for that document.
                              I decided to pass up that pass and take my chances on the spot, so I left Paris Officialdom
                              flat and hurried away for location.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d73373e1178">Paris looked as though it was in a state of siege. The beautiful Champs Elysees, flanked
                              the entire length of the avenue by legions of helmeted sky-blue troops, seethed with
                              tanks, artillery, be-plumed officers, curvetting steeds, jingling accoutrements, blaring
                              bands, and everywhere the vivid tri-color. The city was “en fête.” I was stopped at
                              the Champs Elysees entrance to the Arc de Triomphe by a be-sworded officer who demanded
                              my pass. I tried my best French on him but he was adamant. No checkee, no shirtee.
                              In the shadows of the Arc de Triomphe I glimpsed the batteries of cameras lined up
                              and waiting. I pushed through the crowds of spectators seeking one of the other three
                              entrances. Suddenly there was a fanfare of trumpets—the royal cortège arrived with
                              a grand flourish. Troops sprang to attention, presenting arms with rigid precision,
                              and the officers’ blades flashed to salute. I seized the opportunity to slip unnoticed
                              beneath the arches. Climbing the ledges and numerous commemorative plaques I shot
                              over, through, and including the helmets and bayonettes as Queen Marie bent gracefully
                              over the tomb, a magnificent rope of pearls almost sweeping the stone where she laid
                              her offering of blooms near the flickering flame of the eternal torch.

                              arrange themselves solely for pictures. As Queen Marie placed that wreath of flowers
                              she faced my camera and the camera of one other man on my side of the arch, turning
                              her back towards most of the opposite banks of cameras. Hooray for our side! Then
                              I thought with a chuckle of how the late Walter Crail, that diminutive ace of all
                              cameramen, once handled royalty when the King and Queen of Belgium visited Independence
                              Hall in Philadelphia. The King was not standing close enough to the Queen to suit
                              Crail’s sense of composition.

                              in a casual camera ramble. Entering one of his shots in a contest run by a local newspaper,
                              he won a prize of $2.50. It was then submitted in a nation-wide contest where it copped
                              a $50 prize. Not bad at all for an afternoon’s work—or play. Mr. Laws is assistant
                              advertising manager of the Philadelphia Electric Company.

                        <p id="d73373e1360">One of the best ways to get some understanding of a man is to talk with him about
                           his hobby. For in his spare time a man does the things he likes to do in the exact
                           way he likes to do them. And Guy Fry’s hobby is the restoration of the Pennsylvania
                           farmhouse—more specifically, his own place in Thornton.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1363">In an interview with Mr. Fry in his newly acquired offices in the Jerome B. Gray agency,
                           he told me about the restoration process. “We’ve had the place for about 3 years now,
                           and of course there were a lot of things that had to be done, but it’s beginning to
                           look like something now.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1367">That’s more than a man talking about a hobby. That’s a man unconsciously talking about
                           his determination, his thoroughness, his willingness to work, and more important,
                           his contentment. And as he continued I realized that here, also, was a man with a
                           creative urge so deep rooted in him that it was as much a part of him as his dark
                           hair or his smile.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1370">But this interview was to be with an art director, not an architect, carpenter or
                           decorator. “What then, Mr. Fry, do you consider necessary in an ideal art director?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1373">“An ideal art director must be a man who can keep one foot in the production room
                           and one foot in the art room. For to achieve anything concrete in the way of results,
                           the two must work in absolute harmony.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1376">“What do you consider the most important new phase in advertising art?”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1379">“There are two fairly recent developments. First, there is the matter of color photography.
                           It has, in my opinion, brought photography into the realm of real art and it is only
                           in its infancy.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1382">“You think, then, that it will increase?”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1386">“Not only that, but I think that anyone who expects to make a living out of commercial
                           art should become interested in it during its early stages.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1389">“And the second new development?”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1392">“I’m glad to see men of the type of Floyd Davis, Robert Riggs and John La Gatta turn
                           somewhat from illustration and devote some of their time to advertising art. It gives
                           the public a greater opportunity to see their well liked work.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1395">Having met a few art directors before, your reporter put this next question cautiously.
                           “What do you think is wrong with advertising art? What, quite frankly, is your pet
                           peeve?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1398">The eruption, luckily, did not occur. In Mr. Fry’s opinion, however, there is a tendency
                           to overlook the small assignments, many of them being too tritely handled. So little
                           effort is necessary to give a piece that “smart” touch, that no assignment is too
                           small to be done other than well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1401">A product of Industrial Art School, where he met his wife, Mr. Fry has exhibited water
                           colors at the Academy and at the Chester County Art Association in West Chester. Besides
                           home building, his other avocations are a “monotype method of painting . . . and a

                        <p id="d73373e1525">In the experience of every art teacher there are several crosses that have to be borne,
                           whether or no. All teachers have them and while ours seem to be especially galling
                           at times we have a practical way out. One of these crosses is the typically dull group
                           who is farmed out to the art department after trying every other course in the school
                           and are needing three hours credit to graduate.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1528">These past few years I’ve been given such a group, and you know as well as I that
                           the usual art history or theory course offered to college course students would be
                           for them and yourself so much time wasted. For them because of lack of interest in
                           historic form or painting—for you because careful preparation for such a group only
                           to see them fall down on quiz or notebook work because of that lack of interest or
                           being mentally incapable of grasping those things you have to offer.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1532">Let us look at this group of pupils in a humane and sensible light. Being what they
                           are, what are they going to do with their lives on their exodus from the high school?
                           What will they do? What kinds of homes will they have? What will their pleasures be?
                           Then let us formulate a new course in art theory and history or appreciation. We realize
                           that the schools of higher learning they will go to will consist of, at best, mechanics
                           institutes, dressmaking schools and the like, therefore, we are faced with giving
                           them in one short year the most important things they will receive in their secondary
                           training: namely, the elements of beauty to be applied to their own particular job
                           of living.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1535">This entails dress, home and garden—and our text book will have to be magazines and
                           papers they will read in the future. We simply cannot delude ourselves that the one
                           or two classics they laboriously peruse in English classes will instill in them a
                           desire for Dickens, Scott, and Thackeray so fervid that their reading in the future
                           will be influenced by them to the extent that they will frown on all that hasn’t the
                           elements of sound structure, fine writing and subtly turned phrase of, let us say,
                           “Burke’s Speech on Conciliation.” We can thank our everlasting luck that the American
                           magazine is well gotten up and if properly used can be a good text book, and with
                           that admission that I think you will make, let us proceed to this important course
                           for the, until lately, “unimportant general course pupil.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1538">He has a notebook, yes, but the writing he will do will be to explain a clipping he
                           has cut from “BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS” or “THE LADIES’ HOME JOURNAL”—about the inside
                           or outside of his future home. I’ve found them very amenable to suggestion about this
                           future home—very interested. You might start them off with a general talk and class
                           discussion of “If you could, what kind of a room would you make for yourself?” We
                           go backwards or forward, colonial or functional as the individual desires and expresses
                           a preference. Once again interest lies with the student—you—the teacher, the guide.
                           Your job is to show him as many types of good things as possible of his preference
                           and then to open out new fields.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1541">Now for the integration—Home Economics, the shops tie up with the art department in
                           this case and the boys as well as the girls get an insight into home mechanics, learn
                           to respect the girls’ view point and vice versa. This same thing follows in dress
                           and gardening, always taking into consideration the future earning power of the pupil
                           and the location in which he probably will find himself. Integration in this case
                           is indispensable. The course taught in the art department alone would be of value
                           but with the combined efforts of all three departments the worthwhileness is of inestimable
                           value. And I hope to see a time when such a course is set down in the state syllabus
                           as required.

                        <p id="d73373e1544">So the cross that was unwelcome at first can become, you see, one of joy, and one
                           that you can see bringing in dividends from the moment of its inception. All of us
                           who teach in the secondary schools have this opportunity, and we should avail ourselves
                           of it.

                           pictorial commentaries by young boys and girls on their own world of fact and fancy.

                        <p id="d73373e1566">One of the largest groups in the show are the posters designed for the Youth Concerts.
                           These posters, the majority of which are based on some favorite music of the young
                           artist, reveal not only the child’s musical tastes but even more strongly the various
                           ways in which his imagination can work. For instance, the several posters inspired
                           by Debussy’s “Afternoon of a Faun” range from concrete illustration showing a very
                           solid faun in a very green meadow to abstract suggestion through great swirls of color.

                        <p id="d73373e1569">Children follow the foibles of their elders. When they recreate experience which they
                           know deeply either mentally or physically, their work has strength and vitality. Peter
                           Miccolis’ “Shoe Shine Boy,” the foot-ball and base-ball scenes by Francisco Galicia,
                           Charles Brown’s “Steel Workers” are all vivid figure pieces. But Silvio Romano’s “Pals,”
                           a country scene, lacks this vitality, probably because the boy is not familiar with
                           his subject. It is wishful painting, but instead of taking the trend of fancy, it
                           has followed a calendar-top.

                        <p id="d73373e1656">A swift and satisfactory painting technique occurs with the use of dry powdered pigments
                           and egg tempera emulsion. This emulsion is essentially a lean water-color medium which
                           does not permit heavy pastose effects. It dries sufficiently for overpainting within
                           a few minutes. Corrections are easy on its hard surface. It makes possible more precise
                           detail of edges and lines than can be managed with oils.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1659">A finished painting in egg tempera emulsion presents a dull mat surface which is extraordinarily
                           luminous, and can be seen in a far dimmer light than can an oil painting of similar
                           values.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1663">Such a painting does not need to be varnished. It dries so fast that it can be handled
                           for exhibition the day after it is finished. It hardens slowly over a period of a
                           year or two until its egg content is insoluble in water. It is perhaps the most permanent
                           of techniques.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1666">Being lean and luminous and quickly applied, tempera is ideal for underpainting of
                           pictures finished in oil or glazes. Compositional problems can be solved in the underpainting,
                           allowing great sureness and freedom in the overpainting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1669">Contrary to common belief, the technique of tempera emulsion painting is neither difficult
                           nor complicated. The medium makes certain demands quickly learned in experience. Most
                           of the difficulties arise out of the mistaken effort to make tempera behave like water
                           color, which it will not do.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1672">Tempera has its idiosyncrasies, as do oil and water color, and if these are respected
                           the technique responds well to the expression of the individual artist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1675">The method is exceptionally economical. Dry pigments range in price from fifteen cents
                           to ten dollars a pound—and a pound will go a long, long way. One may buy the costlier
                           pigments a few ounces at a time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1678">An excellent tempera emulsion may be purchased from a local manufacturer. This product
                           is, we believe, free from adulterants or preservatives. It keeps indefinitely because
                           in the making it is so thoroughly agitated mechanically that it assumes an almost
                           colloidal state.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1682">However, the artist can make his own emulsion in a few minutes. The homemade emulsion
                           will spoil in a few days in hot weather, but is perfectly satisfactory if promptly
                           used. Here are two practical formulae:—

                              merely of mixing the powders with emulsion by means of a spatula or palette knife
                              to the useable consistency of thick cream. This scarcely takes longer than mixing
                              tones on the usual oil palette. Mix on plate glass, a dinner plate, a slab of porcelain
                              or of marble. Stand a jar of water beside your emulsion for washing brushes and thinning
                              paint for special effects. Large preliminary effects can be done easily by pulling

                        <p id="d73373e1804">George Bellows’ eulogy of the book expresses fully, I believe, the opinion of all
                           who have read Henri’s Notes. He says, “I would give anything to have come by this
                           book years ago. It is in my opinion comparable only to the notes of Leonardo and Sir
                           Joshua” (there is that man again), “but infinitely more suggestive than either of
                           these to the artists of today . . . When I listen to Henri talk, or read his book,
                           I say to myself his is one of the finest voices which express the philosophy of modern
                           man in painting.” A fine tribute to a great book.

                        <p id="d73373e1807">“The Art Spirit” can pretty definitely stand on its own record as a best seller. It
                           has had lord knows how many printings, and the copies I have seen in Artist’s Studio

                           generally accepted as the father of modern American painting. It was he who was responsible
                           for the inauguration of the first American Independent Exhibition, the forerunner
                           of the present day Independent Society “The Art Spirit” shows clearly the inspirational
                           system of this great teacher, representing a compilation of his notes and correspondence
                           during a quarter of a century.

                        <p id="d73373e1948">Yesterday’s post brought your quite acute comments on our little “show” at the Plastic
                           Club. Did you happen to notice the dates on most of my canvasses, 1897–98–99? Lest
                           you should be overcome by the recollection of those appealing though elegant lines:

                        <p id="d73373e1958">I must add that most of those canvasses were painted when I was between the ages of
                           seventeen and nineteen years old. I know that much of the color has faded out of them.
                           My excuse for showing them is that they have a luscious quality of pigment which has
                           its own beauty. One well known painter who came to the private view said, “All the
                           things that were influenced by the School of Paris at that time had a certain interest.”
                           “At that time” I had certainly never heard of the School of Paris, let alone seen
                           it. Someone told me that a man named Monet was using broken color. That possibly set
                           me off, with the added inspiration of Whistler’s rather beautiful Victorian chastity!

                           at the University in the kind of condition that we would like to. The vast majority
                           of the pictures, however, are in fair condition, and, when more funds are available,
                           we will endeavor to keep them in as first-class condition as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1977">I am sorry that the writer of the article was unable to find the two Eakins portraits.
                           They both are hanging in the Medical School.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e1980">There is quite a little interest in our paintings as evidenced by the visits that
                           we get very frequently from those interested in either historical matters or in early
                           American portraits. Some of these portraits have been at the University for over a
                           hundred years and have an historical interest, as well as a University interest.

                        <p id="d73373e1983">If there is any information that you or Miss Richter would like to have concerning
                           our paintings, or any facts that we can give you, we will be very glad to help you
                           at any time. With best wishes, I am

                        <p id="d73373e1999">You have asked for an expression of opinion concerning the black-and-white reproductions
                           of work by Philadelphia artists, enclosed with the Philadelphia Art News. My advice
                           would be that they may be easily omitted without harming the paper, if the examples
                           we have had are typical of those which might be published in the future.

                        <p id="d73373e2015">“A few days ago I received my first copy of your publication, having subscribed to
                           same in the hope that it would be a good addition to my professional reading.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d73373e2018">If this copy is what I may expect in future issues I am more than pleased, in addition
                           to fulfilling its specific duty, a more refreshing hours reading would be difficult
                           to find. The presentation of different divisions is cleverly done in a way that, rank
                           amateur that I am, sufficient understanding is possible.

                           capably handled in your magazine, and also it seems to me that Art Directors and Teachers
                           everywhere could profit much by the technical information to be found elsewhere in
                           its pages.
