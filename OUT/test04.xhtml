                        the work in copies or phonorecords. This right is subject to certain limitations found
                        in sections 107 through <a href="http://www.example.org/USA/Massachusetts/Rehoboth#Anawan" class="ref-external">118</a> of the copyright act (title 17, U.S. Code). One of the more important limitations
                        is the doctrine of “fair use.” Although fair use was not mentioned in the previous
                        copyright law, the doctrine has developed through a substantial number of court decisions
                        over the years. This doctrine has been codified in section 107 of the copyright law.

                     <p id="d51e60">Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the reproduction of
                        a particular work may be considered “fair,” such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
                        teaching, scholarship, and research. Section 107 also sets out four factors to be
                        consid- ered in determining whether or not a particular use is fair:

                        taken without permission. Acknowledging the source of the copyrighted material does
                        not substitute for obtaining permission.

                        Copyright Law cites examples of activities that courts have regarded as fair use:
                        “quotation of ex- cerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or
                        comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration
                        or clarification of the author’s observations; use in a parody of some of the content
                        of the work parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in
                        a news report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of
                        a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to
                        illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legis- lative or judicial proceedings

                        The Copy- right Office can neither determine if a certain use may be considered “fair”
                        nor advise on possible copyright violations. If there is any doubt, it is advisable
