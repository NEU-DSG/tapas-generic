                        <p id="d13883e197">An engaging aspect of the American parade at the Art Alliance, shown in the Fifteenth
                           Annual of American Prints, is the united front of lithographers in a solid soapstone
                           wall. Allegiance is so nearly complete that work in other forms of print making is
                           coquettishly rare. But a print show which turns into a very good display of lithographs
                           is also quite concretely national, as odorously of our land as the collections of
                           the Whitney Museum; and if American Art is turning to stone, make what you can of
                           it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e200">Another fact surprisingly shown among the accomplishments of the very earnest jury,
                           is a measure of the work of the jurors; whose qualities shine in a show from which
                           they slyly, or shyly, excluded themselves. Esherick, Pearson and Bailey exact an expertness
                           and worth from the worker; and a high level of excellence through the exhibition does
                           honor to their sincerity, their respect for dispatch. Bacon’s wit and Nura’s fresh
                           point of view, account for fancies and humors, both ill met, and well met in quite
                           many examples; as Baker, Becker, Biddle and Gag.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e203">The Prize winner, a stunning mix-up of silhouette and white line, and a good humored
                           picture of a goat escaping a downpour in the battered wreck of a car (called “Housing
                           Problem,” by Grace Albee) should also win an award for daring to be a wood cut among
                           stone prints—
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e207">In a similar way, honorable mention is earned by Eugene Morely because of a fine and
                           subtle respect he has for ink, which makes his prints important as black and white;
                           rather than as lithographs. His three examples are rich in artistic value, though
                           the drama of “Mine Rescue” is fuller, and as well expressed as the simpler story in
                           the rather pat “Pothole.” The artist, rather than the print is first in his case.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e210">As a pleasant game, and not merely to quibble—allow us to question the other mention.
                           Yes, or no?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e213">Why is 25 singled out for mention rather than number 8, or 28, 44, 45, 55, 70, 82,
                           86 or 115? (To play this game you must see the show, and you really should!)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e216">A quick look at the exhibition would leave one under the impression that several good
                           prints were done by Orozco, and as many by Kuniyoski, with perhaps five more by Thomas
                           Benton. Of these three influences, only “From Boardwalk” by Kuniyoski is there to
                           be weighed with the works of his admirers, and also to show what he has, to be so
                           admired. Lois Wilcox, Esther Williams, and Will Barnet (remember him? he got honorable
                           mention) are a minor trio with personal qualities—How nationalism outruns the individual.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e219">Except in the quaint “Transportation” of Clara Mahl, lithographs by the artists of
                           the Federal Art Project quite take over the show. Among a fine group of their color
                           prints, three of the nation’s employees are going to town; Peck, Gottlieb and Fousek.
                           This group gives a stimulating exposition of the rich resources of color lithography,
                           a field left unspoiled by Currier and Ives. “Winter” is here, by Russell Limbach,
                           and should win the popular prize.

                        <p id="d13883e239">Continuing its policy of showing works of art in their original setting, the Pennsylvania
                           Museum of Art has just opened a sixteenth century Spanish Renaissance room, the gift
                           of Mrs. Frank Thorne Patterson.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e242">“The room . . . is reminiscent of Spain in its days of prosperity and world-wide power.
                           The austerity of this sparsely furnished room . . . reveals the old Spanish temperament
                           and displays its authentic sixteenth century setting”, said Fiske Kimball, director
                           of the museum.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e245">Architecturally the room is distinguished by three wooden doorways. Two are sixteenth
                           century examples from Ecija, in Andalusia, elaborately carved in geometric designs.
                           The third door, from seventeenth century Seville, is rich in geometric moldings, and,
                           in its acanthus leaf carving, shows a merging of Moorish influence with that of the
                           Plateresco. The architecture of the room also includes a very fine sixteenth century
                           ceiling from Seville, red tile floor, and pure white walls.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e249">The furnishings in the room consist of a number of chairs of the period, several of
                           which were supplied by Mrs. Patterson or her family, a very characteristic cabinet
                           or vargueno, lent by Mr. Raymond Pitcairn, a carpet from the Joseph Lees Williams
                           Memorial Collection, a glazed Hispano-Moresque plate, and a jar of Talavera pottery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e252">The one painting in the room “Madonna and Child” by Ribera is described by Mr. Kimball
                           as reflecting the “strong and sometimes fanatical religious feeling so inherent in
                           the Spanish race”. The painting is from the William L. Elkins Collection.

                        <p id="d13883e492">Once upon a time there was a man named Jones. Being a philosopher, and somewhat critical,
                           he devised the theory that A, when considered in relation to B, produced an effect
                           somewhat comparable to C.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e495">Naturally, all philosophical and critical progress would, at this moment, have reached
                           an enchanting impasse, had not Mr. Jones been suddenly confronted by the ominous presence
                           of Mr. Smith.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e498">Smith was likewise a philosopher, and equally critical, but his ideas differed palpably
                           from those of Mr. Jones. “Why,” asked Mr. Smith, “should A and B equal C? X appears
                           the logical conclusion.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e502">That, in essence, constitutes the greatest of all possible factors in the intelligent
                           critical life of man. Mr. Jones, no matter what his critical conclusions may be, will
                           inevitably find himself in the presence of Mr. Smith, who contradicts with impunity,
                           and asserts the undeniable fact that Mr. Jones MAY be wrong.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e505">The worst, and best, of this situation is that Mr. Smith might really have the correct
                           solution, and even if he has not, he succeeds in paving the way toward constructive
                           discussion—and ultimate truth, if there is such a thing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e508">So, hurrah for Mr. Smith! If he reads our column and doesn’t like it, we hope he’ll
                           have the courage of his convictions—enough courage, at any rate, to write directly
                           to us and tell us about it. Then we can have a verbal free-for-all, and all the mutual
                           benefit that goes with it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e511">Here’s a toast to Mr. Smith!</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e514">Contemporary American painters are yours for the looking at the Art Alliance. John
                           Steuart Curry is much in evidence—represented by several canvases, notably a forceful
                           self portrait and the dramatic, rapidly-moving acrobats and horses. David McCosh shows
                           a “Winter Landscape” extremely direct in its interpretation of bleak sky and snow-blanketed
                           mountains.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e517">Andree Ruellan, in a study of negroes, manifests a fine sense of color tone no less
                           than acute draughtsmanship, and shows all the earmarks of one of the best painters
                           in the exhibit. Doris Lee strikes the decorative and, in certain ways, quaint note
                           with her canvas of ice skaters, with its background of tiny houses, trees and mountains,
                           against a blazing sky. Equally quaint, and almost like a print of Currier and Ives,
                           is this artist’s “Hudson River Excursion.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e521">Other painters represented are Alexander James, Daniel Celentano, Lee Townsend, Joe
                           Jones and Molly Luce.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e524">The exhibit of oils by members of the Art Alliance includes Paul Wescott, Edith Emerson,
                           Nancy Ferguson, Margaret Gest, Sue May Gill, Louise Wood Wright, Caroline Grainger,
                           Katherine McCormack, Ralph McLellan, Pearl Van Sciver, Katherine Farrell, Arrah Lee
                           Gaul, Hortense Ferne, and Mary Townsend Mason.

                        <p id="d13883e527">Supplementing this is an exhibition of crafts by Alliance members.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e530">Vigor of treatment is by all means the outstanding quality of the oils and water colors
                           by Catherine Morris Wright, currently on view at McClees Galleries. “Furnace at Ajax
                           Metal Co.” has all the contrast necessary for its subject matter—the well controlled
                           fire has not killed the rest of the composition. Considerably more than commendable
                           is “Ice Storm,” an unusually successful study in gray. “Life for One” is a large canvas
                           of whirling waterfall with dramatic suggestion and tremendously active composition,
                           while in contrast, “Library of Pennsylvania Hospital” breathes the peace and quiet
                           of a successfully handled interior.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e533">In “March Romp” we find a boy and girl skating on ice—extremely fresh and joyous in
                           color. “The Walk in the Snow” manifests an extraordinary sense of the bleakness of
                           winter, “Three Girls” is an eloquent commentary on mother, child and baby, quiet despite
                           its vigorous technique, and two small canvases, “Sombre Day” and “Bright Day,” are
                           as exquisite as they are small; the rocks and the sea are little gems. Other notable
                           oils are “Evening Breeze,” “Evening Meal,” “Lonely Giant,” “Late Picnic” and “Twilight.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e536">The water colors are characterized by as much vigor as the oils. The artist has learned
                           to utilize this medium with due economy of means. Figure studies are simply handled,
                           while rocks and water have unusual strength and motion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e540">At the Women’s University Club we find painting and drawings, by Violet Oakley and
                           Edith Emerson—academic, to be sure, but exceedingly expressive.

                        <p id="d13883e543">Edith Emerson’s contributions are mostly portraits. Occasional studies of mountains,
                           sea or landscapes add notably to the show. The blue and white of “Mont Blanc, Chamonix”
                           and “Procession of the Knights of the Grail, Mont Silvat” are worth more than one
                           look.

                        <p id="d13883e546">“Her First Born Son” is an eloquent study, rich in color, and “The Nawab Sir Vmar
                           Hayat Khan Tiwana” is remarkable for its draughtsmanship. Other portraits by Violet
                           Oakley include the Right Honorable the Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, Rev. Frederick
                           R. Griffin and Katherine Drinker Bowen.

                        <p id="d13883e549">Edith Emerson’s water color group including studies of mountains and landscapes, have
                           immense verve and refreshing utilization of brush stroke. Her portraits are inclined
                           rather toward the poetic, with the exception of a vigorous delineation of Amelia Earhart,
                           accomplished in a style eminently in keeping with the boldness, frankness and courage
                           of its late subject.

                        <p id="d13883e552">Among Miss Emerson’s portraits are such notables as H. R. H. Princess Irene of Greece,
                           and Her Late Majesty Queen Sophie of Greece.

                        <p id="d13883e564">A remarkable example of the Oriental and Occidental combination is to be found at
                           the Boyer Galleries in an exhibit of the latest work of Emma Lu Davis. Certainly the
                           paramount characteristic of this show is Miss Davis’s unique vision, and she manifests
                           preeminently the rather rare ability to wed subject with appropriate manner of treatment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e567">In her carved work, Miss Davis is not limited to any one material—rather, we frequently
                           encounter a combination of material in the same statue. We cite, as an excellent example,
                           the walnut polychrome head of a “Khevsur Woman”, a thoroughly beautiful combination
                           of visional sophistication and archaic linear handling. The eyes are colored, the
                           earrings are of metal, and the head-dress most provocative. Also in walnut polychrome
                           are “Head ‘Chinese Red Army Soldier’” (an elemental creation, with the peak of the
                           soldier’s cap in motal) and “Head ‘Hsiao Di-Di’” (the most emotionally Oriental piece
                           of modern sculpture we have seen for a long while).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e570">A “Peking Coolie” is accomplished in terra cotta, with a delicately tinted surface,
                           and almond eyes that have been cut completely through the mask. A rather startling
                           pure white “Duck” reveals itself as pine wood, and hovers above a violently green,
                           melon-like form. It attains great purity of effect.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e573">With the exception of Noguchi’s scrolls, those of Emma Lu Davis are beyond doubt the
                           most striking modern works in this vein that we have seen. However, calligraphy is
                           tempted to run away with itself, and sometimes does. “Earth Figures, Spring” is the
                           remarkable—extraordinary in its vigor, spontaneity of brush stroke, and rather conspicuous
                           sexual symbolism.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e576">Despite its black and white, “Dozing Cat” is one of the most vivid of the scrolls,
                           and “Sub Griffin”, with its reddish and black tones, is extremely direct in handling,
                           and quite Japanesque in effect. The numerous studies of horses are equally amusing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e579">On first view the work of Abraham Chanin, also at Boyer’s appears bizarre with a vengeance—on
                           second thought, rather logical.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e583">Rouault has left an indelible imprint upon Chanin—more than notably in such works
                           as “Backstage,” “Posing,” “Comedian and Stooge” and “Scarlet Headdress.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e586">“The Big Hat” (also rather Rouault) does lots to us emotionally—there is vigor and
                           a great deal of lust for paint. The same may be said for “Mary Joyce.”
                        </p>

                           been decided with almost too much logic, as have the ideas. “Sonnet VIII: Music to
                           Hear, Why Hearest Thou Music Sadly” is the nearest thing to a gem in the show.

                        <p id="d13883e595">A group of small water colors in the back gallery is, pigmentally, the lustiest of
                           all—it is by all means a bizarre group, but we imagine we would live with any one
                           of them for a long while.

                           All in all, there is more to them than meets the casual eye, and they deserve much

                        <p id="d13883e601">“Sisters” is a delicate, poetic tonal commentary, simple in draughtsmanship. “Pussy
                           cat, pussy cat, where have you been,” accomplished with a black background, suggests
                           principally that the pussy in question has been raiding all the nearby garbage cans,
                           and, if you don’t believe us, observe the feline stomach.

                        <p id="d13883e605">There are a number of animal studies along more or less conventional Biddle lines.
                           However, we also find several recent female nudes in which the artist strays courageously
                           from his accustomed path, and adds tremendously to technical interest. This applies
                           likewise to several prints made with touch and brush—quite free and refreshing.

                           and “Let Them Eat Cake,” a double portrait, is a vicious social commentary, closely
                           akin to caricature.

                           buds or flowers, the artist is quick to hit upon the essential decorative element,
                           and turn it to vivid account.

                           There is a certain amount of Demuth in them, but they are genuine and have charming
                           delicacy. Mrs. Mildred Eckert Landis, who teaches commercial art at the Mastbaum Vocational
                           School, grasps the substance of things, and accomplishes her paintings vigorously,
                           with lusty, well rounded color.

                           Mrs. Elizabeth Derbyshire boasts previous art training, and her landscapes have both

                           The still life, “Black Jug”, we consider the best—it is fluid and graceful, but strong.

                           at the Plastic Club proves that patience is not a lost virtue in graphic art. The
                           prints are mostly architectural, but there are many figures and a few landscapes.

                        <p id="d13883e642">In subject matter, the architectural studies are the best. There is a fair sense of
                           design, but rarely any contrast. Technically, the mezzotints are not the greatest
                           we have seen, but they have softness of tone to commend them.

                        <p id="d13883e646">The figures, while lacking in verve, possess a naivete akin to some early American
                           prints, and the general stiffness of their postures and their meticulous stippling
                           add to this effect. The best print in the show is “Fish and Birds”, a really creative
                           etching and one that has more than a little plastic imagination. We should like to
                           see more of such compositions from this artist’s needle.

                           inhibited—I shall acquire a collection; because I like artists and a work of art is
                           a superior, noble thing. The difference between me and the other collectors is only
                           that I do not want the most of the best, because I can’t buy it. Like everyone else,

                           up of Titian and Poussin, colored by Pissaro; the old man of Aix was simple, but not
                           that small.

                        <p id="d13883e665">“The Pellerin canvas has been called Cézanne’s most important composition, worthy
                           of a great artist; Dr. Barnes alone says it isn’t.

                        <p id="d13883e669">“Furthermore, it is not likely that the chief item in the Pellerin collection was
                           for sale earlier than a year ago—such deals are usually a matter of record—

                           to be a misfit? Some day, I may want a new coat to match the pants.”

                        <p id="d13883e724">“The modern architect,” he continued, “distributes space for use. The traditional
                           architect distributes ornament for inconvenience. The tower has no relation to the
                           internal economy of structure of the Bulletin building. For years the entrance, windows,
                           counters and desks of its Front Office were as badly arranged as possible to justify
                           a monumental fancy. We have corrected all that.

                        <p id="d13883e727">“Competent critics generally agree that the appearance of the building is improved
                           by this logical change.”

                        <p id="d13883e730">It is gratifying to know that in our city is a man who will follow through to the
                           end without a shaded, uncertain compromise. A building is created for use—function.
                           George Howe’s job was to house most perfectly an organic business unit. If he considered,
                           after careful analysis, that the loss of space resulting from the rounding of a corner,
                           merely to follow an old tower form, was uneconomical, then by so doing he would compromise.
                           He would have had a misfit with relation to a functional working unit. This is honest
                           and sound reasoning.

                        <p id="d13883e733">Few will deny the feeling of rightness when they enter the office. In this room work
                           can be done, clean, crisp and sure. The eye rests easily on the blue-veined marble
                           floor, the gray granite columns, the soft white ceiling. The outer walls are built
                           of light itself. It is the architecture of the Prism, in which light is thoughtfully
                           redirected for use in special purity. Glass brick or tile, possibly more than any
                           other contemporary material, seems to be a part of the life in which we live or dream
                           to live.

                        <p id="d13883e736">The dominating so called decorative feature of the room is the great world map with
                           time zones. This occupies almost an entire wall and is constructed, as a giant jigsaw
                           puzzle, of hundreds of pieces of colored formica. It is decoration with a reason,
                           useful and functional. So also is the large transportation map of Philadelphia and
                           the Time Showing device composed of Neon letters which change every minute. There
                           is no “ornament for inconvenience” here.

                        <p id="d13883e740">As a contrast in point of time, there is the recent activity of another Philadelphia
                           architect which had to do with a civilization flourishing eight thousand years ago
                           on the plains of Mesopotamia, not far from the fabled city of Bagdad. It was to this
                           now arid desert that Alfred Bendiner went this last year to help in unearthing a lost
                           civilization. He served as artist to the Expedition sent by the University Museum
                           of the University of Pennsylvania, headed by Dr. E. A. Speiser.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e743">In his Spruce Street studio last week, Mr. Bendiner showed us many drawings and told
                           us much of great interest. An artist’s real job on such an expedition seems to be
                           not only the making of pretty pictures but particularly the making of hundreds of
                           accurate, measured drawings and water colors of all important finds. This totalled
                           within a years’ time some six hundred Pen and Inks, about twenty water colors and
                           two large crayon drawings. The crayon drawings are at present on exhibition in the
                           Water Color Show at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and besides being original
                           in character and composition depict most ingeniously the architecture, costumes and
                           life of the village of Tepe Gawara in which the expedition was quartered.

                        <p id="d13883e746">“Do not imagine,” said Mr. Bendiner, “That because we were located in a native village
                           situated in a Mesopotamian desert, I worked under great difficulties in making these
                           drawings. On the contrary, the accommodations equalled if not surpassed those of many
                           an American artist’s studio. Here in America we do not often have servants to light
                           our cigarettes and clean our pen-points. There we did.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e749">“However, the drafting room was on the second floor of a mud brick building, so conceived
                           that the floor swung from branches of trees used as floor joists. Therefore complete
                           quiet was compulsory in order to avoid noticeable sway. We had to put up signs in
                           English and Arabic which read ‘DON’T MOVE.’”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e752">He told us many things about the Devil-worshipping native Yazida, of their expertness
                           in sounding earth for ancient walls and buried objects, of their inability to fathom
                           what all this digging was about and of the layer upon layer of civilizations that
                           lived so long ago. But what interested me most in its relation to our own contemporary
                           life, were the little figures and pottery that they found in these ancient mounds.
                           Here was purity of form, mass, color and design. Some of it might have been done by
                           the most contemporary of our present designers. It made the eight thousand years seem
                           a very short period of time. It made me feel that the same force impelled this old
                           civilization as that which impels many of us today—the force to create now, out of
                           and for the life that is now. This is important in any art which wills to endure as
                           a vital force.

                           more obvious in its posing; though thanks to determination, the more painted picture.
                           It has all the faults of the other ‘Bathers,’ with more finish.”

                           <p id="d13883e783">“Some of the Bathers are very beautiful—though never sentimental or pretty—studies
                              of the human form; but many of them are awkwardly, even grotesquely, posed, and on
                              the whole they are the least ‘realized’ of Cézanne’s works. Compared with his landscapes,
                              portraits, and still lifes, his nudes must be rated as incomplete, only partially
                              successful attempts to solve a problem for which the means at his disposal were inadequate.
                              The difficulty lay not in the conception but in the limitations imposed by temperament
                              and circumstances.”

                              as the Bathers, did he habitually work without having an actual model before him.
                              This does not mean, however, that Cézanne miraculously freed himself from his usual
                              dependence on a model when he painted these nudes.”

                              Barnes Foundation the choice is a difficult one, although I make it without hesitation.
                              To me, the infinitely superior interlocking of the figures in the Barnes picture—after
                              all the kernel of the composition, without which it would be meaningless—more than
                              makes up for the poetic arch of trees which the considerably higher Pellerin canvas
                              allows. In reality these are two quite different pictures: The Paris Baigneuses is
                              a Homeric effort, in which the grandeur of plan transcends its unequal realization;

                        <p id="d13883e839">Mr. Henry Ford has again purchased for the Edison Institute at Dearborn, Michigan,
                           a group of drawings by Joseph Boggs Beale, bringing the total number of Beale’s works
                           permanently on exhibition there to fourteen.

                        <p id="d13883e842">The drawings by Beale, discovered in 1935 by Arthur W. Colen, Director of the Modern
                           Galleries in Philadelphia, and reported in Time magazine “as the most remarkable find
                           in the realm of Americana,” are now finding their way into many museums and private
                           collections.

                        <p id="d13883e845">Beale, an intimate friend of Lincoln, Grant and other famous people of his day, was
                           a descendant of a long line of Philadelphians, prominent in the social, civic and
                           professional life of the city, Betsy Ross being a great grand aunt. “Professor” of
                           drawing at the Central High School, he studied with Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy
                           of the Fine Arts.

                        <p id="d13883e848">Some of Beale’s most remarkable drawings are satires with all the flavor of Cruickshank
                           or Hogarth, but when he speaks in his diary of his admiration for the French illustrator,
                           Dore, he indicates the influence which accounts in some measure for his style. There
                           is a similarity in the compositions of these two artists, although Beale shows a distinctive
                           means of rendering.

                        <p id="d13883e909">I was variously educated in Asbury Park public school, learning how to eat licorice
                           sticks behind the third grade geography, and use, tho not understand, bad words.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e912">Long before the third grade, however, I drew and modelled, loving animals particularly.
                           I suppose this was because even at the age of four or five I was endlessly fascinated
                           by bodies. Only animal bodies were visible at that era. California influence had not
                           made itself felt and mohair and alpaca shrouded the human form even on the beaches.
                           Ladies were considered to be solid around the hem.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e916">Four years of boarding school and another four of college taught me a good deal more
                           about people and the shapes and sizes in which they grew, and I began drawing portraits
                           in my spare time. Caesar’s dull campaigns and the confusion of trigonometry reduced
                           the “spare time” to a very small margin indeed, but I determined that when I had finished
                           formal education, I should go to art school and do what I had wanted to do all my
                           life.

                        <p id="d13883e919">So I set to work in 1927 to become an artist in spite of the Pennsylvania Academy
                           of the Fine Arts, that old men’s home for aesthetic sidetracks and decorous caution.

                        <p id="d13883e922">At the end of my third year, I had the honor to win one of the Cresson awards—travelling
                           scholarships carrying a stipend of $1000. I also won a prize for the best drawing
                           of animals made during the school year. The travelling scholarship I did not accept,
                           for after three years of the Academy, I was sick to death of art—school art—and wanted
                           nothing but a summer of tennis and swimming in California.

                        <p id="d13883e925">In the fall I returned East, full of hope and sunburn and started trying to make art
                           pay, and it did, tho not much. I took every order that came along; posters, stencil
                           designs for Italian restaurants, painted screens for sportsmen, portraits or horses
                           in pastel and of children in bas-relief, commissions to design and make modern furniture
                           and even an order for a tombstone. This varied work added nothing to modern American
                           Art, but taught me a great deal about working quickly and well in various materials.

                        <p id="d13883e928">In 1933 Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the Dymaxion house and co-inventor with Starling
                           Burgess of the Dymaxion car, invited me to work in the Dymaxion factory.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e931">There followed the most instructive and inventive six months of my life. Dymaxion
                           plant gave me exactly what I wanted, the things the Academy of Fine Arts could not
                           give—that is, the principles of good workmanship. I think there are a great many “artists”
                           in the work but awfully few real craftsmen. Use of tools, and neat, fast, strong instruction
                           are not taught much in art schools.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e935">It was in Dymaxion that I made my first experiments with abstract forms; Starling
                           Burgess had a six foot model of the hull of one of his cup-defenders hanging in the
                           office—a great, white, flying shape. It was one of the most beautiful things I had
                           ever seen and awakened in me an interest in shape simply as shape. At this time I
                           did the large bird-like form called “A Cosmic Presence.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e938">Leaving the Dymaxion with a new knowledge of technique, particularly in working wood,
                           and with a keener interest in everything, I worked four months for P. W. A. P. making
                           a set of illustrations for a book published by the Museum of Natural History, and
                           a bust of Horace Greeley for City College. During the course of the year I executed
                           a number of small private commissions and exhibited work in the Architectural League
                           in New York, the Woodstock Gallery, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Annual.

                        <p id="d13883e941">Then in the Spring of 1935 I went to Russia. I wanted to see how the artists were
                           organized over there, how they were utilized in the scheme of life, and how socialized
                           patronage affected the arts.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e944">I found that from an economic-social standpoint the Soviet artist enjoys the happiest
                           situation in the world—as a trade union member he enjoys protection and social security,
                           he never lacks employment, and building and decorative projects are broad enough to
                           include all varieties of work—except good work. This, I believe, was in no way the
                           fault of socialism. Soviet artists are not regimented any more than artists in other
                           countries, but it happens that the pressure of popular taste is toward bad and tawdry
                           styles in painting and sculpture. Russia has not a broad or intelligent popular base
                           of appreciation of beautiful projects. The Russian tradition of real folk painting
                           disappeared four or five hundred years ago with the last of the fine ikons. Since
                           then there has been nothing but a second-rate tradition of academic paint and clay
                           pushing.

                           because the cheap academic traditions have been continued under the name of “socialist
                           realism”—that is all the facts and none of the meaning of the subject.

                        <p id="d13883e950">Now I am chiefly concerned with the development of cooperative artists groups in America.
                           I feel that cooperation within the craft, and public patronage in a generous scale,
                           but not connected with relief, are the hope of American artists. I like my own country
                           and my craft, and I watch with satisfaction the growth of a self-conscious Americana,
                           and of a feeling of solidarity and social-consciousness among American artists.

                        <p id="d13883e976">A Portrait Painter whom I know accepted a commission to paint the likeness of a little
                           girl.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e979">When the last changes on the eyes and mouth and curls had been made and the picture
                           was pronounced complete by Artist and by Mother, the Mother said, “I love it! It’s
                           a PERFECT likeness! It fairly LIVES! You must take this check—and I’ll have the balance
                           for you next week.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e982">“Thank you so much.” The artist accepted the partial payment for his work</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e985">The Mother was so proud of her new portrait that she invited seventy-five of her friends
                           to view it. She may have been just a little unsure of their reaction—as one always
                           is about a portrait, you know—for she didn’t include the Artist in the group. However,
                           the seventy-five guests came and immediately exclaimed over the wonders of the work.
                           Everyone liked it. Several said “Oh, I’d love to have a portrait like that!” The Mother
                           was most agreeably titillated.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e989">Now among these seventy-five friends was one Important Dowager with a deep, round
                           voice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e992">“My dear,” she exclaimed, richly, “it’s a marvelous piece of work . . . but . . .
                           there is just one little thing . . . Why did you let him make her eyes that color?
                           They just miss being right!”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e995">The other seventy-four guests refocussed their lagging attention keyed to agreement
                           with the impressive Mentor who was speaking.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e998">“I thought that too,” interrupted a not-quite-so-young, unmarried lady.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1001">“I could tell him exactly what to do,” continued the Dowager ignoring the interruption.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1004">“Could you?” asked the Mother anxiously.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1008">“I’d be glad to. I’ll drop in at his studio next time I go to town. You bring the
                           portrait and we’ll have it made just right.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1011">With a faint sense of relief, tinged with disappointment the Mother watched her erstwhile
                           enthusiastic guests depart. The gathering dispersed with a tone of surface brightness,
                           and tactful Talk of Other Things.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1014">Three weeks later the Portrait Painter phoned the Mother.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1017">“Oh yes, Mr. Daub. I still like the portrait. But Madame Dickerflit has some suggestions
                           on it. She has such marvelous taste! Oh—just little things. I’m sure you can do it
                           in just a few minutes. Yes we’ll bring it in some day soon . . . just as soon as Madame
                           Dickerflit gets back from Bermuda . . . Yes . . . I’ll phone you . . .”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1020">Somehow Madame Dickerflit never found it convenient to go to Mr. Daub’s studio, nor
                           the Mother to pay the balance of her bill, nor any of the seventy-five friends to
                           order portraits from the Painter.

                           executed by the D’Ascenzo Studios for the Chapel of the Holy Spirit, The National
                           Cathedral, Washington, D. C. Since an inspirational subject was required, the artist
                           has taken as his theme Christ and the Woman of Samaria, the same subject which Rembrandt
                           used in the etching also reproduced here. The contrast in conception by these two
                           artists proves an interesting commentary on the results obtained from the different
                           methods and media of individual workers.

                        <p id="d13883e1048">In the D’Ascenzo window fourteenth century design is presented in the well developed
                           canopies of the two lancets and the architectural bases of the two figures, but the
                           color is decidedly not the color of Chartres so assiduously copied in recent years
                           by the designers in stained glass. It is rather the color and light of sunny Spain
                           brought into an American cathedral. Glowing light dominates in spite of the northern
                           exposure, and in this respect the artist and his associates have succeeded in developing
                           a new note of optimism in American stained glass.

                           among the first to follow its lead. This will be the first exhibition of its kind
                           to be held in this country.

                           enraptured at one of his heroic creations, who asked, “How long you been workin’ on

                           Harding took them to the hotel one Saturday morning. The management had arranged for
                           the room to be closed from Saturday until Monday night, to give the artist sufficient
                           time to install the panels. A guest of the hotel happened to wander in just as Harding

                        <p id="d13883e1222">Angles are wangled in modern photography . . . not just haphazard. The making of pictures
                           from an unusual viewpoint, regarded by many as a stunt, is in reality a serious effort
                           to record a sensation . . . to capture a fleeting moment . . . to imprison a mood.
                           Motion is thereby imparted to the otherwise static . . . mobility to the immobile.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1226">The slightest change of angle of a camera brings about a corresponding change of position
                           in relation to the other surrounding objects, varying the motif, presenting strange
                           and intriguing perspectives.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1229">Planned accidental accents are achieved and drama is born. Attention is arrested.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1232">Modern momentum and the camera have created a new slant on this world of ours. We
                           have become angle conscious. Emerging from the depths of the subway, our eyes, momentarily
                           on the level of the street, glimpse the worms’ eye view, and tall buildings go off
                           at dizzy tangents. These our minds instantly straighten . . . knowing what we know.
                           But the sensation is there and is felt. The birds’ eye view has become increasingly
                           familiar to us all from the vantage of the elevated, office windows, and tops of skyscrapers.
                           The airlines have given us startling and beautiful patterns from the sky.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1235">Camera angles permit us to experience and record the quintessence of sensation, translating
                           into definite form the realism and emotion we feel. There’s all the difference in
                           the world between calmly contemplating a roller-coaster from the ground and swooping
                           thrillingly earthward from the topmost summit in the very last car. Hold your hat.

                           in Hollywood, he came east to become a staff photographer for “Stage.” Mr. Valente
                           may be termed a photographic purist, inasmuch as he uses few of the usual “tricks”
                           of camera work.

                           salt bed was so bright that it exceeded the range of the Weston Exposure meter. Worried
                           by the heat, Mr. Curtiss made arrangements with a tavern in Windover, Utah, ten miles
                           away, to keep his film in the refrigerators there. However, of the fifty-four shots
                           taken, all but three were usable. Taking no chances, “Curt” took two shots of each
                           subject, but when interviewed by this scribe he declared them “unnecessary, for I
                           believe color can be handled as easily and efficiently as black and white.” The films
                           Kodachrome daylight, were rushed by airmail to the Eastman laboratories in Rochester,

                           Philadelphia. There are ninety-eight entries from all over the country, as well as
                           several prints by Sam J. Vogan from Ontario, Canada.

                        <p id="d13883e1302">The Miniature Camera Club of Philadelphia is one of the largest and most active in
                           the world. It was started about five years ago by less than twenty persons; today
                           its membership comprises some two hundred people from various professions. One of
                           the most unusual features about this organization is that it not only sponsors its
                           own salon, but also holds a salon for women.

                           year of its life—are being exhibited by the Photographic Society of Philadelphia,
                           oldest camera club in America, second oldest in the world, in celebration of its seventy-fifth
                           anniversary.

                           <date id="d13883e1331" when="1862-11">November, 1862</date>, a meeting was called by Coleman Sellers, Constant Guillou, Professors Fairman Rogers
                           and Edwin Emerson, Francis Fassit, Dickinson Sergent, S. Fisher Corlies and Eugene
                           Borda, all prominent Philadelphia camera fans. Elected first president of the society
                           was Constant Guillou, who two years before had issued a circular letter to amateur
                           photographers, urging the formation of “an association whose reunions would be agreeable
                           and beneficial.”

                        <p id="d13883e1335">Due to improvement through photographic research, much of it by members of the society,
                           many Philadelphia painters were intrigued by this new medium of expression, and a
                           salon was held at the Academy of the Fine Arts, the first in the world entirely devoted
                           to camera pictorialists. That salon, copied internationally, dates the birth of many
                           camera clubs and the popularity of photography as a hobby.

                        <p id="d13883e1339">Each year it is the custom of the society to place one print from its annual exhibition,
                           held at the society’s headquarters at 1615 Sansom Street, in the permanent exhibition.
                           “Curves,” by Manning P. Brown, gained the coveted honor for 1937. Others of the society’s
                           widely known salon pictorialists include A. R. Hallowell, Edward W. Quigley, Lewis

                        <p id="d13883e1503">Apropos of the Barnes vs. Museum controversy, let us presume that Barnes’ “Bathers”
                           is worth $150,000 and that the Museum’s “Bathers” is only worth $75,000. The Museum’s
                           painting will still be worth more than the Barnes’ to the people of Philadelphia for
                           the simple reason that anyone interested enough may see it as often as he wants. While
                           even students who have studied at the Barnes Foundation as many as three years, (speaking
                           from experience) are refused admittance to the gallery by being handed a printed slip
                           of paper saying that it is not a public gallery.

                           painters in Philadelphia, why should he resent their having second best to look at?

                        <p id="d13883e1585">Art students commonly use cheap, inferior, and non-permanent pigments on the premise
                           that they are “learning how to paint,” and that they don’t care what means they use
                           to attain this end. Too often, bad habits are formed which persist far into their
                           better years. We know a number of good painters who insist on using bad paint combinations,
                           no matter what! This indicates that it would be better to learn to appreciate good
                           craftsmanship in the beginning and to perfect it constantly in professional practice.
                           Much time would be saved for conscientious painters were this phase of instruction
                           to be emphasized in art schools.

                           <p id="d13883e1753">If the following statements seem a bit radical to you, perhaps they are so because
                              you haven’t thought of them in this light, or if you have, you haven’t bombarded your
                              administrative staff or board sufficiently with them to make them aware of these facts.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1756">To begin with, let us consider this age old cry of “fundamentals.” I’m not sure at
                              the present time just where we stand in the educational world about them. At one time
                              in my schooling I learned “plain” fundamentals. I laid flat washes; I rendered a bit
                              of drapery in pen and ink, to learn the medium; or I made a dovetail joint or a lap
                              joint, just that, to learn how to make one. There was no application of these principles.
                              We’ve come a long way since then, I hope. In most of the schools I’ve contact with,
                              some application is made along with technique, but not enough. Now don’t get me wrong.
                              I’ll always affirm that technique is paramount in the equipment of the artist, but
                              to waste the formative years of a pupil’s life in a continued harping on it to very
                              little end is just foolish.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1759">My friends and acquaintances who teach in the professional art schools have said,
                              to a man, “Send us, for goodness sake, people with ideas; we’ll teach them technique.
                              That’s what we are for.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1762">Now let’s take the above for a starting point and build our “curriculum” around that.
                              The conclusion is simple enough to write, but in application I’ll warn you that headaches
                              and heartaches are in store. But what an end, and what a reward to look forward to.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1766">It’s September and we’re meeting our assignments for the first time. Those that have
                              come up to us from the Junior School or the grades in our own system are easy; each
                              one has a folder of his work, and his accumulative record cards in the office offer
                              a very complete dossier of his interests, abilities, accomplishments and also that
                              very important thing, his home background. We can start where his other teachers left
                              off, or perhaps we’ve had contact with him before if our system allows a fully integrated
                              program. We’ll have this hypothetical boy for three years. It’s up to us to foster
                              each interest and idea that comes to him. We’ll have to simulate interest at times.
                              Remember his interests aren’t ours, and our sophistication isn’t his. That boy’s interest
                              is his curriculum and his accomplishment depends on two things, his own ability and
                              our ability in furthering his interest. They won’t all be shining lights and a glorious
                              ornament to the department, but they will have achieved upon graduation a fuller experience
                              in the field of fine arts.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1769">Now to come back to the new pupil from another system, where unfortunately they haven’t
                              the record card system. There’s the conference, preferably out of school, a walk,
                              a meal, a talk about anything and everything, the pretext to see how far advanced
                              he is; the intelligence and placement tests by the school research executives; then
                              with this data, we can proceed logically, letting him build his own course of study
                              to fit his own needs and desires.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e1772">I can see figurative smirks on a lot of faces when this is read, but this system can
                              work, it does work, proof can be offered if needed. But to return; it is my contention
                              that all the fundamentals needed and all the technique required can be taught by the
                              teacher, clearly and concisely, while the pupil is furthering his own interests. All
                              this means work and a lot of it on the teacher’s part, but all the records to be kept,
                              the necessary change of viewpoint as each new problem is presented, the keeping abreast
                              of innumerable subjects (you’ll be surprised by the catholicity of interests), all
                              have their compensations when an old pupil returns and tells you that he’s won a prize
                              or has sold something or has gotten a new job, because he had a new idea; or one not
                              in the art field still keeps up his interest in some phase of the work avocationally
                              because he was able to see for himself that the beginning and ending of art was not
                              for him one year laboriously spent in rendering a column, nay, only a segment of its

                        <p id="d13883e1873">With Xmas practically here, and with the annual problem of the gifts to our artistic
                           friends and what to give that budding young genius of a nephew (he paints too!) still
                           unsolved, along comes one of our local shops offering a superb and simple solution—a
                           gift order. A gift order ranging from one to twenty-five dollars that is good over
                           a period of time, that can be used to purchase sets or individual items, appeals to
                           us. We expect to add years to our life this Xmas by dodging hours of frantic and generally
                           futile search for just the right thing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1876">However, for the optimistic and energetic, we list here a number of items gleaned
                           from our browsing in local art supply shops.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1879">What would be more practical, simple or useful than a goodly supply of pencils. It
                           is here too, that we finally discovered a benefit derived from the depression and
                           Foreign Situation. It seems that our large domestic companies were too busy with their
                           regular lines before depression to bother with the artist’s needs. We had to be content
                           with Gillott pens from England, Kohinoor and Catell pencils from Germany and Austria.
                           Now the picture has changed. E Faber has brought out Carbon and Sanguine pencils and
                           sticks, comparable, if not superior to Wolf or Conte. Their Nu Pastels are available
                           in thirty-six colors, and compare favorably with German Faber Polycromos.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1882">Pen assortments by Esterbrook, Hunt, Spencerian, ranging from twenty-five cents to
                           a dollar have surprised many artists used to foreign pen points. But best of all,
                           the domestic products are invariably cheaper.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1886">Then there’s that attractive little model, Norma, (a mechanical pencil) that writes
                           four colors (one at a time of course) at the flick of a thumb. But there is also a
                           pencil selling for only fifteen cents that still has us slightly dazed. This paragon
                           not only writes four colors separately but four colors at once. We swear we weren’t
                           cocktailing and that we actually saw it work. Four at a time or separately, ladies
                           and gentlemen; you pays your money and you takes your choice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1889">For that young hopeful, why not start him out on a profitable career with the Enright
                           Engraver (we nearly succumbed ourself). This has been designed by a practical Philadelphia
                           jewelry engraver as a toy, but is as professional a toy as we’ve ever seen. It consists
                           of an Engraver’s Block, Plate holder, Engraving plates of varied colored catalin,
                           and a firmly tempered Steel Engraver’s Tool. We suggest that the family silver be
                           put out of the reach of the embryonic engraver, however.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1892">If you share our tendency toward procrastination and find that the sketch for a Christmas
                           card, done last July, is still not on a block, you’d better waltz right in and see
                           the new white surface Linoleum Blocks. These eliminate drawing in reverse, will take
                           transfers from newspapers, magazines, etc. by a Decora transfer solution, are very
                           hard, and will convey minute cutting with clean sharp edges. These come in sizes 1"
                           x 1" to 9" x 12", and are surprisingly inexpensive. There are also fine Aquaprint
                           Inks, Oils, Inking Rollers, Tools, Presses, Matched Paper and Envelopes, in fact everything
                           to make the usually painful operation simple.

                        <p id="d13883e1895">Finally, after years of saving old razor blades, ruining mats, and cutting fingers,
                           we bought us a real knife for a dollar. “Keen as a surgeon’s scalpel—safer—faster—and
                           easier to use,” the salesman told us, and he was right. These miracles come in five
                           types of holder and you have a choice of twelve different blades.

                        <p id="d13883e1898">Our old friend Pyrography creeps up on us again. This time with the fancy name of
                           Electric Color Burning.

                        <p id="d13883e1901">The “Magic Stylus” a “midget in size, a giant for work” is only a dollar and a quarter.
                           It can also be obtained in sets complete with stylus, water colors, woods, etc. There
                           are hundreds of novelties to be made as gifts, as well as signs, decorative schemes,
                           etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e1905">Speaking of signs, we have discovered a lettering device, that’s almost disgustingly
                           simple. It consists of a Wrico lettering guide and a special pen. The largest set
                           has five different pens and eight types of guides. It is the simplest and most effective
                           means of doing window cards, architectural lettering, etc. we have ever seen.

                        <p id="d13883e1908">At long last, however, we offer a suggestion on a par with our gift order. Perhaps,
                           like us, you have no desire to stain your fingers block printing or burn them with
                           pyrography; then be sure to see the exceptionally fine imported cards, twenty for
                           a dollar, that can be had at the art supply shops.

                           was ordered painted out from the walls of the Children’s Tuberculosis Sanitarium.
                           District of Columbia’s health commissioner, Dr. George C. Ruhland, thought it “grotesque”
                           and “unsuitable,” no doubt because of its modern treatment. W. P. A. artists protested
                           and won for the mural a fair trial, by a jury of five children picked at random from
                           Washington schools, aged ten and eleven. The verdict was “not guilty” and the painting
                           remains, to gladden young eyes and irk those of the disapproving adults.

                           during the class period. Students liked the painting so well that they bought it for

                           personalities and places, made during her numerous trips in England, Europe, and Northern
                           Africa. Miss Emerson who has just illustrated a book on India, will also exhibit travel
                           sketches.

                           be the last of this season’s series of Cogslea Lectures. The first four were given

                        <p id="d13883e2026">Discussing the trend of modern water colors from lively sparkling treatments to the
                           weighty, dark arrangements that dominate this year’s Academy show, Miss S. Gertrude
                           Schell gave an informative gallery talk at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts,
                           
                           <date id="d13883e2028" when="--11-24">November 24</date>.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2032">According to Miss Schell, the broad, rugged comprehensiveness, the richness and depth
                           of color, that characterize so many of this year’s water colors, produces a strength
                           and vitality that gives them the qualities of oil. Outstanding among them, she believed,
                           were the group by O’Hara, whom she termed “a master of water color.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2035">Miss Schell considered the two paintings by Carter Schwitzer to be among the most
                           artistic efforts of the exhibition. “Pale, yet their exquisite opalescent quality
                           makes them as strong, in their own way, as the work of Presser.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2038">She also discussed at some length the works of Albert Guld, a first year exhibitor,
                           and of Andrew Wyeth, both for their general excellence at present and the “amazing
                           potentialities” of these newcomers to the field.

                        <p id="d13883e2064">It is most unfortunate that there should be so many “phoney” art books on the market
                           today. Such is the case, however, and it behooves all those interested in building
                           an art library to tread most carefully indeed. Dilettantes, Pedagogues and other so-called
                           “experts” are flooding the book market with “authoritative” volumes on subjects concerning
                           which they have no understanding. It is one thing to read biographies and rehash them
                           verbosely, and quite another to write concerning that of which one really has some
                           actual knowledge. The average art biography, as we know it today, has very little
                           to do with art appreciation or knowledge of aesthetics.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2067">If we may presume to offer advice as to the best possible way to avoid being taken
                           in by this kind of swindle, it would be simply this:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2070">Read fewer books about artists’ lives and loves, more concerning themselves with analytical
                           studies of their work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2074">Believe about ten per cent of the opinion you read and be wary about accepting authorities.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2077">Buy books containing reading matter, not “picture books.” Reproductions of paintings
                           are important, it is true, but generally give but a poor idea of the actual work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2080">Forgive our seeming conceit in “advising” you, but the art world has been so full
                           recently of spurious “art books” that we simply had to get this off our literary chest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d13883e2083">A biography that is really, in our humble opinion, of real merit is “The Life of Paul
                           Gauguin” by Robert Burnett, published by the Oxford University Press. Interestingly
                           written, it does much more than paint a poster of a lurid life. Cause and effect join
                           hands here, and a fine analytical study of the painter’s life that shows quite clearly
                           the “why” of his pictures is the happy result.

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e2168">While functional decorative lighting in certain forms is a very interesting and intriguing
                              display technique it does have definite limitations.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e2172">It is most effective on the shady side of the street, because only there will its
                              subtle quality be fully apparent. On the sunny side the strong reflection on the glass
                              minimizes the effect, often resulting in an irritating gloom.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e2175">On the sunny side it is almost necessary to literally flood the window with light
                              to counteract to some degree the strong glare outside. This does not mean interesting
                              lighting effects cannot be obtained, but does mean definitely that the volume of light
                              in the window must approach the volume of light outside. Of course, theoretically,
                              one cannot produce light comparable to daylight, but we must approach it or the glass
                              becomes a mirror and merchandise or message is barely discernible.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e2178">Many decorative lighting effects are of course wholly effective at night, no matter
                              what the store location might be, but then, as night traffic is thin in certain locations,
                              the appeal of the window must be to the greatest number (that is day traffic in such
                              cases) if the results are to justify display expense.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d13883e2181">A simile—To use certain pale gray tones rather than black in printing your column
                              might be highly attractive and artistic, but would cause eye strain and a loss in
                              reader volume, and be quickly abandoned, I believe, as the effectiveness of your message

                              urgent appeal and invitation to display men of Philadelphia to send us letters—articles—news
                              of like calibre. We feel that such a column could be a clearing house of infinite
                              value to the display field.

                           <p id="d13883e2206">We greatly admire the man who finally decided Xmas feeling could be had without resorting
                              to red and green—reindeer—or candles We’ve always been soft on Reina Rosenthal angels,
                              and Bonwit’s couldn’t have pleased us more than with their border adaptation. The
                              horses as foretold here last week are by Weinberg across the street and are really
                              something!

                              portray the Xmas feeling in a modern manner.
