                           <p id="d7161e484">I was on the point of leaving India and returning to England when he sent for me.
                              At least, to be
                              accurate—and I am always accurate—I was not quite on the point, but nearly, for I
                              was going to
                              start by the mail on the following day. I had been up to Government House to take
                              my leave a few
                              days before, but Sir John had been too ill to see me, or at least he had said he was.
                              And now he
                              was much worse—dying, it seemed, from all accounts; and he had sent down a native
                              servant in the
                              noonday heat with a note, written in his shaky old hand, begging <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span> me to come up as soon as it became cooler. He said he had a commission which he was
                              anxious I
                              should do for him in England.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p id="d7161e489">Of course I went. It was not very convenient, because I had to borrow one of our fellows'
                              traps,
                              as I had sold my own, and none of them had the confidence in my driving which I had
                              myself. I
                              was also obliged to leave the packing of my collection of Malay

                           <p id="d7161e499">I wondered as I drove along why Sir John had sent for me. Worse, was he ? Dying ?
                              And without a
                              friend. Poor old man! He had done pretty well in this world, but I was afraid he would
                              not be up
                              to much once he was out of it; and now it seemed he was going. I felt sorry for him.
                              I felt more
                              sorry when I saw him—when the tall, long— faced A.D.C. took me into his rogm and left
                              us. Yes,
                              Sir John was certainly going. There was no mistake about it. It was written in every
                              line of his
                              drawn fever-worn <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="3"> </a></span>face, and in his wide fever-lit eyes, and in
                              the clutch of his long yellow hands upon his tussore silk dressing-gown. He'looked
                              a very sick,
                              bad old man as he lay there on his low couch, placed so as to court the air from without,
                              cooled
                              by its passage through damped grass screens, and to receive the full strength of the
                              punkah,
                              pulled by an invisible hand outside.

                              more—something sympathetic about his being ill and not likely to get better ; but
                              he had always
                              treated me discourteously when he was well, and I could not open out all at once now
                              that he was

                           <p id="d7161e670">As I breakfasted next morning previously to my departure, I could not help reflecting
                              on the
                              different position in which I was now returning to England, as a Colonel on long leave,
                              to that
                              in which I had left it many—I do not care to think how many—years ago, the youngest
                              ensign in
                              the regiment.

                           <p id="d7161e673">It was curious to remember that in my youth I had always been considered the fool
                              of the family;
                              most unjustly so considered, when I look back at my quick promotion, owing to casualties,
                              and at
                              my long and prosperous career in India, which I cannot but regard as the result of
                              high
                              principles and abilities, to say the least of it,. of not the meanest order. On the
                              point of
                              returning to England, the trust Sir John had with his usual shrewdness reposed in
                              me was an
                              additional proof, if proof were needed, of the confidence I had inspired in him—a
                              confidence
                              which seemed to have ripened suddenly at the end of his life, after many years of
                              hardly
                              concealed mockery and derision. Just <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="11"> </a></span>as I was finishing my

                                 and a figure rush out through the veranda. The moon was bright, and he saw a man run

                              it was getting late, and there was a bustle and a leave-taking, and I had to post
                              off before I
                              could hear more. Not, however, that there was much more to hear, for everything seemed
                              to be in
                              the greatest confusion, and every species of conjecture was afloat as to the real
                              criminal, and
                              the motive for the crime. I had not much time to think of anything during the first
                              day on
                              board; yet, busy as I was in arranging and re-arranging my things, poor old Sir John
                              never
                              seemed quite absent from my mind. His image, as I had last seen him, constantly rose
                              before me,
                              and the hoarse whisper was for ever sounding in my ears, 'I'm watched! I know I'm

                              first night I was on board, and as the long hours wore on I always seemed to see the
                              pale,
                              searching eyes of the dead man; and above the manifold noises of the steamer and the

                              meant before, because no two women I ever met seemed to have the same kind. If it
                              is slamming a
                              door that upsets one woman's nerves, it may be coming in on tiptoe that will upset
                              another's.
                              You never can tell. But I am sure it was nerves with me that first night; I know I
                              have never
                              felt so queer since. Oh yes, I have, though—once! I was forgetting; but I have not
                              come to that

                              seeing England again, and even the children were not so troublesome as I have known
                              them. I soon
                              made friends <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span>with some of the nicest people, for I generally
                              make friends easily. I do not know how I do it, but I always seem to know what people
                              really are
                              at first sight. I always was rather a judge of character.

                           <p id="d7161e769">There was one man on board whom I took a great fancy to from the first. He was a young
                              American,
                              travelling about, as Americans do, to see the world. I forget where he had come from—though
                              I
                              believe he told me—or why he was going to London; but a nicer young fellow I never
                              met. He was
                              rather simple and unsophisticated, and with less knowledge of the world than any man
                              I ever
                              knew; but he did not mind owning to it, and was as grateful as possible for any little
                              hints
                              which, as an older man who had not gone through life with his eyes shut, I was of
                              course able to
                              give him. He was of a shy disposition, I could see, and wanted drawing out; but he
                              soon took to
                              me, and in a surprisingly short time we became friends. He was in the next cabin to
                              mine, and
                              evidently <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="17"> </a></span> wished so much to have been with me that I tried to
                              get another man to exchange; but he was grumpy about it, and I had to give it up,
                              much to young
                              Carr's disappointment. Indeed, he was quite silent and morose for a whole day about
                              it, poor
                              fellow. He was a tall, handsome young man, slightly built, with the kind of sallow
                              complexion
                              that women admire, and I wondered at his preferring my company to that of the womankind

                              board, who were certainly very civil to him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e775">One evening when I was rallying him on the subject, as we were leaning over the side
                              (for, though
                              it was December, it was hot enough in the Red Sea to lounge on deck), he told me that
                              he was
                              engaged to be married to a beautiful young American girl. I forget her name, but I
                              remember he
                              told it me— Dulcima Something—but it is of no consequence. I quite understood then.
                              I always can
                              enter into the feelings of others so entirely. I know when I was engaged myself once,
                              long ago,
                              I did not seem to care <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span>to talk to anyone but her. She did not
                              feel the same about it, which, perhaps, accounted for her marrying someone else, which
                              was quite
                              a blow to me at the time. But still, I could fully enter into young Carr's feelings,
                              especially
                              when he went on to expatiate on her perfections. Nothing, he averred, was too good
                              for her. At
                              last he dropped his voice, and after looking about him in the dusk to make sure he
                              was not
                              overheard, he said :

                              <said id="d7161e955" who="#colonel">But you got over it in a moment</said>,' I replied. '
                              <said id="d7161e958" who="#colonel">I
                                 quite admired you; and, after all, you know—some other time

                           </p>

                              <said id="d7161e964" who="#carr">No</said>,' he said, smiling still, ' 
                              <said id="d7161e967" who="#carr">not some other time. I
                                 don't think I will see them—thanks all the same. They might put me out of conceit
                                 with what
                                 I have picked up for my little girl, which are the best I can afford

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e972">He seemed to have lost all interest in the subject, for he began to talk of England
                              and of
                              London, about which he appeared to have that kind of vague half-and-half knowledge
                              which so
                              often proves misleading to young men newly launched into town life. When he found
                              out, as he
                              soon did, that I was to a certain extent familiar with the Metropolis, he began to
                              question me
                              minutely, and ended by making me promise to dine with him at <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span>
                              the Criterion, of which he had actually never heard, and go with him afterwards to
                              the best of
                              the theatres the day after we arrived in London.

                           <p id="d7161e977">He wanted me to go with him the very evening we arrived, but on that point I was firm.
                              My sister
                              Jane, who was living with a hen canary (called Bob, after me, before its sex was known)
                              in a
                              small house in Kensington, would naturally be hurt if I did not spend my first evening
                              in
                              England with her, after an absence of so many years.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e980">Carr was much interested to hear that I had a sister, and asked innumerable questions
                              about her.
                              Was she young and lovely, or was she getting on? Did she live all by herself, and
                              was I going to
                              stay with her for long? Was not Kensington—was that the name of the street ?—rather
                              out of the
                              world ? etc.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e983">I was pleased with the interest he took in any particulars about myself and my relations.
                              People
                              so seldom care to hear about the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="25"> </a></span> concerns of others. Indeed, I
                              have noticed, as I advance in life, such a general want of interest on the part of
                              my
                              acquaintance in the minutiae of my personal affairs, that of late I have almost ceased
                              to speak
                              of them at any length. Carr, however, who was of what I should call a truly domestic
                              turn of
                              character, showed such genuine pleasure in hearing about myself and my relations,
                              that I asked
                              him to call in London in order to make Jane's acquaintance, and accordingly gave him
                              her
                              address, which he took down at once in his note-book with evident satisfaction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e988">Our passage was long, but it proved most uneventful; and except for an occasional
                              dance, and the
                              theatricals before mentioned, it would have been dull in the extreme. The theatricals
                              certainly
                              were a great success, mainly owing to the splendid acting of young Carr, who became
                              afterwards a
                              more special object of favour even than he was before. It was bitterly cold when we
                              landed early
                              in January at Southampton, and my native land <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="36" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span> seemed to have
                              retired from view behind a thick veil of fog. We had a wretched journey up to London,
                              packed as
                              tight as sardines in a tin, much to the disgust of Carr, who accompanied me to town,
                              and who,
                              with his usual thoughtfulness, had in vain endeavoured to keep the carriage to ourselves,
                              by
                              liberal tips to guards and porters. When we at last arrived in London, he insisted
                              on getting me
                              a cab and seeing my luggage on to it, before he looked after his own at all. It was
                              only when I
                              had given the cabman my sister's address that he finally took his leave and disappeared
                              among
                              the throng of people who were jostling each other near the luggage-vans.

                           <p id="d7161e993">Curiously enough when I arrived at my destination an odd thing happened. I got out
                              at the green
                              door of 23, Suburban Residences, and when the maid opened it walked straight past
                              her into the
                              little drawing-room.

                              <said id="d7161e999" who="#colonel">Well, Jane</said> !' I cried.

                           <p id="d7161e1005">A pale, middle-aged woman rose as I came in, and I stood aghast. It was not my sister.
                              It was
                              soon explained. She was a little pettish about it, poor woman. It seemed my sister
                              had quite
                              recently changed her house, and the present occupant had been put to some slight inconvenience
                              before by people calling and leaving parcels after her departure. She gave me Jane's
                              new
                              address, which was only in the next street, and I apologized and made my bow at once.
                              My going
                              to the wrong house was such a slight occurrence that I almost forgot it at the time,
                              until I was
                              reminded of it by a very sad event which happened afterwards.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e1008">Jane was delighted to see me. It seemed she had written to inform me of her change
                              of address,
                              but the letter did not reach me before I started for England with the Danvers Jewels,
                              about
                              which I have been asked to write this account. Considering this is an account of the
                              jewels, it
                              is wonderful how seldom I have had occasion <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="28"> </a></span>to mention them so
                              far; but you may rest assured that all this time they were safe in their bag under
                              my waistcoat;
                              and knowing I had them there all right, I did not trouble my head much about them.
                              I never was a
                              person to worry about things.

                           <p id="d7161e1013">Still, I had no wish to be inconvenienced by a hard packet of little knobs against
                              my chest any
                              longer than was necessary, and I wrote the same evening to Sir George Danvers, stating
                              the bare
                              facts of the case, and asking what steps he or his second son wished me to take to
                              put the
                              legacy in the possession of its owner. I had no notion of trusting a packet of such
                              immense
                              value to the newly-organized Parcels Post. With jewels I consider you cannot be too
                              cautious;
                              indeed, I told Jane so at the time, and she quite agreed with me.

                              The way
                              the two bedrooms, hers and mine, were shut off from the rest of the house by a door,
                              barred
                              and locked at -night for fear of burglars, was, I thought, unpleasant, especially
                              as, once
                              in my room for the night, there was no possibility of getting out of it, the key of
                              the door
                              of the passage not being even allowed to remain in the lock, but retiring with Jane,
                              the
                              canary cage, and other valuables, into her own apartment. I remonstrated, but I soon
                              found
                              that Jane had not remained unmarried for nothing. She was decided on the point. The
                              outer
                              door would be locked as usual, and the key would <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span>be
                              deposited under the pin-cushion in her room as usual; and it was so.

                           <p id="d7161e1030">The next morning, as Jane and I went out for a stroll before luncheon, we had to pass
                              the
                              house to which I had driven by mistake the day before. To our astonishment, there
                              was a
                              crowd before the door, and a policeman with his back to it was guarding the entrance.
                              The
                              blinds were all drawn down. The image of the pale, lonely woman sitting by her little

                              whom I had disturbed the day before came suddenly back to me with a strange qualm.

                              at an area railing, rubbing his chin against the loaf he was waiting to deliver. The

                              was to know. The poor lady had not been murdered, it seemed, but, being subject to
                              heart
                              complaint, had died in the night of an acute attack, evidently brought on by fright.
                              The
                              maid, the only other person in the house, sleeping as maids-of all-work only can,

                              nothing, and awoke in the morning to find her mistress dead in her bed, with the window
                              and
                              door open. Strangely enough, the policeman added, although nothing in the house had
                              been
                              touched, the lock of an unused bedroom had been forced, and the room evidently searched.

                              had evinced the greatest interest the night before, and, greatly to her delight, showed
                              her
                              the jewels. I had not looked at them since Sir John had given them to me, and I was
                              myself
                              astonished at their magnificence as I spread them out on the table under the gas-lamp.

                              exhausted herself in admiration; but as I was putting them away again, saying it was
                              time
                              for me to be dressing and going to meet Carr, who was to join me at the Criterion,
                              she
                              begged me on no account to take them with me, affirming that it would be much safer
                              to leave
                              them at home. I was firm, but she was firmer; and in the end I allowed her to lock
                              them up
                              in the tea-caddy, where her small stock of ready-money reposed.

                              had seen
                              the papers, had hardly expected that I should turn up, knowing the catastrophe of
                              the
                              previous night had taken place at the house I was going to, and was much relieved
                              to hear
                              that my sister had moved, and had thus been spared all the horror of the event.

                           <p id="d7161e1077">The dinner was good, the play better. I should have come home feeling that I had enjoyed
                              myself thoroughly, if it had not been for a little adventure with our cab-driver that
                              very
                              nearly proved serious. We got a hansom directly we came out of the theatre, but instead
                              of
                              taking us to the direction we gave him, after we had driven for some distance I began
                              to
                              make out that the cabman was going wrong, and Carr shouted to him to stop; but thereupon
                              he
                              lashed up his horse, and away we went like the winds, up one street, and down another,
                              till
                              I had ~kst all idea where we were. Carr, who was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="44" data-tei-n="34"> </a></span>young and
                              active, did all he could; but the cabman, who, I am afraid, must have been intoxicated,
                              took
                              not the slightest notice, and continued driving madly, Heaven knows where.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e1082">At last, after getting into a very dingy neighbourhood, we turned up a crooked dark
                              street
                              unlit by any lamp—a street so narrow that I thought every moment the cab would be
                              overturned. In another moment I saw two men rush out of a doorway. One seized the
                              horse,
                              which was much blown by this time, and brought it violently to a standstill, while
                              the other
                              flew at the cab, and, catching Carr by the collar, proceeded to drag him out by main
                              force.
                              I suppose Carr did his best, but, being only an American, he certainly made a very
                              poor
                              fight of it; and while I was laying into the man who had got hold of him, I was suddenly
                              caught by the legs myself from the other side of the cab. I turned on my assailant,
                              saw a
                              heavy stick levelled at me, caught at <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="45" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>it, missed it, beheld
                              a series of fireworks, and remembered nothing more.

                           <p id="d7161e1087">The first thing I heard on beginning to come to myself was a series of subdued but
                              evidently
                              heartfelt oaths ; and I became sensible of an airy feeling, unpleasant in the extreme,
                              proceeding from an open condition of coat and waistcoat quite unsuited to the time
                              of year.
                              A low chorus of muffled whispering was going on round me. As I groaned involuntarily
                              it
                              stopped.

                              <said id="d7161e1096" who="#carr">Go and fetch
                                 some brandy

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e1100">And I felt myself turned right side upper-most, and my hands were rubbed, while Carr,
                              in a
                              voice of the greatest anxiety, asked me how I felt. I was soon able to sit up, and
                              to become
                              aware that I had a splitting headache, and was staring at a tallow candle stuck in
                              a bottle.
                              Having got so far, I got a little further, and on looking round found myself reclining
                              on a
                              sack in a corner of a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="46" data-tei-n="36"> </a></span> disreputable-looking room, dingy
                              with dirt, and faithful to the memory of bad tobacco. Then I suddenly remembered what
                              had
                              occurred. Carr saw that I did so, and instantly poured forth an account of how we
                              had been
                              rescued from a condition of great peril by the man to whom the house we were in belonged,
                              to
                              whom he hardly knew how to express his gratitude, and who was now gone for some brandy
                              for
                              me. He told me a great deal about it, but I was so dizzy that I forget most of what
                              he said,
                              and it was not until our deliverer returned with the brandy that I became thoroughly
                              aware
                              of what was going forward. I could not help thinking, as I thanked the honest fellow
                              who had
                              come to our assistance, how easily one may be deceived by appearances, for a more
                              forbidding-looking face under its fur cap I never saw. That of his son, who presently
                              returned with a four-wheeler which Carr had sent for, was not more prepossessing.
                              In fact,
                              they were two as villainous-looking men <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="47" data-tei-n="37"> </a></span>as I had ever seen.
                              After recompensing both with' all our spare cash, we got ourselves hoisted stiffly
                              into the
                              cab, and Carr good-naturedly insisted on seeing me home, though he owned to feeling,
                              as he
                              put it, 'rather knocked up by his knocking down.' We were both far too exhausted to
                              speak
                              much, until Carr gave a start and a gasp, and said, '

                              it was
                              only natural. I parted from him at my own door, and was glad on going in to find Jane

                              stayed up for me. I soon figured in her eyes as the hero of a thrilling adventure,
                              while her

                              it? Our house
                              was broken into that very night. Nothing serious came of it, wonderful to relate,
                              owing to
                              Jane's extraordinary presence of mind. She had been unable to sleep after my thrilling
                              account
                              of the cab accident, and had consoled herself by reading Baxter's 'Saint's Rest' by
                              her
                              night-light, for the canary became restless and liable to sudden bursts of song if
                              a candle were
                              lighted. While so engaged she became aware of a subdued grating sound, which had continued
                              for
                              some time before she began to speculate upon it. While she was speculating it ceased,
                              and after
                              a short interval she distinctly heard a stealthy step upon the stair, and the handle
                              <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="50" data-tei-n="40"> </a></span>of the passage door before mentioned was gently, very gently,
                              turned.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e1175">Jane has some of that quickness of perception which has been of such use to myself
                              through life.
                              In a moment she had grasped the situation. Someone was in the house. In another moment
                              she was
                              hanging out of her bedroom window, springing the policeman's rattle which she had
                              had by her for
                              years with a view to an emergency of this kind, and at the same time—for she was a
                              capable
                              woman—blowing a piercing strain on a cabman's whistle.

                              eyes she saw two dark figures fly up our area steps and disappear round the corner,
                              and when a
                              policeman appeared on the scene, half an hour later, he confirmed the fact that the
                              house had
                              been broken into by showing us how an entrance had been effected through the kitchen
                              window.

                              passed by Jane
                              in examining the house from top to bottom every half-hour or so, owing to a rooted
                              conviction on
                              her part that a burglar might still be lurking on the premises, concealed in the cellarette,
                              or
                              the jam cupboard, or behind the drawing-room curtains.

                           <p id="d7161e1187">By that morning's post I heard, as I expected I should do, from Sir George Danvers,
                              but the
                              contents of the letter surprised me. He wrote most cordially, thanking me for my kindness
                              in
                              undertaking such a heavy responsibility (I am sure I never felt it to be so) for an
                              entire
                              stranger, and ended by sending me a pressing invitation to come down to Stoke Moreton
                              that very
                              day, that he and his son, whose future wife was also staying with them, might have
                              the pleasure
                              of making the acquaintance of one to whom they were so much indebted. He added that
                              his eldest
                              son Charles was also going down from London by a certain train that <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="52" data-tei-n="42"> </a></span>day, and that he had told him to be on the look-out for me at the
                              station in case I was able to come at such short notice. I made up my mind to go,
                              sent Sir
                              George a telegram to that effect, and proceeded to fish up the jewels out of the tea-caddy.

                              and
                              continued insisting, that they had been exposed to great danger. I argued the matter

                              first; but women, I find, are impervious as a rule to masculine argument, and it is
                              a mistake to
                              reason with them. It is, in fact, putting the sexes for the moment <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="53" data-tei-n="43"> </a></span>on an equality to which the weaker one is unaccustomed, and

                              up the
                              straight wide approach between two rows of ancient, fantastically-clipped hollies,
                              I was
                              impressed by the stately dignity of the place, which was not lessened as we drew up
                              before a
                              great arched doorway, and were ushered into a long hall supported by massive pillars
                              of carved
                              white stone. A roaring log fire in the immense fireplace threw a ruddy glow over the
                              long array
                              of armour and gleaming weapons which lined the walls, and made the pale winter twilight
                              outside
                              look bleak indeed. Charles, emerging slim and graceful out of an exquisite ulster,
                              sauntered up
                              to the fire and asked where Sir George Danvers was. As <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="59" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span>he stood
                              inside the wide fireplace, leaning against one of the pillars which supported the
                              towering white
                              stone chimneypiece covered with heraldic designs and coats of arms, he looked a worthier
                              representative of an ancient race than I fear he really was.

                              party into the midst of which we were now ushered. I soon made out Sir George Danvers,
                              a
                              delicate, but irascible-looking old gentleman, who received me with dignified cordiality,
                              but
                              returned Charles's greeting with a certain formality and cold- 4 <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="60" data-tei-n="50"> </a></span>ness which I was pained to see, family affection being in my opinion the chief blessing
                              of a
                              truly happy home. Charles I already knew, and with the second son, Ralph, a ruddy,
                              smiling young
                              man with any amount of white teeth, I had no difficulty; but after that I became hopelessly
                              involved. I was introduced to an elderly lady whom I addressed for the rest of the
                              evening as
                              Lady Danvers, until Charles casually mentioned that his mother was dead, and that
                              until the
                              Deceased Wife's Sister Bill was passed he did not anticipate that his aunt Mary would
                              take upon
                              herself the position of step-mother to her orphaned nephews. The severe elderly lady,
                              then, who
                              beamed so sweetly upon Ralph, and regarded Charles with such manifest coldness, was
                              their aunt,
                              Lady Mary Cunningham. She had known Sir John slightly in her youth, she said, as she
                              graciously
                              made room for me on her sofa, and she expressed a very proper degree of regret at
                              his sudden
                              death, considering <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="61" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span>that he had not been a personal friend in

                              present was the one to whom Ralph was engaged. I was undecided as to which it was

                              whom I had already been introduced. Girls always seem to me so very much alike, especially
                              pretty girls, and these were both of them pretty. I do not mean that they resembled
                              each other
                              in the least, for one was dark and one was fair; <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="62" data-tei-n="52"> </a></span>but which was
                              Miss Aurelia Grant, Ralph's fiance, and which was Miss Evelyn Derrick, a cousin of

                              could not make out until later in the evening, when I distinctly saw Ralph kiss the
                              fair one in
                              the picture-gallery, and I instantly came to the conclusion that she was the one to
                              whom he was
                              engaged.

                              having found it misleading in the extreme to draw any conclusion from it. He further
                              informed me
                              that Miss Derrick was the young lady with dark hair who had poured out tea, and whom
                              he had
                              favoured with some of his conversation afterwards.

                              and
                              dignified in manner, with a pale, refined face. She was pretty in a way, but not to
                              compare to
                              Aurelia. Evelyn had an anxious look about her, too. Now I do not approve of a girl
                              looking
                              grave; she ought to be bright and happy, with a smile for everyone. It is all very
                              well for us
                              men, who have the work of the world to do, to look grave at times, but with women
                              it is
                              different, and a woman always looks her best when she smiles—at least, I think so.

                              afterwards a

                              seemed well
                              informed. I had myself almost forgotten the reason of my taking any interest in my

                              the urgent request of all the ladies at once, Ralph begged me to bring them down to

                              admired then and there, before the rehearsal began.

                              invited to the paternal roof at all. Between the brothers, however, in spite of so

                              There is nothing I like so much as knowing a play beforehand, because then one can
                              always
                              whisper to one's companion what is coming next. The stage, with all its adjustments,
                              had been
                              carefully arranged, the foot-lights were lighted, the piece began. All went well till
                              nearly the
                              end of the first act, when there was a cry behind the scenes of 'Mr. Denis!' Mr. Denis
                              should
                              have rushed on, but Mr. Denis did not rush on. The play stopped. Mr. Denis was not
                              in the
                              library, the improvised green-room; Mr. Denis did not appear when his name was called
                              in
                              stentorian tones by Ralph, or in pathetic falsetto by Charles. In short, Mr. Denis
                              was not
                              forthcoming. A <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="74" data-tei-n="64"> </a></span> rush upstairs on the part of most of the young
                              men brought to light the awful fact that Mr. Denis had retired to his chamber, a prey
                              to sudden
                              and acute indisposition.

                              might be restored by the following morning.

                              Charles said, to smile over his beef-tea. Lady Mary, who appeared at luncheon time,

                              one of Lord Barrantyne's sons, or was he one of the Crampshire Carrs? She had known

                              She seemed surprised when I told her that Carr was an American, and he sank, I could
                              see, at
                              once in her estimation; but she was kind enough to say that she was not a person who
                              was
                              prejudiced in any way by a man's nationality, and that she believed that very respectable
                              people
                              might be found among the Americans.

                           <p id="d7161e2180">IT was nearly eight o'clock when I came down. The play was to begin at eight. The
                              hall, which was
                              brilliantly lighted, was one moving mass of black coats, with here and there a red
                              one, and
                              evening dresses many coloured, the people in them chatting, bowing, laughing, being
                              ushered to
                              their places. Lady Mary and Sir George Danvers side by side received their guests
                              at the foot of
                              the grand staircase, Lady Mary resplendent in diamond tiara and rivière, smiling as
                              if she could
                              never frown; Sir George upright, courteous, a trifle stiff, as most English country
                              gentlemen
                              feel it incumbent on themselves to be on such occasions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2183">Presently the continual roll of the carriages outside ceased, the lamps were toned
                              down, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span>the orchestra struck up, and Sir George and Lady Mary took
                              their seats, looking round with anxious satisfaction at the hall crowded with people.
                              People
                              lined the walls; chairs were being lifted over the heads of the sitting for some who
                              were still
                              standing; cushions were being arranged on the billiard-table at the back for a covey
                              of white
                              waistcoats who arrived late; the staircase was already crowded with servants; the
                              whole place
                              was crammed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2188">I wondered how they were getting on behind the scenes, and, slipping out of the hall,
                              I traversed
                              the great gold and white drawing-room, prepared for dancing, and peeped into the morning-room,
                              which, with the adjoining library, had been given up to the actors. They were all
                              assembled in
                              the morning-room, however, waiting for one of the elder ladies who had not come down.
                              The
                              prompter was getting fidgety, and walking about. The two scene-shifters—pale, weary-looking
                              men
                              who had come down with the scenery—were sitting in the wings, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="99" data-tei-n="89"> </a></span>perfectly apathetic amid the general excitement. Charles and several other actors
                              were
                              standing round a footman who was opening champagne bottles at a surprising rate. I
                              saw Charles
                              take a glass to Evelyn, who was shivering with a sharp attack of stage-fever in an
                              arm-chair,
                              looking over her part. She smiled gratefully, but as she did so her eyes wandered
                              to the other
                              side of the room, where Ralph, on his knees before Aurelia, was fastening a diamond
                              star in her
                              dress. Diamonds, rubies, and emeralds flashed in her hair and on her white neck and
                              arms. Ralph
                              was fixing the last ornament on to her shoulder with wire off a champagne bottle,
                              there being no
                              clasp to hold it in its place. I saw Evelyn turn away again, and Charles, who was
                              watching her,
                              suddenly went off to the fire, and began to complain of the cold and of the thinness
                              of his silk
                              stockings.

                           <p id="d7161e2194">The elder lady—' the heavy mother,' as Charles irreverently called her—now arrived
                              ; the
                              orchestra, which was giving a final <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="100" data-tei-n="90"> </a></span> flourish, was begged in a
                              hoarse whisper to keep going a few minutes longer; eyes were applied to the hole in
                              the curtain,
                              and then, everyone being assembled, it was felt by all that the awful moment had come
                              at last. A
                              more miserable-looking set of people I never saw. I always imagined that the actors
                              behind the
                              scenes were as gay off the stage as on it; but I found, to my astonishment, that they
                              were all
                              suffering more or less from severe mental depression. Ralph and Aurelia were now sitting
                              ruefully together on an ottoman beside the painting-table, littered with its various
                              rouges and
                              creams and stage appliances. Even Charles, who had established Evelyn on a chair in
                              the wings at
                              the side she had to come on from, and was now drinking champagne with due regard to
                              his
                              paint—even Charles owned to being nervous.

                              go jauntily forward. A moment more, and there was a thunder of applause. All the actors
                              looked
                              at each other, and smiled a feeble smile.

                              the dress of an old-fashioned livery servant, proceeded to mount the steps. It dawned
                              upon me
                              that I was missing the play, and I hurried back, to find Charles convulsing the audience
                              with
                              the utmost coolness, and evidently enjoying himself exceedingly. Then Evelyn came
                              on— But who
                              cares to read a description of a play ? It is sufficient to say that Aurelia looked
                              charming,
                              and many were the whispered comments on her magnificent jewels; but on the stage Evelyn
                              surpassed her, as much as Aurelia surpassed Evelyn off it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2222">Ralph and Carr did well, but Charles <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="102" data-tei-n="92"> </a></span>was the favourite with
                              everyone, from the Duchess of Crushington in the front seat to the scullery-maid on
                              the
                              staircase. He was so bold, so wicked, so insinuating, in his plumed cap and short
                              cloak, so
                              elegantly refined when he wiped his sword upon his second's handkerchief. He took
                              everyone's
                              heart by storm. Ralph, who represented all the virtues, with rather thick ankles and
                              a false
                              moustache, was nowhere. When the curtain fell for the last time, amid great and continued
                              applause, the 'heavy mother,' Ralph, Aurelia, all were well received as they passed
                              before it;
                              but Charles, who appeared last, was the hero of the evening.

                              in the intense
                              quiet and repose of the great house, after all the excitement of the last few hours,
                              that oppressed
                              me. Everything seemed, as I lay awake, so unnaturally silent. There was not a sound
                              in the wide
                              grate, where the last ashes of the fire were silently giving up the ghost, not a rumble
                              of wind in
                              the old chimney, which had had so much to say the night before. I tossed and turned,
                              and vainly
                              sought for sleep, now on this side, now on that. At last I gave up trying, half in
                              the hope that it
                              might steal upon me unawares. I thought of the play and the ball, of poor Charles
                              and his debts—of
                              anything and everything, but it was no good. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="117" data-tei-n="107"> </a></span>In the midst of a
                              jumble of disconnected ideas I suddenly found myself listening again to the silence,
                              listening as if
                              it had been broken by a sound which I had not heard. My watch ticked loud and louder
                              on the
                              dressing-table, and presently I gave quite a start as the distant stable clock tolled
                              out the
                              hour—one-two—three—four. I had gone to bed before three. Had I only been awake an
                              hour? It seemed
                              incredible. Getting up on tip-toe, vaguely afraid myself of breaking the silence,
                              I noiselessly
                              pushed aside the heavy curtains and looked out.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2695"> The moon had set, but by the frosty starlight the outline of the great snow-laden
                              trees and the wide
                              sweep of white drive were still dimly visible. All was silent without as within. Not
                              a branch moved
                              or let fall its freight of snow. There was not a breath of wind stirring. I was on
                              the point of
                              getting back into bed, when I thought in the distance I heard a sound. I listened
                              intently. No! I
                              must have been mistaken. Ah! again, and 1o7 <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="118" data-tei-n="108"> </a></span> nearer. I held my
                              breath. I could distinctly hear a stealthy step coming up the stairs. My room was
                              the nearest to the
                              staircase end of the corridor, and anyone coming up the stairs must pass my door.
                              With a presence of
                              mind which I am glad to say rarely deserts me, I blew out my candle, slipped to the
                              door, and
                              noiselessly opened it a chink.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2700">Someone was coming down the corridor with the lightness of a cat, candle in hand,
                              as a faint light
                              showed me. Another moment and I saw Charles, pale and haggard, still in evening dress,
                              coming
                              towards me. He was without his shoes. He passed my door and went noiselessly into
                              his own room, a
                              little further down the passage. There was the faintest suspicion of a sound, as of
                              a key being
                              gently turned in the lock, and then all was still again—stiller than ever.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2704"> ' What could Charles have been after?' I wondered. He could not have been returning
                              from seeing
                              Denis, who was not only much better, but was in the room beyond his <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="119" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span> own. And why had he still got on his evening clothes at four o'clock in the morning?
                              I determined
                              to ask him about it next day as I got back into bed again, and then, while wondering
                              about it and
                              trying to get warm, I fell fast asleep. I was only roused, after being twice called,
                              to find that it
                              was broad daylight, and to hear the boxes being carried down of many of the guests
                              who were leaving
                              by an early train.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e2709">I was late, but not so late as some. Breakfast was still going on. Evelyn and Ralph
                              had been up to
                              see their friends off, but General and Mrs. Marston and Carr, who were staying on,
                              came in after I
                              did. Lady Mary and Aurelia were having breakfast in their own rooms. I think nothing
                              is more dreary
                              than a long breakfast-table, laid for large numbers, with half a dozen picnicing at
                              it among the
                              debris left by earlier ravages. Evelyn, behind the great silver urn, looked pale and
                              preoccupied,
                              and had very little to say for herself when I journeyed up to her 1og <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="120" data-tei-n="110"> </a></span>end of the table and sat down by her. She asked me twice if I took sugar,
                              and was not bright and alert and ready in conversation, as I think girls should be.
                              Carr, too, was
                              eating his breakfast in silence beside Mrs. Marston.

                              appetite. He sat
                              down wearily on the other side of Evelyn, and watched her pour out his coffee without
                              a word.

                           <p id="d7161e2756">I was just going to ask Charles what he had been doing walking about in his socks
                              the night before
                              when the door opened, and Ralph, whose absence I had not noticed, came in. He looked
                              much perturbed.
                              It seemed his father had been taken suddenly and alarmingly ill, while dressing. In
                              a moment all was
                              confusion. Evelyn precipitately left the room to go to him, while Charles rushed round
                              to the
                              stables to send a groom on horseback for the nearest doctor. Ralph followed him, and
                              the remainder
                              of the party gathered in a little knot round the fire, Mrs. Marston expressing the
                              sentiment of each
                              of us when she said that she thought visitors were very much in the way when <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="112"> </a></span>there was illness in the house, and that she regretted that she and her

                           <p id="d7161e2818">It was more like a command than an invitation ; but Carr, usually so quick to take
                              a slight, did not
                              seem to notice it, and merely said that he should be happy to go or stay, whichever
                              was most in
                              accordance with the wishes of others, and took up the newspaper. He and Charles did
                              not seem to get
                              on well. I could see that Charles had not seemed to take to him from the very first;
                              and Carr
                              certainly did not appear at ease in <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="124" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span>the house. Perhaps Charles
                              felt that he had rather failed in courtesy to him, for during the remainder of the
                              morning he hardly
                              let him out of his sight. He took him to see the stables, though Carr openly declared
                              that he did
                              not understand horses; he showed him his collection of Zulu weapons in the vestibule;
                              he even
                              started a game of billiards with him till the arrival of the doctor. I did not think
                              Carr took his
                              attentions in very good part, though he was too well-mannered to show it; but he looked
                              relieved
                              when Charles went upstairs with the doctor, and pitched his cue into the rack at once,
                              and came to
                              the hall fire where I was sitting, and where Aurelia presently joined us, fresh and
                              smiling, in the
                              prettiest of morning gowns. Everyone met in the hall. It was in the centre of the
                              house, and every
                              one coming up or down had to pass through it. Just now it was not so tempting an abode
                              as usual, for
                              the flowers and part of the stage had already been removed, and the bare boards with
                              their <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="125" data-tei-n="115"> </a></span>wooden supports gave an air of discomfort to the whole place.

                           <p id="d7161e2826">Aurelia opened wide eyes of horror at hearing Sir George was ill. She even got out
                              a tiny laced
                              pocket-handkerchief; but before she had had time to weep much into it and spoil her
                              pretty eyes the
                              doctor reappeared, accompanied by Charles and Ralph, and we all learned to our great
                              relief that Sir
                              George, though undoubtedly ill, was not dangerously so at present, though the greatest
                              care would be
                              necessary. Lady Mary had undertaken the nursing of her brother-in-law, and in her
                              the doctor
                              expressed the same confidence which parents are wont to feel in a stern schoolmaster.
                              In the
                              meantime, the patient was to be kept very quiet, and on no account to be disturbed.

                           <p id="d7161e2829">When the doctor had left, Ralph and Aurelia, who had actually seen nothing of each

                              <said id="d7161e3603" who="#charles">All Middleton told me confirmed me in my suspicions. Sir John had been murdered
                                 the night before Middleton sailed for England, a whisper of the jewels having no doubt
                                 gone
                                 abroad. Carr came on board next day, and made friends with Middleton. Whether he had
                                 anything to
                                 do with the murder or not, God knows! but he found out—nay, Middleton openly told
                                 him that he
                                 had jewels of great value in his possession, which he carried about on his person.
                                 Carr was the
                                 only person aware of that fact. What follows ? Carr has Middleton's address in London.
                                 Middleton
                                 goes to the house and finds that his sister has moved to the next street. The house
                                 to which he
                                 first went is broken into, and the poor woman in it is murdered, or dies of fright,
                                 that same
                                 night. I mention this as coincidence number <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="146" data-tei-n="136"> </a></span>one. The following
                                 evening Middleton, having by chance left the jewels at home, dines and goes to the
                                 theatre by
                                 appointment with Carr. Unique cab accident occurs, in which Middleton is knocked on
                                 the head and
                                 rendered unconscious. Coincidence number two. Miss Middleton's house is broken into
                                 that same
                                 night on Middleton's return to it. Coincidence number three. When I put all this together
                                 last
                                 night, remembering that Carr, by Middleton's own account, was the only person aware
                                 that he had
                                 jewels of great value in his keeping, I felt absolutely certain (as I feel still)
                                 that he had
                                 accepted the invitation and come down from London solely for the purpose of stealing
                                 them. It
                                 was pure conjecture on my part, and I dared say nothing beyond begging Ralph not to
                                 leave the
                                 jewels in the library—which, however, he did. I went straight off to my room when
                                 the others
                                 went to smoke, but I did not go to bed. The more I thought it over, the more certain
                                 I felt that
                                 Carr would not let <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="147" data-tei-n="137"> </a></span> slip such an opportunity, the more
                                 convinced that an attempt would be made that very night. I did not know that he was
                                 not sleeping
                                 in the house, but I knew Ralph was at the lodge, so I could not go and consult with
                                 him as I
                                 should otherwise have done. I thought of going to Middleton, whose room was close
                                 to mine, but
                                 on second thoughts I gave up the idea. I am glad I did. At last I determined I would
                                 wait till
                                 the house was quiet, and that then I would go down alone, and watch in the library
                                 in the dark.
                                 I lay down on my bed in my clothes to wait, and then—I had been up most of the night
                                 before with
                                 Denis, and was dead beat with acting and dancing—by ill luck I fell asleep. When I
                                 woke up, I
                                 found to my horror that it was close on four o'clock. I instantly slipped off my shoes,
                                 and
                                 crept out of my room and down the stairs. I could not get to the library from the
                                 hall, as the
                                 stage blocked the way, and I had to go all the way round by the drawing-room and morning-<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="148" data-tei-n="138"> </a></span>room. As I went I thought how easy it would be for Carr to
                                 force the lock of the drawer; and so, it flashed across me, could I. Oh! Ralph
                              </said>,' said
                              Charles. '
                              <said id="d7161e3612" who="#charles">I went down solely to look after your property for you, but I 
                                 <hi id="d7161e3614" style="font-style: italic;">did</hi> think of it. I hope I should not have done it, but I suddenly remembered
                                 how hard pressed I was for money, and I did think of the crescent, and how you would
                                 hardly miss
                                 it, and how-but what does it matter now ? When I got to the library I found I was
                                 too late. The
                                 lock of the drawer had been forced, and it was empty. There was nothing for it but
                                 to go back to
                                 my room. I felt as certain that Carr had done it as that I am standing here; but I
                                 dared say
                                 nothing this morning, for fear of drawing an ever-ready parental suspicion on myself—which,
                                 however, Middleton did for me. All I could do was to keep Carr well in sight until
                                 the theft was
                                 found out, to prevent any possibility of his escaping, and then to accuse him. There
                                 
                              </said>!'
                              said Charles, '

                                 did not take the jewels. That is absolutely proved, and the sooner he is let out the

                                 and, considering the circumstances, I should say the sooner he is out of the house
                                 the better.
                                 As he has been wrongly suspected, I think the robbery had better not be mentioned

                              was all. He was evidently as anxious to be off as the Danvers were that he should
                              go. The dog-cart
                              was ordered, a servant despatched to the lodge in hot <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="156" data-tei-n="146"> </a></span>haste to
                              pack his portmanteau, and in half an hour he was bidding us good-bye, evidently glad
                              to say it. Poor
                              fellow! he little guessed, as he shook hands with us, how shamefully he had been suspected,
                              how
                              villainously he had been traduced behind his back. Somehow or other I had not had
                              a moment of
                              conversation with him since the morning, or a single chance of telling him how I had
                              stood up for
                              him in his absence. Either Charles or Marston was always at hand, and when he took
                              leave of me I
                              could only shake his hand warmly, and tell him to come and see me again in town. I
                              watched him
                              spinning down the drive in the dog-cart, little thinking how soon I should see him
                              again, and in
                              what circumstances.

                                 lying
                                 together with others, and I instantly recognized it as the same that had been wrapped
                                 round
                                 the diamond crescent when Colonel Middleton first showed us the jewels. I should never
                                 have
                                 noticed it—for though it was rice paper, it looked just like the other pieces strewn
                                 about—if I had not seen two little angular <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="180" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span> tears, which I
                                 suddenly remembered making in it myself when General Marston asked me not to pull
                                 it to
                                 pieces, which I suppose I had been absently doing. I made some sort of exclamation
                                 of
                                 surprise, and Aurelia turned round sharply and asked me what was the matter. As I
                                 did not
                                 answer, she left her packing and came to the table. She saw in a moment what I was
                                 looking
                                 at. I had turned as red as fire, and she was quite white. " I did not mean you to
                                 see that,"
                                 she said at last, quietly taking up the paper. " I meant no one to know until I had
                                 shown it
                                 to Ralph. 
                                 <hi id="d7161e4592" style="font-style: italic;">Do you know where I found it ?</hi>" and she looked hard at me. I
                                 could only shake my head. I was too much ashamed of a suspicion I had had to be able
                                 to get
                                 out a word. " I am very sorry," continued Aurelia, "but I am afraid it will be my
                                 duty to
                                 tell Ralph, whatever the consequences may be. I have been thinking it over, and I
                                 think he
                                 ought to know. I am going to show it him to-night after dinner," and she <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="181" data-tei-n="#"> </a></span>172 THE DANVERS JEWELS put it in her pocket and then began to cry.
                                 I did not know what to say or do, I was so frightened at the thought of what was coming;
                                 and, as the dressing-bell rang at that moment, I was just leaving the room when she
                                 called
                                 me back

                              led into the hall, and watched him going <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="188" data-tei-n="179"> </a></span>down, step by step,
                              with lagging tread. From the morning-room came the distant sound of a piano, and a

                              singing to it, singing softly as though no Nemesis were approaching; singing slowly

                              were time enough and to spare. But Nemesis had reached the bottom of the staircase;
                              Nemesis with
                              a heavy step was going across the silent hall—was even now opening the door of the
                              morning-room.
                              The door was gently closed again, and then, in the middle of a bar the music stopped.

                              up to the door. The snow had drifted heavily before the steps, and right up into the

                              and the cart had to go round to the back again before we could get in and start. Charles

                              the reins, and his brother got up beside him. The groom and I squeezed ourselves into

                              motionless in the low mist, and making no sound. A lonely colt, with tail erect, ran
                              beside us
                              on the other side of the hedge as far as his field would allow him, his heavy <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="195" data-tei-n="186"> </a></span> hoofs falling noiseless in the snow. The cold was intense.

                              as he whispered in a hoarse voice:

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5246">'
                              <said id="d7161e5248" who="#charles">You shall</said>,' replied Charles; and he moved forward a little, and
                              waited for the passengers to alight. I felt that any chance of escape which lay in
                              eluding those
                              keen light eyes would be small indeed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5252">Then ensued a scene of confusion, a Babel of tongues, as the passengers poured out
                              upon the
                              platform. '
                              <said id="d7161e5254" who="#trueenglishman"> What was the meaning <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="195"> </a></span>of it all 
                              </said>?' hotly demanded an infuriated little man before he was well out of the
                              carriage. Why had a train been allowed to start if it was to be overturned by a snow-drift
                              ?
                              What had the company been about not to make itself aware of the state of the line
                              ? What did the
                              railway officials mean by, etc., etc.? But he was not going to put up with such scandalous
                              treatment. He should cause an inquiry to be made; he should write to the 
                              <hi id="d7161e5259" style="font-style: italic;">Times</hi>, he should—in short, he behaved like a true Englishman in adverse circumstances,
                              and
                              poured forth abuse like water. Others followed—some angry, some silent, all cold and
                              miserable.
                              A stout woman in black, who had been sent for to a dying child, was weeping aloud;
                              a dazed man
                              with bound-up head and a terrified wife was pounced upon immediately by expectant
                              friends, and
                              borne off with voluble sympathy. One or two people slightly hurt were helped out after
                              the
                              others. The train was emptied at last. Aurelia was not there. Charles went down <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="205" data-tei-n="196"> </a></span> the length of the train, looking into each carriage, and then came
                              back, answering Ralph's glance with a shake of the head. The man in black, who seemed
                              to have
                              been watching him, came up.

                              followed him. I thought him a very pushing, inquisitive kind of person. I have always
                              had a
                              great dislike to the idle curiosity which is continually prying into the concerns
                              of others.
                              Ralph and I walked up and down, up and down the now deserted platform. I spoke to
                              him once or
                              twice, but he hardly answered; and after a time I gave it up, and we paced in silence.

                           <p id="d7161e5335">At last Charles returned. His request for an engine had been refused, but a further
                              relay of
                              workmen was being sent down the line in a couple of hours' time, and he had obtained
                              leave for
                              himself and us to go with them. After two long interminable hours of that everlasting
                              pacing we
                              found ourselves in an open truck full of workmen steaming slowly out of the station.
                              At the last

                           <p id="d7161e5340">The pace may have been great, but to us it seemed exasperatingly slow, and in the

                              cold was piercing. The workmen, who laughed and talked among themselves, appeared
                              to take no
                              notice of it; but I saw that Charles was shivering, and presently he made his brother
                              light his
                              pipe and began to smoke hard himself.

                              suddenly to
                              his brother, and said, as if unable to keep silence on what was in his mind :

                           <p id="d7161e5364">We had left the suburbs now, and were passing through a lonely country. Here and there
                              a village
                              of straggling cottages met the eye, clustering round their little church. In places
                              the
                              hedgerows alone marked the lie of the hidden lanes; in others men were digging out
                              the roads
                              through drifts of snow, and carts and horses were struggling painfully along. In one
                              place a
                              little walking funeral was labouring across the fields from a lonely cottage in the
                              direction of
                              the church high on the hill, the bell of which was tolling through the quiet air.
                              The sound
                              reached us as we passed, and seemed to accompany us on our way. I heard the men talking
                              among
                              themselves that there had been no snow-storm like this for thirty years; and as they
                              spoke some
                              of them began shading their eyes, and trying to look in the direction in which we
                              were
                              going.

                              marking the
                              bed of a frozen stream. Near the line was a deserted brick-kiln surrounded by long
                              uneven mounds
                              and ridges of ice, with three poplars mounting guard over it. Flights of rooks hung
                              over the
                              barren ground, and wheeled in the air with discordant clamour as we passed-the only

                              moving things in the utter desolation of the scene. As I looked there was an exclamation
                              from
                              one of the workmen, and the engine began to slacken. We were there at last.

                              under which the rail went at a sharp curve. The snow had drifted heavily against the
                              bridge with
                              its high earth embankment, making manifest at a glance the cause of the disaster.

                           <p id="d7161e5383">The bridge was crowded with human figures, and on the line below men were working
                              in the drift,
                              amid piles of 
                              <hi id="d7161e5385" style="font-style: italic;">débris</hi> and splintered wood. The wrecked train had all been
                              slightly draped in snow; the engine alone, barely cold, lying black and grim, like
                              some mighty
                              giant, formidable in death. A sheet of glassy ice near it showed how the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="211" data-tei-n="202"> </a></span> boiler had burst. Some of the hindermost carriages were still
                              standing, or had fallen comparatively uninjured; but others seemed to have leaped
                              upon their
                              fellows, and ploughed right through them into the drift. It was well that it began
                              to snow as we
                              reached the spot. There were traces of dismal smears on the white ground, which it
                              would be
                              seemly to hide.

                           <p id="d7161e5391">Our friend in black went forward and asked a few questions of the man in charge, and
                              presently
                              returned.

                              to a house at a little distance; and, without further delay, we began to scramble
                              up the steep
                              embankment, and clamber over the stone wall of the bridge into the road.

                           <p id="d7161e5401">My mind was full of other things, but I remember still the number of people assembled
                              on the
                              bridge, and how a man was standing up in his donkey-cart to view the scene. It was
                              Saturday, and
                              there were <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="212" data-tei-n="203"> </a></span> quantities of village schoolboys sitting astride
                              on the low wall, or perched on adjacent hurdles, evidently enjoying the spectacle,
                              jostling,
                              bawling, eating oranges, and throwing the peel at the engine. Some older people touched
                              their
                              hats sympathetically, and one went and opened a gate for us into a field, through
                              which many
                              feet seemed to have come and gone; but, for the greater number, the event was evidently
                              regarded
                              as an interesting variation in the dull routine of everyday life, and to the schoolboys
                              it was
                              an undoubted treat.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5406">Ralph and Charles walked on in front, following the track across the field. It was
                              not
                              particularly heavy walking after what we had had earlier in the day, but Ralph stumbled
                              perpetually, and presently Charles drew his arm through his own, and the two went
                              on together,
                              the police-inspector following with me.

                              straw in the centre of the yard, lowered their heads, and looked askance at us as
                              we came in,
                              and a party of ducks retreated hastily from our path with a chorus of exclamations,
                              while a thin
                              collie dog burst out of a barrel at the back door and made a series of gymnastics
                              at the end of
                              a chain, barking hoarsely, as if he had not spared himself of late.

                           <p id="d7161e5414">An elderly woman with red arms met us at the door, and, on a whisper from the police-inspector,
                              first shook her head, and then, in answer to a further whisper, nodded at another
                              door, and, a
                              voice calling her from within, hastily disappeared.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5417">The inspector opened the door she had indicated, and went in, I with him. Charles,
                              who had grown
                              very grave, hung back with Ralph, who seemed too much dazed to notice anything in
                              heaven above
                              or the earth beneath. The door opened into an outhouse, roughly paved with round stones,
                              where
                              <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="214" data-tei-n="205"> </a></span>barrels, staves, and divers lumber had been put away.
                              There was straw in the further end of it, out of which a yellow cat raised two gleaming
                              eyes,
                              and then flew up a ladder against the wall, and disappeared among the rafters. In
                              the middle of
                              the floor, lying a little apart, were three figures with sheets over them. Instinctively
                              we felt
                              that we were in the presence of death. I looked back at Charles and Ralph, who were
                              still
                              standing outside in the falling snow. Charles was bareheaded, but Ralph was looking
                              absently in
                              front of him seemingly conscious of nothing. The inspector made me a sign. He had
                              raised one of
                              the sheets, and now withdrew it altogether. My heart seemed to stand still. 
                              <hi id="d7161e5421" style="font-style: italic;">It was
                                 Aurelia!
                              </hi>—Aurelia, changed in the last great change of all, but still Aurelia.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5425">The fixed artificial colour in the cheek consorted ill with the bloodless pallor of
                              the rest of
                              the face, which was set in a look of surprise and terror. She was altered beyond <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="215" data-tei-n="206"> </a></span> what should have been. She looked several years older. But it was
                              still Aurelia. Those little gloved hands, tightly clenched, were the same which she
                              had held to
                              the library fire as we talked the day before; even the dress was the same. Alas !
                              she had been
                              in too great a hurry to change it before she left, or her thin shoes. Poor little
                              Aurelia ! And
                              then —I don't know how it was, but in another moment Ralph was kneeling by her, bending
                              over
                              her, taking the stiffened hands in his trembling clasp, imploring the deaf ears to
                              hear him,
                              calling wildly to the pale lips, which had done with human speech, to speak to him.
                              I could not
                              bear it, and I turned away and looked out through the open door at the snow falling.
                              The
                              inspector came and stood beside me.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5431">In the silence which followed we could hear Charles speaking gently from time to time;
                              and when
                              at last we both turned towards them again, Ralph had flung himself down on an old
                              bench at the
                              further end of <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="216" data-tei-n="207"> </a></span> the outhouse, with his back turned towards us,
                              his arms resting on a barrel, and his head bowed down upon them. He neither spoke
                              nor moved.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7161e5436">Charles left him and came towards us, and he and the inspector spoke apart for a moment;
                              and then
                              the latter dropped on his knees beside the dead woman, and after looking carefully
                              at a dark
                              stain on one of the wrists, turned back the sleeve. Crushed deep into the round, white
                              arm
                              gleamed something bright. It was an emerald bracelet, which we both knew. Charles
                              cast a hasty
                              glance at Ralph; but he had not moved, and he drew me beside him, so as to interpose
                              our two
                              figures between him and the inspector. The latter quietly turned down the sleeve,
                              and recomposed
                              the arm.

                              said, in a low voice. '

                           <p id="d7161e5448">He gazed long and earnestly at the dead <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="217" data-tei-n="208"> </a></span>face, and then to my
                              horror he suddenly unfastened the little hat. I made an involuntary movement as if
                              to stop him,
                              but Charles laid an iron grip upon me and motioned me to be still. The stealthy hand
                              quietly
                              pushed back the fair curls upon the forehead, and in another moment they fell still
                              further
                              back, showing a few short locks of dark hair beneath them, which so completely altered
                              the dead
                              face that I could hardly recognise it as belonging to the same person. The inspector
                              raised his
                              head and looked significantly at Charles. Then he quietly drew forward the yellow
                              hair over the
                              forehead again, replaced the hat, and rose to his feet. Charles and I glanced apprehensively
                              at
                              Ralph, but he had not stirred. As we looked, a hurried step came across the yard,
                              a hand raised
                              the latch of the door, and someone entered abruptly. It was Carr. For one moment he
                              stood in the
                              doorway, for one moment his eyes rested, horror-struck, on the dead woman, then <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="218" data-tei-n="209"> </a></span> darted at us, from us to the inspector, who was coolly watching him,
                              and—he was gone! gone as suddenly as he had come, gone swiftly out again into the
                              falling snow,
                              followed by the wild barking of the dog.

                           <p id="d7161e5566">According to him, Carr, who had never been seen or heard of since the day after the
                              accident, was
                              a professional thief who had probably gone to—, in India, with the express design
                              of obtaining
                              possession of Sir John's jewels, which had, till near the time of his death, been
                              safely stowed
                              away in a bank in Calcutta. He and his wife usually worked together, but on this occasion
                              she
                              had, by means of her engaging manners and youthful appearance, struck up an acquaintance
                              abroad
                              with Lady Mary Cunningham, who, it will be remembered, had jewels of considerable
                              value, with a
                              view to those jewels. Ralph she had used as her tool, and engaged herself to him in
                              the
                              expectation that on her return to England she might, by means of her intimacy with
                              the family,
                              have an opportunity of taking them, Lady Mary having left them, while abroad, with
                              her banker in
                              London. The opportunity came while she was at Stoke <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="224" data-tei-n="215"> </a></span>Moreton,
                              but in the meanwhile Sir John's priceless legacy had arrived, having eluded her husband's
                              vigilance. (That certainly was true. The jewels were safe enough as long as I had
                              anything to do
                              with them.) Her husband, who followed them, saw that he was suspected, and threw the
                              game into
                              her hands, devoting himself entirely to putting his own innocence beyond a doubt,
                              in which, with
                              Ralph's assistance, he succeeded.

                                 had probably no idea that he was the friend whom you had telegraphed for. I suspect,
                                 too,
                                 that same evening, after the ball, when she and Carr went together to find the bag,
                                 it was
                                 to have a last word to enable them to play into each other's hands, being aware, if
                                 I
                                 remember rightly, that father had gone to bed in company with the key of the safe,
                                 and that
                                 consequently the jewels might be left within easier reach than s1'5 <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="#"> </a></span> usual. No doubt she weighed the matter in her own mind, and
                                 decided to give up all thought of Lady Mary's jewels, and to secure those which were
                                 ten
                                 times their value. She could not have taken both without drawing suspicion upon herself.
                                 Like a wise woman, she left the smaller, and went in for the larger prize; a less
                                 clever one
                                 would have tried for both and have failed. She failed, it is true, by an oversight.
                                 She
                                 could never have noticed that the piece of paper wrapped round the crescent was peculiar
                                 in
                                 any way, or she would not have left it on the table among the others. She turned it
                                 off well
                                 when Evelyn recognised it, and made the most of her time. She was within an ace of
                                 success,
                                 but fate was against her. And Carr lost no time either, for that matter ; for I have
                                 since
                                 found out that the telegram she sent was to Birmingham, where he was no doubt hiding,
                                 bidding him meet her in London earlier than had been arranged. Of course he set off
                                 for the
                                 scene of the accident directly he heard of it, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="226" data-tei-n="217"> </a></span> having
                                 received no further communication from her. We only arrived ten minutes before him.
                                 For my
                                 part, I admired her more than I ever did before, when the truth about her came out.
                                 I
                                 considered her to be a pink and white nonentity without an idea beyond a neat adjustment
                                 of
                                 pearl-powder, and then found that she possessed brains enough to outwit two minds
                                 of no mean
                                 calibre, namely, yours, Middleton, and my own. Evelyn was the only person who had
                                 the
                                 slightest suspicion of her, and that hardly amounted to more than an instinct, for
                                 she owned
                                 that she had no reason to show for it

                                 distrust their own nearest relatives, especially their prepossessing nephews, and

                                 herself out to be taken a fancy to. In short, she trusted to her own judgment, and
                                 it failed
                                 her, as usual. I wrote very kindly to her from abroad, telling her how sincerely I
                                 sympathized with her in her distress at finding how entirely her judgment had been
                                 at fault,
                                 how lamentably she had been deceived from first to last, and how much trouble she
                                 had been
                                 the innocent means of bringing on the family. I have had no reply. Dear Aunt Mary!

                                 reminds me that she is in London now; and I think a call from me, and a personal expression
                                 of sympathy, might give her pleasure
                              </said>.' And he rose to take his leave.

                              any of the numerous letters I wrote to him, or ever came to see me in London, as I
                              had
                              particularly asked him to do. Of course, I did not believe that he was married to
                              Aurelia, for
                              it was only on the word of a stranger and a police-inspector, while I knew from his
                              own lips
                              that he was engaged to a countrywoman of his own. However, be that how it may, my
                              own rooted
                              conviction at the time, which has remained unshaken ever since, is that in some way
                              he became
                              aware that he was unjustly suspected, and being, like all Americans, of a sensitive
                              nature, he
                              retired to his native land. Anyhow, I have never seen or heard anything of him since.
                              I am aware
                              that Jane holds a different opinion, but then Charles had prejudiced her against him;
                              so much
                              so, that it has ended by becoming a subject on which we do not converse together.

                              the first cool time in the day, when he walked in. He looked pale and jaded as he
                              sat down
                              wearily by us at the open window and stroked the cat, which was taking the air on
                              the sill. He
                              said that he felt the heat, and he certainly looked very much knocked up. I do not
