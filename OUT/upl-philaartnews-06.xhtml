                           in America, was founded in 1889, a time when women were not encouraged to exhibit
                           their work. Since then, the prejudice against women artists has of course vanished,
                           but the organization continues to be valuable, not only because of its sponsorship
                           of several exhibitions every year, but also because of its travelling shows composed
                           of members’ work. The Association was among the pioneers in this field of art activity.

                        <p id="d7263e241">The print reproduced above is one of a long series of annual self-portraits which
                           give interesting data on the artist’s life. She was born in Koenigsborg, East Prussia
                           in 1867. In her youth she went to Berlin to study engraving under Stauffer Bern, the
                           well known artist. In 1891 she married Karl Kollwitz, a Berlin physician. Her two
                           sons served in the World War, one being killed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e245">At this time she became greatly interested in pacifism and in social problems. In
                           one series of wood-cuts she depicted scenes from the French Revolution. Another set
                           of prints showed the sweat-shop conditions, the misery and unrest of the hand-loom
                           weavers in Silesia, conditions which resulted from the introduction of the modern
                           power loom in 1848.

                        <p id="d7263e248">Both during and after the World War, she designed posters to raise funds for charitable
                           organizations. She also did some modeling during this period, executing a two figure
                           war memorial.

                        <p id="d7263e270">An international exhibition of modern rugs is an encouraging spectacle. Particularly
                           is it encouraging, when it is placed in the middle of a typical rug department where
                           one vacillates between pleasure and disgust at the alternately good and bad of average
                           floor coverings. Strawbridge and Clothier have done at once a wise and a brave thing
                           in sponsoring this exhibit of modern rugs from eleven nations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e273">The rugs vary as to size, shape and pattern but there are certain characteristics
                           which apply to the group as a whole: the almost universal use of geometric rather
                           than naturalistic design; the wide range of clear yet unobtrusive colors; and the
                           simplicity. Here are rugs that are both beautiful in themselves and in combination
                           with other furnishings. They have individuality but avoid being stridently dramatic.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e277">The United States has, naturally enough, the largest number of entries, many of the
                           most prominent designers in the country being represented. Two rugs planned by E.
                           F. Zimmerman are here, one particularly interesting. This is in a blue weave that
                           resembles homespun and is tufted in a cream, circular pattern. Stanislaus V’Soske
                           is represented by two sculptured rugs, similar in type to those recently displayed
                           at the Art Alliance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e280">The foreign work frequently reveals the nationality of the artist. Evelyn Wyld, of
                           France recalls certain abstractions of Modern French painting in her design. The rug
                           is a tan oblong with heavy brown fringe. The central design is composed of incised
                           and raised surfaces which create an effect not dissimilar to the poise and quiet of
                           a George Braque. English conservatism is seen in Marian Pepler’s rough grey rug, in
                           which the pattern is formed by thin white and red lines with regular accent of black.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e283">The exhibition originated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and is lent
                           to Strawbridge and Clothier’s through the courtesy of that institution.

                        <p id="d7263e336">Is it an organization of swindlers, a business house run on a cold-blooded percentage
                           basis for profit, or a privately owned institution where practical financial considerations
                           are less important than the desire to serve both artist and discriminating public

                        <p id="d7263e339">There are artists and artists—galleries and galleries. Without artists and galleries
                           we would find ourselves impoverished, and with the wrong kind of artists and galleries
                           the situation offers equal hopelessness.

                        <p id="d7263e342">There are many unsolved problems relative to both the creator and dispenser of art.
                           There seems to exist more dissension than harmony between artist and gallery—many
                           misconceptions, and frequent lack of co-operation necessary to put art where it belongs:
                           into the homes of the people.

                        <p id="d7263e345">Beginning with the next issue of the Philadelphia Art News, we propose a series of
                           editorials in which we shall consider impartially the vital problems of the situation,
                           in the hope of contributing toward the ultimate Utopia of artist AND gallery, rather
                           than artist VERSUS gallery.

                        <p id="d7263e348">At the moment, one of Philadelphia’s most stimulating exhibitions is in progress.
                           Thirteen local painters have grouped representative works in the gallery of the Philadelphia
                           Sketch Club, to offer a showing of canvases devoid of “commercialism” in any respect.
                           They are pure paintings which have not been executed by commission, or for any possible
                           material advantage.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e352">This, in itself, is definitely stimulating. It is rare, in any walk of life, to find
                           those who give willingly without receiving, and our artists do more of it than any
                           other professional fraternity. Likewise, there is the added interest of comparison
                           between these, the purists in art, and their more mercenary brethren. The result is
                           more than advantageous to these painters.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e355">Leon Karp is one of the most distinctive contributors. His works are almost invariably
                           sombre, and the two canvases shown here are among his finest: a seated woman and child,
                           and a flower study. (There are, incidentally, no titles attached to any of the paintings.)
                           In the larger canvas, the figures are realized with great delicacy and expressiveness
                           of gray against black.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e358">The impact of pigmental dynamite is to be found in the nude study by Arthur Carles,
                           who shows likewise a floral canvas of extraordinary force and vigor. Walter Reinsel
                           has felt the swirl of trees and has controlled them beautifully, no less than the
                           figure lying in a hammock—on the whole, a fine organization of mass.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e361">Lucius Crowell’s oils are full of individuality. Each creation is a separate problem
                           in color and composition, always accomplished with immense verve. From Emlen Etting
                           come two abstractions in which are revealed a decided inclination toward discs and
                           circles of color. Being absolutely “non-representational”, they are, nevertheless,
                           as thoroughly personal to the artist as a canvas can be.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e364">Walter Stuempfig’s two small pictures, one of musicians, the other obviously the interment
                           of Christ, are works of finesse, delicacy and great purity of color. Earl Horter’s
                           study of a harbor is most unassuming, tonally, and for all its static quality, manifests
                           enormous variety of form. There is also one of the spontaneous water color nudes for
                           which Horter is noted.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e367">In point of area covered, John Kucera, of Gimbel mural fame, is most lavishly represented,
                           there being four quite large canvases, more like small murals than large easel pictures.
                           There is no doubt of Kucera’s native feeling for the mural—he seems to conceive habitually
                           in extravagant dimensions, and there are few young painters who have more breadth
                           than he. However, we get more from his canvases when we examine them as miniatures
                           than when we are sufficiently removed to embrace visionally the entire work. At close
                           range they reveal small areas of positively exquisite color and plasticity, which
                           otherwise are completely lost. Kucera will grow, and his present occasional lapses
                           in pictorial unity will, we trust, disappear. He should mature enviably.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e371">As the antithesis of Kucera’s turbulent and dramatic point of view, we may cite five
                           of the latest canvases of Morris Blackburn, who has lately undergone something of
                           an aesthetic metamorphosis. Interested primarily in the interpretation of form by
                           means of flat areas and lines of color, we can imagine the ease with which many spectators
                           will miss the idea. Upon superficial observation they appear to be little more than
                           patterns, but sufficient contemplation uncovers a very definite sense of form. Blackburn’s
                           palette has begun to reject grays, and, despite the contrast afforded by his brilliant
                           segments of positive color, they are quite at ease with each other.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e374">Matthew Sharpe has produced a remarkable decorative canvas—a symphony in blue, violet
                           and green, unobtrusive and restful, although sizable. Another still life of fruit
                           from the same painter, is more reminiscent of his former treatment. Leon Kelly, who
                           relies almost too much upon black outlines, is represented by three canvases of amazing
                           forcefulness—a large still life, small figure study, and a landscape which is one
                           of the finest Kelly’s we’ve seen. In this instance the black outline has not run away
                           with the picture, but contributes vitally to the solidity of ground and trees.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e377">The iridescent charm of Raphael Sabatini’s color is well known, and his present canvas,
                           of cactus and fruit, is an achievement in visual poetry. An impressionistic landscape
                           from Carroll Tyson completes the showing, and seems curiously out of place, so definitely
                           does it breathe the air of another world. However, it is fresh air, and invigorating.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e380">Realizing that this exhibition by no means exhausts the list of “non-commercial” painters,
                           we should like to find more such groups springing up to give us equally stimulating
                           shows.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e383">The Ninth Annual Exhibition of Prints by Philadelphia Artists is now to be seen at
                           the Print Club. It is a lively and varied show, offering an excellent cross-section
                           of Philadelphia printmaking.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e386">The jury consisted of Mrs. William B. Linn, Mrs. William T. Tonner, Staunton B. Peck,
                           Benton Spruance and Hobson Pittman, awarding the John Gribbel Memorial Prize of fifty
                           dollars to Robert Riggs for his technically superb lithograph—“Elephant Act”. Cynthia
                           Iliff was given Honorable Mention for her aquatint, “Patterns of Time”, a beautifully
                           handled and decorative comment upon tombstones, while similar distinction was accorded
                           Richard Hood for “Sunday Shampoo”, a drypoint nicely conceived along the vignette
                           principle, with shades of Blampied in its cross-hatching. “Afternoon in Arizona”,
                           an aquatint by Arthur Bloch, Jr., was likewise handed an Honorable Mention, and we
                           can’t imagine why.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e390">Outstanding in the lithographic section is Benton Spruance, whose “Fencers” is a masterful
                           and imaginative interpretation. Here resides the drama of the moment beautifully expressed.
                           Earl Miller’s “Indian Woman, Lydi”, with her flat, poster-like hair and delicate skin,
                           offers an unique graphic appeal, while Henry C. Pitz retains his usual ruggedness.
                           For the sake of variety, we are one day looking forward to a bit of pure lyricism
                           from Pitz; we’d like to see what he does with it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e393">A distinct, and excellent, technique in lithography is furnished by Julius Bloch in
                           “Tired Hitch-Hiker”, well composed and eloquent. Alfred Bendiner waxes quite merry
                           in “The Romance of Archaeology—‘Discovery’”—its verve and humor are outstanding. We
                           like Bendiner’s work and he should have a wide audience.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e396">Last, but by all odds not least, among the lithographs, is the creation by Barbara
                           Crawford called “Ladies Prepare”. To this we give the cake, and why it was not granted
                           at least an Honorable Mention we fail to comprehend. It is graphically the most vitally
                           creative contribution to the show.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e399">Among those represented by the bitten plate or drypoint, Jacob Landau’s etching “Amputation
                           in Middle Ages” is arresting because of the delicacy with which he has delineated
                           a gruesome subject: a gentleman engaged (none too gracefully) in having his leg sawed
                           off without benefit of anesthetic. It is a fine plate, and our only quarrel is with
                           the figures, which savor somewhat patently of draughtsmanship common to Renaissance
                           artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e402">Isabelle Lazarus Miller shows us a “Merry-go-round” in aquatint—a delightful print,
                           light in touch and full of amusing patterns. From Frank Vanacore comes an etching,
                           “Road Makers”, which merits considerably more than little attention. It is a valid
                           document of honest expression with no finesse dangling around—which, in this case,
                           adds great power to its simple linear construction. Herbert Pullinger shows etchings
                           of the “Old Post Office, Philadelphia” and “Broad Street Station and City Hall”, while
                           Edwin F. Faber creates a plate appropriately enough labelled “Cataleptic”, a courageous
                           but rather stiff attempt at the macabre.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e405">The first things that met our eyes in the block prints were “Little Fighter” and “The
                           Clown” by Julia Bloch, both cats upon their hind legs, the former black upon a white
                           background, the latter white on black. Both are bold and do their duty effectively.
                           Karl Sherman utilizes Van Gogh swirls in his dark “Apple Harvest”, and Michael Gallagher,
                           in “Coal-Pickers”, achieves strength and graphic activity. Angelo and Salvatore Pinto
                           contribute striking wood engravings bearing astonishing similarity of treatment. They
                           reveal the patience and love of texture inherent in their creators.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e409">Herman Bacharach’s “Corn” is notable for its static but forceful decorative flatness
                           of line and mass. Hobson Pittman’s “House at Beach Arlington” is a drama of clouds,
                           and Florence V. Cannon’s block print, “A Permanent”, makes the most of formal white
                           lines cut simply upon a black surface. Mary A. Frack shows the color print we like—a
                           composition of “Butterfly and Roses”. It is unusual in its delicacy of yellow against
                           gray and black.

                        <p id="d7263e415">An interesting comparison of the work of brother and sister may be made at the Warwick
                           Galleries’ exhibition of lithographs by John W. Gregory and Dorothy Lake Gregory.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e418">Voted one of America’s seventy-three best print-makers in the recent nation-wide poll
                           conducted by “Prints” magazine, John Gregory is represented in many museums and private
                           collections. He works exclusively with lithographs on stone and is one of the few
                           lithographers who do their own printing. Dorothy Lake Gregory is the wife of Ross
                           Moffett, artist, and has illustrated a number of books for children.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e421">Fantasy and decoration are the outstanding characteristics of Miss Gregory’s prints.
                           “The House of Seven Gables, Salem, Mass.” is by no means unlike the treatment of Wanda
                           Gag, and has much decorative charm. Other worldliness is the key-note of “Alice and
                           the White Knight”. It manifests a hard, decorative line and cunningly embodies many
                           of the characters of Lewis Carroll’s classic. Much the same general tonal idea is
                           to be found in “Little Women, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy”. It is nevertheless, somewhat
                           unyielding.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e424">In contrast, John Gregory’s vision is more palpably of this world—with, however, an
                           occasional dash of quaintness when he looks at his fellows. Their picturesque physical
                           traits find witty expression in such prints as “Full Speed Ahead, Boston Public Gardens”
                           and “Characterization”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e428">In looking about him, the artist has captured the real simplicity of shacks, harbors
                           and houses. Devoid of technical elaboration, they are quietly composed and have a
                           great deal of graphic substance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e431">Lithographs, wood-cuts and etchings by Kaethe Kollwitz at the Carlen Galleries constitute
                           one of the finest print shows that Philadelphia has seen.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e434">The personality of Kollwitz is quite as gigantic as most of her prints. With the possible
                           exception of Rosa Bonheur, never has there been a more vigorous and masculine woman
                           artist. Complete mastery of draughtsmanship is but the means of expressing her reaction,
                           not to the German scene, but to the poorer class of Germans around her. She looks
                           at her people with god-like compassion—she loves and pities them, and makes us do
                           the same.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e437">More than that, she may teach many of our younger propagandists in art that telling
                           a social tale does not necessarily involve sacrifice of the first qualities of art;
                           that in the work of a great artist (which we regard Kollwitz to be), the social message
                           can become an integral part of a fine work without obtruding itself unduly.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e440">The lithographs are most numerous, and here we find the artist’s most potent and free
                           expression. They have the spontaneity suggestive of working directly, and without
                           preliminary sketching.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e443">Frequently utilizing the flat of the crayon, Kollwitz disdains all non-essentials
                           and produces prints of enormous breadth and carrying power.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e447">Grace Thorpe Gemberling has a little secret of her own when she prepares her colors.
                           We don’t know what it is, but we have felt its effect—the undeniable stamp of an artist’s
                           color personality, as witness her canvases now to be seen at the Women’s University
                           Club.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e450">Color personality, incidentally, occurs none too frequently. When it does, monotony
                           is often its train-bearer. Fortunately, no such thing can be said in this case, and
                           we have ample reason to believe that it shall not in the future.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e453">As personal as are the creations of Grace Gemberling, there is extraordinary variety
                           in her canvases.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e456">This artist’s delineation of well-worn houses is unique as her interpretation of them
                           in color, and there is nothing we like more than the simple but fruitful wedding of
                           line and color mass.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e459">Control of detail is, in this case, an additional gift. Canvases may be flooded with
                           subsidiary graphic or pigmental themes, but there is never confusion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e462">Grace Gemberling is one of Philadelphia’s most promising painters.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e466">Commenting in the exhibition catalogue of oils by Fritz Noyes now to be seen at the
                           Boyer Galleries, Carl Shaffer calls the painter “as much philosopher as artist”. We
                           should like to add that he is equally a pigmental inhibitionist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e469">In these canvases there seems a definite lust for color, but lack of courage to exploit
                           it adequately. Consequently, many works that should have genuine brilliance are really
                           inconsistently gray.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e472">There are, however, two canvases: “Cedars in Cove” and “Cedars in Shadow”, both simple
                           and poetic, wherein the artist has taken the gray bull by the horns and created something
                           that does not hope to be colorful, but embodies a scheme of tone that is beautifully
                           and completely unified.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e475">A warm palette is in the possession of Louis Ribak, whose gouaches are being shown
                           at the Philadelphia A. C. A. Galleries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e478">It is an agreeable warmth, that sings harmoniously not only with Ribak’s line, but
                           with the general composition of this artist’s pictures. The vision is uncompromising,
                           pictorially—the painter has seen acutely, and painted simply, effectively, and in
                           so subdued a manner that there is scarcely a pure color in the exhibit.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e481">Nevertheless, this grayed color is extremely rich, because of its pigmental syntax.
                           The most remarkable inclusions are “Fall Plowing”, a poem of earth and clouds, “Second
                           Street”, a shaded road with and impact of design and color tone, and “Rockport”, with
                           vigor in its rocks and freshness in its blue sea.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e485">The Annual Water Color Exhibition of the Plastic Club is a keen disappointment.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e488">Water color, infinitely more than oil, is the medium of the individualist. The very
                           process of using it induces—and, in fact, specifically involves—the whimsey of the
                           moment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e491">In this show, the most patent quality is heavy, pedestrian and sometimes stupid painting.
                           We look almost in vain for free, sparkling treatment. Katherine H. McCormick, Lizette
                           Paravincini, Elizabeth F. Washington and A. Christaldi are all well known local contributors
                           but, unfortunately, they are not represented by their happiest work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e494">The most sprightly paintings are from the brushes of Augusta H. Peoples, Johanna Boericke
                           and Katherine Farrell.

                           Studios and galleries in this section and New York have been thoroughly combed for
                           unusual talent in painting, prints, sculpture and crafts. Restriction was placed upon
                           the age of the artist, none over thirty years being considered. The principal duty
                           of this show is defined as unearthing obscure but promising young artists, and giving
                           them an opportunity to exhibit where they previously had none.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e500">As a cross-section of coming American art one may regard the show with a great deal
                           of optimism. There is variety and much brilliance to these young American creations.
                           Work from the Philadelphia area was acquired through Settlement Music School, Boyer
                           Galleries, Friend’s Central School and Tyler School, among others.

                           for a third of he nation’s population. If we are really attempting to build for people
                           with large families and an annual income of from nothing to eighteen hundred dollars,
                           we must combine all forces, technical, economic, social and cultural. We have, through
                           legislative bodies, set out to do something which will not only change the life of
                           a very large group of our population but will be an emphatic factor in the economic
                           set up, and require the understanding and help of every citizen. It is always unpleasant
                           to do something which effects social forces, because there are people who do not like
                           it, or whose toes we step on. If we are really going to make any contribution in the
                           shaping of social forces, and do something for these people that is really good, and
                           not only the kind of good which they, or somebody else thinks is good for them, then
                           we have to do genuine work. We cannot stand back and let somebody else out there do
                           it.

                        <p id="d7263e917">All questions of policy in connection with housing, whether affecting population,
                           economics, financing or practical construction must culminate in the actual building
                           of the houses, which have to meet conditions that exist. It is here that these forces
                           take visible, lasting shape. Floor plans of dwellings have undergone a change and,
                           thanks to the influence of modern technical progress, the equipment and furnishings
                           of small dwellings have vastly improved. The dwellings must, first of all, serve the
                           welfare and habits of the tenants They must satisfy the daily needs of each person
                           in the household. Serviceableness and economic planning must be carried out in such
                           a way that desirable conveniences are not neglected and living is rendered practical
                           and pleasant. The usefulness of a small dwelling depends more on the arrangement and
                           interrelationship of the various rooms than on their size.

                           have started to help people make their homes again the center of family life. They
                           are carefully considering the habits of the people, the planning of the rooms, and
                           the budgeting of the furnishings. Few of the families who will be fortunate enough
                           to live in the new houses will have adequate furniture when they move from their present
                           quarters. They will have to be assisted in arranging their new surroundings. They
                           must get out with a very limited budget, but that is no handicap. It may prove of
                           advantage, when understanding and a well trained staff s available for advice.

                           at little or no cost. With paint, color, arrangement, and a little assistance and
                           care, every place could be made a home in which all could be happy and to which the

                           by members to be put on sale. They plan to keep the paintings for about five months.
                           For two or three years, this Museum has had similar loan exhibits from organizations
                           in New York and Philadelphia.

                        <p id="d7263e1017">Ana is a young business woman who likes to drop in at the Art Museum of a Saturday
                           morning. To prove that even within those austere walls there is room for humour and
                           imagination, we relate a few of her experiences there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1020">It began with the Daumier Show. Ana, always impatient with self-conscious culture,
                           was annoyed by a supercilious couple who walked around laboriously reading the captions
                           in French and translating them literally without the faintest appreciation of their
                           humour. Ana herself, familiar with French, let out loud guffaws before each drawing,
                           which caused the couple to disapprove of her as heartily as she disapproved of them.
                           Finally she planned a coup that staggered them. Standing very close as they scrutinized
                           a cartoon, she said loudly to her companion, “Geeze,—these are just like The New Yorker,
                           ain’t they?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1023">The erudite couple edged away as from a leper.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1027">The first time Ana went to look at the Cezanne “Baigneuses”, she took a chair from
                           a guard and sat before the painting for an hour. It wasn’t that the picture itself
                           held her entranced for so long a time, but this seemed like a comfortable place to
                           catch up on some contemplative thought. Comfortable—except for one disturbing factor—she
                           was annoyed by the modern buffet which is placed below the painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1030">The following Saturday she returned to the spot and again asked the guard for a chair.
                           He looked at her a little suspiciously and she knew that he remembered her as the
                           girl who had sat so long before the Cezanne. She sat awhile ever more annoyed with
                           the buffet, upon which the Cezanne almost seems to rest, then she went off to visit
                           other favorite corners of the museum.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1033">Before leaving, she came back for one more look at “The Bathers.” The guard had removed
                           her chair, but came up to her at once to ask if she wanted it again. Straightway she
                           determined to add a bit of spice to his monotonous existence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1036">“Zank you. Oui.” She said, and sat down. She stared intently at the painting for several
                           minutes, then arose and with clenched fists fairly screamed at the guard, “Zat buffet—eet
                           eez eempossible!” She stamped out of the room in apparent fury.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1039">WAR SCARE</p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1042">Once Ana was standing alone in the rather dim corner of a room to which some beautiful
                           old Chinese vases had recently been moved.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1046">A Japanese man entered the room, and without hesitating to look around, walked directly
                           up to the vases and lifted his hands above them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1049">Her heart stopped. Surely he was about to shatter these priceless objects in a barbarous
                           burst of patriotism.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1052">But the impression lasted only an instant. The gentleman caressed the vases lovingly
                           and reverently, barely touching them with his hands, then left the room as abruptly
                           as he had entered it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1055">Little did we realize our own strength when we opened our offices in the Central Medical
                           Building. After barely three months of occupancy, we were not a little surprised (as
                           well as shocked) to find the entrance of the building entirely renovated a l’art moderne.
                           Whether this happy result was caused by our artistic occupancy we do not know, but
                           at this writing we are slapping our own backs vigorously.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1058">Our reporter asked Sam Spielman how things were going these days. “See that,” said
                           Sam, pointing to an almost completed self-portrait.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1061">“Not bad,” mused our reporter.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1065">“Not bad!” exploded Sam.</p>

                        <p id="d7263e1117">Work on Snow White began early in 1935 when three hundred artists were given trials.
                           Of the twenty five eastern artists only twelve made good. The trial, lasting three
                           months, was as follows.

                           of line, the weight of the model’s hips, the pull and strength of her shoulder as
                           she rested on her arm.

                           second month was spent in the animation of simple problems, such as a bouncing ball,
                           a flag waving in the breeze, etc. Here we encountered difficulties. Everyone knows
                           that a ball flattens out a bit when it is bounced, and we had taken that into consideration
                           in our drawings. But on the screen tests the ball seemed to stick to the ground momentarily
                           instead of immediately bouncing up again. When we drew the ball flat as a pancake
                           for one frame, then back to normal again, the desired effect was attained.

                           five hundred drawings, yet lasting only ten seconds on the screen. To a moviegoer
                           Mickey cut a pole with an axe. To the animator the job was this:

                        <p id="d7263e1135">First, the line of action must be determined. In other words, in what precise way
                           was Mickey to swing the axe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1138">Next was the anticipation—the detail letting the audience know Mickey is going to
                           cut the pole.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1141">Then comes the action—Mickey swings the axe over his shoulder, comes down with a swift
                           stroke—then whirls around from the impact of the blow, giving the reaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1144">Well known to Philadelphians is Emidio “Mike” Angelo, who worked for Walt Disney in
                           his New York studio. Mr. Angelo has had cartoons and caricatures in the Philadelphia
                           Ledger, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Saturday Evening Post, Collier’s, College Humor
                           and other publications. He is a former student of the Pennsylvania Academy, having
                           won two European scholarships. Painting is his hobby, and he has exhibited at the
                           Art Club, the Sketch Club, the Art Alliance and the Pennsylvania Academy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1147">There are three departments in the Disney Studio—the story department, where ideas
                           are drawn instead of written—second are the master animators who make the beautiful
                           key drawings, and these drawings are connected by the assistant animators. So far
                           all the work has been done in pencil. The pencil drawings are finally turned over
                           to a third staff of girls who do the inking in and coloring.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1150">Ironically enough, the final results are not due to the drawings, but to mechanics
                           and physics. Due to this fact the artists attend school three evenings a week (Disney’s
                           there too) in order to devise methods of overcoming mechanical difficulties.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1154">Walt Disney strives always for perfection. For instance, in Snow White all of the
                           dwarfs have wrinkles on their foreheads but one—and that one is Happy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1157">When Disney and his men saw the first rushes of Snow White they realized that the
                           action was too jerky and that the film lacked precision. When the figures in the drawings
                           were expanded from the original two and a quarter inches to eighteen inches, it was
                           discovered that the animators had greater latitude in developing expressions. In the
                           small drawings a line that varied one hundredth of an inch from the preceding picture
                           created a jerky movement which was noticeable in the early sequences of Snow White
                           but is absent in the final shots.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1160">In the making of Snow White, seven midgets were employed by the studio. These midgets
                           posed for the study and observation of the artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1163">Disney will continue to present to the world other full length films, among them “The
                           Adventures of Pinocchio” and “Bambi”. He will also present a seven minute film, “The
                           Sorcerer’s Apprentice”, the musical score written by Leopold Stokowski. Although we
                           all admire the films as they are presented, I feel sure that an exhibition of the
                           original drawings as executed by the artists would be of as much interest and attract
                           as many of the public as the Van Gogh exhibition.

                        <p id="d7263e1183">The young, little-known portrait painter, Felix Tate, who worked in an individual
                           style, called one day to pay his respects to Crowell Render, an old, successful, and
                           strictly conservative portraitist. The old gentleman enjoyed a reputation of honor
                           and distinction. He was president of the weightiest art organization in the town,
                           served on important juries, and was patronized by the Great of that region.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1186">The old man was cordial and friendly towards the young painter, making agreeable comments
                           on an example of his work of which he had seen a reproduction. The young man, in turn,
                           found nice things to say about the elder’s academicisms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1189">Having shown Felix several canvasses in his studio, Crowell Render suggested that
                           they go to see a portrait of a brother of Madame Dickerflit by Augustus John. Madame
                           Dickerflit was certain that the author of the portrait was of assured reputation.
                           Furthermore a large sum of money had been paid for it. Also, it had been painted abroad.
                           There was no doubt in her mind but that Crowell Render would applaud her taste, altho
                           secretly she found the picture hard to understand.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1192">Crowell Render arrived with Felix Tate and generously introduced the young man as
                           “a distinguished young portrait painter”. Madame Dickerflit ushered them in to her
                           living room where John’s work hung opposite the doorway. Felix was immediately impressed
                           by its vivid interpretive quality He was lost in contemplation of its expressiveness
                           when he became aware of the remarks of Crowell Render.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1196">“I can’t understand,” he was saying, “what has happened to John. You know, he used
                           to paint rather well! But he’s grown frightfully careless. Look at that ear, Mr. Tate!
                           It’s at least a half inch too low in the skull. Do you see it?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1199">Felix did see it, and privately considered it unimportant inasmuch as the portrait
                           was very successful in expressing the spirit and character of the sitter. He also
                           saw anxious disappointment conveyed by the mien and posture of Madame Dickerflit.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1202">“And why didn’t he finish it?” Render continued. “I wouldn’t dream of releasing a
                           portrait in that rough-sketch state! Badly drawn and painted! Very careless! Very!
                           Really, Madame Dickerflit, I can’t commend it. Do you agree, Mr. Tate?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1205">“I’m sorry, Mr. Render. I don’t agree. I consider the portrait to be a magnificent
                           example of interpretive painting, and that you,” he bowed to the lady, “are to be
                           congratulated on possessing a great work of art!”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1208">Madame Dickerflit was now completely upset by the disagreement of the two painters.
                           Rather foolishly, she led them to another portrait.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1211">“Oh yes,” said Mr. Render “another of those things by Parrott. Good likeness. Not
                           badly done as a matter of fact. Of course you know, Madame Dickerflit, that Parrott
                           has no standing at all among artists. Nice chap, works hard—but he uses photographs—thoroughly
                           inartistic.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1215">The old man spied a photograph standing on a table. It was a reproduction of a painting
                           of a rich townsman, done by a very famous artist. Mr. Render grunted. “I’ve seen the
                           original of this. Rather good. I’ve painted him too, and I think I caught something
                           in my portrait that was missed in this one . . . Well . . . this has been very pleasant
                           . . . Thank you.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1218">“Apparently,” mused Felix Tate, after he had parted from Crowell Render, “my psychology
                           is all wrong if I am to succeed as a portrait painter.” He chuckled. “In the future
                           no painter will be any good except me!”
                        </p>

                        <p id="d7263e1249">The United States Post Office at Milton, Pa. is an honest presentation of an ever
                           recurring problem The problem is to design a building that seems to live as a vital
                           force in the community in which it is placed; a building that lives with dignity and
                           simplicity as it serves the people that surround it. This is not as simple as it sounds.
                           Many examples of little “Greek” abound in communities in which they have not the slightest
                           relation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1253">An inscription in the Lobby shows the historical background of the community of Milton.
                           In part it reads, “The first Post Office was established here in the year 1799.” Although
                           Mr. Sternfeld followed no traditional lines in designing the building, he has suggested
                           in a simple way, early American, by means of the fluted pilastered panels flanking
                           the entrance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1256">Mr. Sternfeld said, “Economy was a paramount consideration. The amount of ornament
                           and carving had to be minimized. It was therefore concentrated around the entrance.
                           At the time of the erection of the building there was a regulation forbidding the
                           name of the town to be placed on the Post Office Building. To give the building identity,
                           the panel above the entrance door was designed as a relief map in bronze showing the
                           town of Milton and its immediate vicinity. Superimposed upon the map is a bronze plaque
                           showing the great seal of the United States, around which are arranged medallions
                           indicating the various regions of the earth to which mail is sent.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1259">The title of the building is carved over the main entrance. Flanking this are two
                           heroic sculptures showing Indians sending messages by day and night. Since the Post
                           Office is located directly upon the Susquehanna Trail, it was felt that such sculpture
                           representing means of communication before white settlers arrived was particularly
                           appropriate.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1262">All of this shows Mr. Sternfeld’s sincerity in wanting to make this Post Office a
                           part of the community, not only in function but in form and detail. In the accomplishment
                           of this purpose he was aided most sympathetically by Louis Milione who executed all

                        <p id="d7263e1265">Upon questioning Mr. Sternfeld concerning his reason for placing the Entrance to one
                           end, I discovered that ideal function called for it and that even in this particular
                           he would not follow the traditional center door if it did not apply.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1268">He told me, “The entrance was placed at one end of the lobby in order to simplify
                           the circulation of the public and to eliminate as far as possible drafts of cold air
                           during the winter months. This arrangement also permits the addition of a similar
                           entrance at the opposite end of the lobby should the future warrant expansion, enabling
                           the public approaching from either direction to easily enter the building.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1272">There is a sincerity of approach and a sympathetic understanding of the problem in
                           the design of this little Post Office, as there is in all of Mr. Sternfeld’s work.
                           We most highly commend it.

                           <p id="d7263e1304">After getting my one picture of Queen Marie off to America, I turned my attention
                              to the coming Olympic Games. To my way of thinking, the important thing to do was
                              to get some exclusive beat in advance, if possible. Everybody would be sending in
                              pictures of the actual games and they would be published in America at least a week
                              after the events had taken place, and results cabled and published seven days before
                              certainly would take the edge off those pictures. I figured that the great American
                              long distance team was tops in interest, so I laid my plans accordingly. I made arrangements
                              with a member of the French Olympic Committee to keep me constantly posted on the
                              arrival of all teams and where they were to be quartered. Of course everybody was
                              on hand to welcome the S. S. America when it steamed into Cherbourg with the vanguard
                              of America’s athletic contingent. Jack Kelly, our famous rowing champion, shouted
                              a cheery invitation from the deck rail and I was soon stowing away a good old fashioned
                              American breakfast aboard ship with Jack and the rest of his brawny oarsmen. Everybody
                              made lots of pictures, but the long distance team was not aboard and that was the
                              outfit I was waiting for.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1307">At last one morning I got word that they had arrived and were staying at a hotel on
                              the Champs Elysees near the Etoile. I lost no time in getting there and seeking out
                              their manager. He told me they were going for a workout in the Bois at high noon.
                              I asked him to have them leave the hotel in their running clothes and run the short
                              distance from there to the Bois. I told him I wanted to get a picture of the boys
                              rounding the Arc de Triomphe so I could send a picture home showing them in a real
                              Paris setting. He thought that would be a good idea, so at noon they sprinted along
                              the Champs Elysees and flashed around the Etoile right through the traffic while I
                              shot away at them from the opened top of a darting taxi. A boat train was leaving
                              early the next morning and I knew if the other syndicates didn’t show up with their
                              cameras soon I had the jump on them. They didn’t, and late that afternoon I strolled
                              into the Trib office to develop my plates. They were swell, showing the whole team
                              loping through the traffic, French taxis, blue-cloaked police, Paris busses, and the
                              Arc de Triomphe towering in the background. As I came out of the darkroom, Jack Chapman
                              asked me if I had heard anything of the long distance team.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1310">“I heard they arrived,” he said, “and I want to find out where they’re staying. I’m
                              afraid the Times Wide World might get ahead of me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1313">“Sure, I know where they’re staying,” I said, and told him. He looked at me suspiciously.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1317">“What are you developing?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1320">“I’ll show you,” I grinned, and held up a dripping plate.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1323">Jack turned a bit green. “Is that picture exclusive?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1326">“You bet. Nobody else got anything.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1329">“There’s no use asking you for an extra plate of it if it’s exclusive,” said Jack
                              tentatively.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1332">“You can shoot ’em tomorrow,” I allowed.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1336">“Yeah . . . there’s a boat train early tomorrow morning too.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1339">“Mine’ll be on that,” I smiled.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1342">“Well anyway, the Times Wide World won’t trim me—” and Jack dashed off for the Champs
                              Elysees. But too late . . . I had my beat.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7263e1345">This picture was timely as it appeared in the rotogravures just before the Olympic
                              Games started. During the games the American photographers pooled their pictures,
                              all taking their turns covering the events as only a limited number of passes were
                              issued—at a price. This price was taken up and paid jointly by all the American newspapers
                              and syndicates represented there. Covering the games therefore became more or less
                              a matter of routine with competition eliminated.

                              lay on the counter at Meil’s. It’s still the main source of inspiration to many a
                              commercial illustrator. It’s a beautiful job and its glossy pages are filled with
                              splendid examples of the work the big boys are doing on the major accounts. The work
                              of several Philadelphians is shown, including Stuart Graves’ opus which won an award.

                              in a dignified manner. No note of unseemly levity is ever permitted in advertising
                              such highly utilitarian objects. Once in a great while there are lighter moments,
                              such as the swell job Harry Ayers did or a trade paper for the Darling Valve and Gasket
                              Company. The company commemorated its fiftieth anniversary with one of Harry’s efforts,

                           <p id="d7263e1520">At lunch last Wednesday, the conversations at the Sketch Club turned to some of the
                              colorful figures who have labored in the local commercial art field in the past. One
                              individual, who lingered in our midst about twelve years ago, according to Frank Ewing,
                              had all the attributes of something akin to genius. A long, rangy fellow he looked
                              as though he might have stepped out of a novel on Kentucky in the days of the long
                              rifle. He was, in common parlance, a card. Turning to advertising as a means of self
                              support, he evolved a most unique way of showing his samples. He had acquired an old
                              family album. Red velvet covered and boasting a metal clasp that had to be opened
                              with a tiny key. On interviewing an art director, he would ceremoniously unlock and
                              open to the pages where the family photographs had been replaced by his art work,
                              all of which was drawn by hand. When the seance had ended and the A. D. had mumbled
                              something about keeping him in mind, he would thank him courteously and proceed to
                              lock the album and its precious contents. While he was doing this he would pull the
                              knob of a little drawer in the bottom of his unusual portfolio and a sweetly pitched
                              music box would commence playing. He would walk through the door, album under arm,
                              his whole being the center of merry, tinkling music, even though his heart was breaking.
                              There wasn’t a dry eye in the place.

                           in a lower drawer. With a courtly gesture he reached his hands forward and we put

                           consisted of two years at the School of Industrial Art. Almost immediately, he embarked
                           on a career of commercial art that was interrupted only by a militant interlude during

                           is room enough for both. The photograph’s strength lies in its ability to portray
                           accurately any subject. Take for instance a piece of machinery. Mechanically minded
                           folk might shy at a drawing for fear of intentional distortion. A photograph of the
                           same subject reflects an accuracy of representation and an engineer would, in a sense,
                           get the impression that he would be looking at a faithful reproduction even if it
                           had in some degree been retouched. That in essence is the main virtue of camera work.

                        <p id="d7263e1589">Advertising illustration has gone ahead tremendously, Lane thinks, and a comparison
                           of work done ten or twelve years ago with that done today reflects an improvement
                           almost incredible. Draughtsmanship has been brought to an enviable state of development.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1593">Lane commented upon the various cycles of taste or preferment that have manifested
                           themselves in the past few years. Cartoons were all the rage awhile back and then
                           subsided, only to come back stronger than ever with the strip cartoon advertisement
                           and the increasing number of clients who want that properly balanced dash of humor
                           in their ads.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1596">The old type faces have always claimed his interest, for Lane thinks that the plethora
                           of dazzling and unusual type faces that now sparkle on the typographer’s sample book
                           should be used only for the emphasis an unusual type face can give to a word. His
                           personal preference lies with those perennial favorites, Caslon and Goudy. He likes
                           them because nearly all our books and periodicals have been printed in such type faces
                           as these. Together with Bookman and Bodoni, they have one outstanding feature that
                           Lane believes is paramount,—readability.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1599">Lane is one of the few art directors who is able to keep his hand in by knocking off
                           a batch of comprehensives every now and then. A prodigious worker, he has the enviable
                           ability of remaining calm and unruffled, even under a pressure of work that often
                           turns has office into a well appointed madhouse.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1602">With an unusual variety of accounts to work on he keeps a refreshing amount of sparkle
                           in them by use of different art media. For a hand lotion account, he had some charming
                           mannequins modelled in clay, dressed in the latest vogue and photographed in full
                           color, thus achieving a smartness that would be difficult to get with living models.
                           On an oil account he bought a series of etchings to illustrate some ancient Chinese
                           proverbs. He still gets a lot of fun out of his work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1605">Whenever he has time he likes to build ship models. He purchases any art book that
                           comes out, soaking it up like a blotter, in the hope that it might contain the germ
                           of an idea he could use in a layout. Any new device he comes across is promptly purchased
                           and he grins sheepishly when he admits that he has enough art materials at home, brushes,
                           inks, pencils and pastels, to stock a garrison. He’s been buying them for years, making
                           him a salesman’s dream. Our personal opinion is that he’s getting ready for a revolution.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1608">The apple of Lane’s eye, however, is his brand new beach house at Harvey Cedars, New
                           Jersey. Done in the modern manner, it faces Barnegat Bay and is an ideal spot for
                           a person with a hankering for the sea. He races down there every week-end and goes
                           native with a bang. Living among the sand dunes and salt air, he relaxes utterly and
                           is very proud of the fact that a native once mistook him for a clam-digger.

                        <p id="d7263e1696">During the Christmas holidays I had occasion to be in one of our large department
                           stores and in the course of my peregrinations I had momentarily a most agreeable surprise.
                           On closer inspection that surprise turned into one of righteous anger. What I thought
                           from a distance to be Pennsylvania-Dutch pottery, turned out to be on closer inspection,
                           Mexican ware and none too good a quality at that.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1699">That evening in discussion, I advanced a theory of a revival of the crafts of this
                           section that are as typical as scrapple or the Mummer’s Parade. At once I was asked
                           how this could be started, and promptly answered, “Through the Schools”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1703">Such a thing could be brought about by careful planning on the part of the combined
                           efforts of the Art, Industrial Arts, Music, History and English teachers of a system
                           that has had such a culture in the past. Just as blood is thicker than water—so is
                           that intangible thing we call racial inheritance, a definite part of us. Ancestors
                           who carefully fashioned a slipware pie dish, or an iron dipper, have passed on something
                           to the fingers and minds and souls of their descendants. They may be buried far down
                           under a veneer of “Five and Ten Cent” China or over-stuffed furniture, but they’re
                           there. We see evidences of them cropping up from time to time, and reverently hail
                           such a “phenomenon” as a “primitive” or a “natural”. We fete this fellow and make
                           much of this wonderful thing that is simply as natural to him as breathing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1706">Now I don’t want to flood the market with the work of legions of these primitives
                           that we have unleashed, but I do think that we owe the Spirit of a natural heritage
                           a chance to evince itself in a natural way. There are many aspects to such a movement.
                           The easiest would be to teach the old crafts again and find a market for the product.
                           This is a matter for the teacher combined with the business man. This country is awakening
                           slowly through the efforts of the Federal Government to the fact that there are communities
                           that can do this thing, if given a chance and some support to get them under way.

                        <p id="d7263e1709">Once again schools are indicated and why not the public schools? Are we so hide-bound
                           that we refuse to build a congenial curriculum for a specific locality, or must we
                           conform to a universal pattern? Going along this way we touch the lives of certain
                           individuals who will find pleasing and useful work for life, but you say and rightly;
                           “They can’t all be potters or iron workers or what have you.” No they cannot, but
                           all can participate in a movement to improve a society that at the present time is
                           built up from high pressure sales talks and “keeping up with the Joneses.”

                        <p id="d7263e1712">True values, careful selection useful beauty, all can be taught in the schools. We
                           say that we do these things, and I have no doubt that in many of our minds we are
                           supremely smug in our belief that we have nothing to be afraid of, on this score.
                           I wonder—and so would you if you would stop to look objectively at the work done under
                           your direction.

                           the Pennsylvania-Dutch people. But I see no reason why it could not be applied to
                           all communities. If there is a common denominator for taste it must of a certainty
                           find its beginning in the racial characteristics of the person. How then, dare we
                           offer a set course to a group and expect them all to react in the same way? Surely
                           this problem—vital to the individual must be met I lust be met as individuals—not
                           as groups, not by one teacher, but by all working to a common end.

                           for many of our American traditions was laid, seems the place to cradle such a movement.
                           Why not a native pottery and furniture and ironwork, instead of the imported products
                           of an alien culture? Why not taste in homes and furnishings in keeping with the real
                           feelings within us? Surely the teachers in such communities dare not but give such
                           things serious thought.

                           of Art seldom adventure beyond the vanity of cleverness. Theirs is the macabre dance
                           of an elegant brush in miraculous lines and unctuous masses over glittering surfaces.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7263e1848">Once having discovered his socially effective metier, the clever painter is content

                           vaudeville show. So long as fresh audiences are supplied from the populous world,
                           this dexterous actor gratifies his hungry ego and he prospers. He succeeds, often,
                           throughout a long and conspicuous life.

                           Trick is startling his Tailor imaginative, and his Accent romantic, he will be irresistible.
                           But he probably will not produce works of art.

                        <p id="d7263e1858">Craftsmanship is essentially mechanical. Good craftsmanship in painting embodies good
                           mechanics in construction and chemistry. It means efficient use of materials. It helps
                           to provide brighter and more colorful or more exact results which are lasting.

                        <p id="d7263e1861">Technical proficiency in painting is a much broader term. It requires understanding
                           of the whole language of aesthetics, including craftsmanship, abstract composition,
                           abstract color, and draughtsmanship—with all their nuances of textural differences,
                           apposition of area-shapes and forms, relationship of color intensities, rhythm of
                           line, gesture, and accents with optical darts—and with the ability to use this language
                           for plastic or graphic expression.

                           the most difficult feat in art. Any knowledge which makes the flow of Mind to Canvas
                           smoother is worth acquiring. Ideas are not mechanical, but our eyes and heads and
                           paint and brushes are. It is a form of intellectual provincialism to assume that artistic
                           creation will solve its own mechanical problems by a divine miracle.

                        <p id="d7263e1867">Craftsmanship can be unaesthetic, but every aesthetic master-piece must employ craftsmanship
                           of some sort.

                        <p id="d7263e1870">Most of us have been ushered into our artistic careers with a pitifully inadequate
                           experience with the mechanical possibilities of plastic and graphic expression. With
                           regrettable loyalty to our teachers or with plain laziness in our thinking we continue
                           within a narrow scope to produce works which may not even approach our latent capabilities.
                           Some of us spend our lives working out technical problems in color or in abstract
                           composition; some strive to “make it like”; most of us merely dawdle; combined, we
                           produce the trivialisms which are called Art.

                        <p id="d7263e1874">Very often it is a short step from habitual practice to a new expedient which would
                           actually bring Mind to Canvas and make the difference between a passably good piece
                           of work and one which really comes off. That little step is physically easy if supported
                           by mental alertness, courage, and humble concentration on artistic expression.

                           as a Bougereau, shocking in contrast with his surrealist essays so frequently seen.
                           Photographically, we were extremely impressed with a nude by Florence Henri, while
                           the alpine shot by Gos is a most striking study of great jagged rock formations. Blumenfield
                           has created some extremely sensitive plates, using a soft focus, as is his custom,
                           and producing plates that become far more than mere photographs.

                           of the Subject in Sculpture and Painting” M. Gide knows HIS “subject” as well as the
                           problems which confront the modern painter today.

                        <p id="d7263e2038">We quote: “What subject can there be for modern painting? No doubt an artist such
                           as Maurice Denis can still paint Madonnas and Annunciations, and decorate the chapel
                           of Vesinet with scenes of piety; but this Christian inspiration which in him is sincere,
                           would be a hypocritical affectation assumed to order in many others. Shall they then
                           have recourse to Greek legend? No doubt the pagan myths offer an unlimited field;
                           but the greater number of contemporary artists are turned away from fiction by the
                           exigencies of realism.”

                           than words. I talked with Benners about her decoration and it is good to hear she
                           has successfully completed it. I also chatted with Emlen Etting of the art school,
                           he was about to start and see that is accomplished—better still, there is a reproduction
                           of his work enclosed. Enjoyed also Taylor’s paint craft and in a more personal way
                           was interested in the adjectives describing my show at the Plastic Club. When shall

                           valuable and also that of Mr. Martino. The latter and the one in the December issue

                           to call on my friend, Mrs. Coppedge. She gave me the one containing Mr. Breckenridge’s,
                           as she knew of our having been friends at the P. A. F. A., and also that I’d studied

                           blasts. . . . Isn’t the Museum generally conceded to belong to an almost different
                           era of architectural consciousness? After all, it is nearly twenty years old and viewpoints
                           have undergone a tremendous change! Today it would surely be built along other lines.
                           But, since we have the museum as it stands, the more important question seems ‘what
                           can be done with it?’ (There is no use in ‘blowing up’ the Arqive Wooden Horse because
                           he faced Troy lacking a streamline radiator and pneumatic brakes.) Surely a little
                           attention would remedy the glaring windows from within the Museum. And if people insist
                           upon knowing what Greek inscriptions mean informed guides or better still a translation
                           in luminous paint could balance our debt to tradition. And it is also important (if
                           we are to insist upon absolute functionalism) to streamline our consciousness to the
                           extent of being able to discover what is lacking or amiss with the ‘functioning’ of
                           our economic structure. There is more to our environment than unsatisfactory buildings!
                           And even the staunchest—the most fanatical purist will admit, I believe, that despite
                           the defects in appearance it is still more fun to enter the Museum than to go into
                           the Post Office. We must of course anticipate the appearance of new museums but we
                           should also enjoy the possibilities of the present structure.”
