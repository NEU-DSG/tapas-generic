                        <p id="d2e282">IT is said of Mr. Burke that he could take a survey of the political
                           sky and tell the destiny of nations for twenty years to come. Judge
                           TUCKER has literally done this, as far as the American people are
                           concerned, as will be found strikingly illustrated in the work before us.
                           Written and published in 1836, but bearing in its imprint the date of
                           1856, and intended as a tale of the future, applying to the intervening
                           period, it has substantially foretold the great leading features of the
                           history of the twenty-five years intervening between the time of its first
                           publication, and this eventful era, at which it is again given to the public.

                        <p id="d2e285">In following the history of the hero through the strange vicissitudes
                           of love, and war, and wild adventure—glowing now with the roseate
                           tinge of sentiment, and, anon, with the fiery hue of tragedy, the reader
                           will be amazed to see the 
                           <hi id="d2e287" style="font-style: italic;">incidental</hi> mention of the great historical facts
                           which have, in the last eighteen months, marked the disintegration of
                           a vast republic, and the organization and struggles of a new one. The
                           secession of the more Southern States—the formation of the “Southern
                           Confederacy”—the hesitation of Virginia—the arguments which
                           fifteen months ago resounded, from the Chesapeake to the Ohio in favour
                           of her seceding and “accepting the invitation to join the Southern
                           Confederacy”—the “pretext” on which the Northern army 
                           <hi id="d2e290" style="font-style: italic;">was</hi>
                           raised; “the apprehension of hostilities from the Southern Confederacy”—
                           the war—the effects of the blockade, even to its influence upon
                           the article of common salt, etc., etc., seem as familiar to the pen of the
                           great political seer, as if he had 
                           <hi id="d2e293" style="font-style: italic;">actually</hi> been a participant “in the
                           great struggle” which he writes, “I witnessed and partook.”

                        <p id="d2e297">The reader will realize, perhaps, more amusement, though less of
                           wonder, to see as thorough appreciation of Yankee character, as well in
                           small things and in great, as the lights and shadows of twenty-five
                           additional years of peace and war afford. “He 
                           <hi id="d2e299" style="font-style: italic;">surely</hi> had read some of
                           McClellan's reports,” was the playful remark of an intelligent friend,
                           as we read the account of Col. Trevor's defeat, and his official report,
                           which “lies like truth, and yet most truly lies.”

                        <p id="d2e304">Indeed, so marvellously does the book apply to recent and current
                           events, that sometimes sketching its striking passages, with those who
                           were not readers contemporaneous with its first circulation, they have

                           <hi id="d2e308" style="font-style: italic;">looks</hi> like an old book, as that, by an unpleasant association
                           of ideas, I have almost fancied myself suspected as a sort of Thomas
                           Chatterton, with his affected old Saxon style, and black-lettered, artificially-
                           blurred volumes, attempting to impose on the literary world.
                           Many, however, will hail it as an old friend, whose eccentricities once
                           served to amuse their idle hours; but treated at best with neglect, had
                           withdrawn, and so secluded himself, that when by experience, they discover
                           that “his folly was wiser than their wisdom,” comes not

                           was. Indeed, that the public has remained in doubt to a very

                           from the 
                           <hi id="d2e327" style="font-style: italic;">Southern Literary Messenger</hi> of June 1861. The editor,

                           in the North, taken from the Baltimore 
                           <hi id="d2e330" style="font-style: italic;">Exchange</hi>, says: “We
                           see that some of our exchanges have given credit to the novel in

                           bursting of the ‘Peacemaker;’ but we

                                 <p id="d2e355">DEAR SIR—I have received yours of the 30th ult., asking me to give you
                                    any information I possess as to the authorship of a book called “The Partisan
                                    Leader.” The late Judge Beverley Tucker, of Williamsburg, was the author
                                    of the work; and the first time I ever heard him declare he wrote the book
                                    was under the following circumstances: In 1842 or 43, I do not now remember
                                    the precise period, the Hon. J. M. Botts accused the late Judge A. P. Upshur,
                                    in a printed communication, of being a disunionist, and among other
                                    items of evidence brought forward by Mr. Botts to sustain this charge, as well
                                    as I now recollect, it was insinuated that Judge Upshur was the author of
                                    “The Partisan Leader.” This controversy excited a good deal of interest in
                                    Williamsburg, where Judge Upshur had many warm friends and admirers. I
                                    was at that time a student of William and Mary College, and a member of
                                    Judge Tucker's class, and on this occasion I heard him declare to his class
                                    that he wrote the book and was responsible for whatever sins or heresies it
                                    contained. This was the first time I ever heard him refer to the subject. After
                                    this I heard him refer to it frequently in private. I have often heard him
                                    <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e357"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="4" data-tei-n="v"> </a></span>
                                    say that those who were then deriding him, and denouncing his book as a
                                    treasonable production would live to see the day when they would acknowledge
                                    that his appreciation of the Yankee character was correct; and lament
                                    in tears and blood that his views were not sooner adopted by the South. It
                                    was written by its great author to open the eyes of Virginia and the South to
                                    the dangers which he so clearly saw just ahead, and which we all have so
                                    keenly felt. Well, well, would it have been could all have seen as he did.

                           where he proposed to lay the scene of one of his novels.

                        <p id="d2e381">“No,” said the great word-painter, “soon your stock of litchen and
                           daises would be exhausted, and you must become monotonous; but adhere
                           to nature, and you will have the variety of nature.”

                           that the principal scene of the story was laid in Patrick county,
                           Va., I determined to make a pilgrimage to the now classic region of
                           “the Devil's Backbone.” On arriving at the court-house, I was informed
                           that just such a locality as that described, formerly known by
                           that name, but now more familiarly known as “Witt's Spurr,” was to
                           be found in that wildest of mountain ranges, which rises in rugged grandeur
                           six miles west of the village. I also learned, through the courtesy
                           of that accomplished gentleman, Hon. W. R. Staples; of the Confederate
                           Congress, that in 1820 or 25, Judge Tucker paid a visit to
                           that region, and in company with 
                           <hi id="d2e387" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> father, a soldier friend in the war
                           of 1812, spent a day rambling over the mountains; and further, that
                           “Witt” was a 
                           <hi id="d2e390" style="font-style: italic;">real</hi>
                           character, and was probably now to be found somewhere
                           not distant from the scene where the author first introduces him.
                           Veering southward on the North Carolina road, first of all to search out
                           this old hero, at a distance of about three miles from the Court-house,
                           I rode up to an humble dwelling on the left, without thought of else
                           than enquiring the way, when an old woman, so large, so out-spoken
                           and hard-sensed, reported herself in response to the call, and gave the
                           desired directions, that it occurred at once to my mind, this would be
                           a worthy help meet of that “large, powerful man, of untaught wisdom,
                           Christian Witt.” The following colloquy occurred:

                           the wide, wild gorge, with its difficult approaches of steep precipice, and

                        <p id="d2e537">A word of personal explanation, and I am done. My attention
                           being called to the work by the notice alluded to, in the 
                           <hi id="d2e539" style="font-style: italic;">Literary Messenger</hi>,
                           some twelve months since, I had felt the intensest curiosity to
                           read and compare it with the momentous events of the present crisis,
                           but had found my inquiries vain during that period, and had despaired
                           of obtaining my object. A few weeks since, however, in the regular
                           routine of duty, by a happy accident I blundered upon it. Amazed,
                           and gratified in finding it a greater literary curiosity than I had even
                           supposed, it immediately occurred to me that thousands must realize a
                           similar interest with myself in its perusal; and that while its republication
                           was due alike to the fame of its author and to historical propriety,
                           its general circulation would tend to illustrate the necessity of
                           our position, to vindicate the justice of our cause, and to intensify
                           Southern patriotism. Astonished that it had not been republished, I
                           determined that if others would not undertake the work, with the approval
                           of those who have the first right to represent the author and his
                           interests, I would myself engage in the enterprise. Deferring as far
                           as practicable to these, I was assured that they were desirous of its
                           republication, and had once made arrangements for it; but owing to the
                           fall of Norfolk the work had been estopped in that direction, and that
                           I could therefore feel free to go forward with it. Pleased that I am
                           permitted, 
                           <hi id="d2e542" style="font-style: italic;">in a manner consonant with the proprieties of the case</hi>, thus
                           to minister, as I humbly conceive, at once to the public gratification
                           and the public good, I commit the great work, in its original form, to
                           its own vindication, trusting to the intelligence of the reader to apply
                           the coincidences which mark its fulfillment as a political prophecy.

                           <p id="d2e589">TOWARD the latter end of the month of October, 1849, about the
                              hour of noon, a horseman was seen ascending a narrow valley at the
                              eastern foot of the Blue Ridge. His road nearly followed the course of
                              a small stream, which, issuing from a deep gorge of the mountain,
                              winds its way between lofty hills, and terminates its brief and brawling
                              course in one of the larger tributaries of the Dan. A glance of the eye
                              took in the whole of the little settlement that lined its banks, and measured
                              the resources of its inhabitants. The different tenements were
                              so near to each other as to allow but a small patch of arable land to
                              each. Of manufactures there was no appearance, save only a rude shed
                              at the entrance of the valley, on the door of which the oft-repeated
                              brand of the horse shoe gave token of a smithy. There, too, the rivulet,
                              increased by the innumerable springs which afforded to every habitation
                              the unappreciated, but inappreciable luxury of water, cold, clear
                              and sparkling, had gathered strength enough to turn a tiny mill. Of
                              trade there could be none. The bleak and rugged barrier, which
                              closed the scene on the west, and the narrow road, fading to a footpath,
                              gave assurance to the traveller that he had here reached the 
                              <foreign id="d2e591" xml:lang="lat">ne
                                 plus ultra
                              </foreign> of social life in that direction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e595">Indeed, the appearance of discomfort and poverty in every dwelling
                              well accorded with the scanty territory belonging to each. The walls
                              and chimneys of unhewn logs, the roofs of loose boards laid on long
                              rib-poles, that projected from the gables, and held down by similar
                              poles placed above them, together with the smoked and sooty appearance
                              of the whole, betokened an abundance of timber, but a dearth of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e597"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span>
                              everything else. Contiguous to each was a sort of rude garden, denominated,
                              in the ruder language of the country, a “truck patch.”
                              Beyond this lay a small field, a part of which had produced a crop of
                              oats, while on the remainder the Indian corn still hung on the stalk,
                              waiting to be gathered. Add to this a small meadow, and the reader
                              will have an outline equally descriptive of each of the little farms
                              which, for the distance of three miles, bordered the stream.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e600">But, though the valley thus bore the marks of a crowded population,
                              a deep stillness pervaded it. The visible signs of life were few.
                              Of sounds there were none. A solitary youngster, male or female,
                              alone was seen loitering about every door. These, as the traveller
                              passed along, would skulk from observation, and then steal out, and,
                              mounting a fence, indulge their curiosity, at safe distances, by looking
                              after him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e604">At length he heard a sound of voices, and then a shrill whistle, and
                              all was still. Immediately, some half a dozen men, leaping a fence,
                              ranged themselves across the road and faced him. He observed that
                              each, as he touched the ground, laid hold of a rifle that leaned against
                              the enclosure, and this circumstance drew his attention to twenty or more
                              of these formidable weapons, ranged along in the same position. The
                              first impulse of the traveller was to draw a pistol; but seeing that the
                              men, as they posted themselves, rested their guns upon the ground and
                              leaned upon them, he quietly withdrew his hand from his holster. It
                              was plain that no violence was intended, and that this movement was
                              nothing but a measure of precaution, such as the unsettled condition of
                              the country required. He therefore advanced steadily but slowly, and,
                              on reaching the party, reined in his horse and silently invited the intended
                              parley.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e607">The men, though somewhat variously attired, were all chiefly clad in half-dressed
                              buck-skin. They seemed to have been engaged in gathering corn
                              in the adjoining field. Their companions, who still continued the same
                              occupation, seemed numerous enough (including women and boys, of
                              both of which there was a full proportion,) to have secured the little
                              crop in a few hours. Indeed, it would seem that the whole working
                              population of the neighborhood, both male and female, was assembled
                              there.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e610">As the traveller drew up his horse, one of the men, speaking in a
                              low and quiet tone, said, “We want a word with you, stranger, before
                              you go any further.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e613">“As many as you please,” replied the other, “for I am tired and
                              hungry, and so is my horse; and I am glad to find some one, at last, of
                              whom I may hope to purchase something for both of us to eat.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e618">“
                              <hi id="d2e620" style="font-style: italic;">That</hi> you can have quite handy,” said the countryman; “for we
                              have been gathering corn, and were just going to our dinner. If you
                              will only just 'light, sir, one of the boys can feed your horse, and you
                              can take such as we have got to give you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e625">The invitation was accepted; the horse was taken in charge by a
                              long-legged lad of fifteen, without hat or shoes, and the whole party
                              crossed the fence together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e628">At the moment, a man was seen advancing toward them, who,
                              observing their approach, fell back a few steps, and threw himself on the
                              ground at the foot of a large old apple-tree. Around this were clustered
                              a motley group of men, women and boys, who opened and made
                              way for the stranger. He advanced, and bowing gracefully, took off
                              his forage cap, from beneath which a quantity of soft, curling flaxen
                              hair fell over his brow and cheeks. Every eye was now fixed on him,
                              with an expression rather of interest than mere curiosity. Every countenance
                              was serious and composed, and all wore an air of business, except
                              that a slight titter was heard among the girls, who, hovering behind
                              the backs of their mothers, peeped through the crowd to get a look
                              at the handsome stranger.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e631">He was indeed a handsome youth, about twenty years of age, whose
                              fair complexion and regular features made him seem yet younger. He
                              was tall, slightly but elegantly formed, with a countenance in which
                              softness and spirit were happily blended. His dress was plain and cheap,
                              though not unfashionable. A short grey coat, waistcoat and pantaloons,
                              that neatly fitted and set off his handsome person, showed by the quality
                              of the cloth that his means were limited, or that he had too much sense
                              to waste in foppery that which might be better expended in the service
                              of his suffering country. But, even in this plain dress, he was
                              apparelled like a king in comparison with the rustics that surrounded
                              him; and his whole air would have passed him for a gentleman in any
                              dress and any company where the constituents of that character are
                              rightly understood.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e634">In the present assembly there seemed to be none, indeed, who could
                              be supposed to have had much experience in that line. But dignity is
                              felt, and courtesy appreciated by all, and the expression of frankness
                              and truth is everywhere understood.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e637">As the youth approached, the man at the foot of the tree arose and
                              returned the salutation, which seemed unheeded by the rest. He
                              advanced a step or two, and invited the stranger to be seated. This
                              action, and the looks turned toward him by the others, showed that he
                              was in authority of some sort among them. With him, therefore, our
                              traveller concluded that the proposed conference was to be held. There
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e639"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="4"> </a></span>
                              was nothing in his appearance which would have led a careless observer
                              to assign him any pre-eminence; but a second glance might have
                              discovered something intellectual in his countenance, with less of
                              boorishness in his air and manner than the rest of the company displayed.
                              In all, indeed, there was the negative courtesy of that quiet and serious
                              demeanor which solemn occasions impart to the rudest and most frivolous.
                              It was plain to see that they had a common purpose, and that
                              neither ferocity nor rapacity entered into their feeling toward the
                              newcomer. Whether he was to be treated as a friend or an enemy, obviously
                              depended on some high consideration, not yet disclosed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e642">He was at length asked from whence he came, and answered from
                              the neighborhood of Richmond. From which side of the river?
                              From the north side. Did he know anything of Van Courtlandt? His
                              camp was at Bacon's Branch, just above the town. What force had
                              he?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e646">“I cannot say certainly,” he replied, “but common fame made his
                              numbers about four thousand.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e649">“Is that all, on both sides of the river?” said his interrogator.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e652">“O, no! Col. Loyal's regiment is at Petersburg, and Col. Coles's at
                              Manchester—each about five hundred strong; and there is a piquet on
                              the bridge island.”

                           <p id="d2e665">“I can hardly tell,” he replied; “it was at a private ford, several
                              miles above Cartersville.”

                           <p id="d2e671">“It was safer travelling on that side of the river.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e674">“Then the people on that side of the river are your friends?”</p>

                              let me pass, and ask no questions, as long as I travelled due west. On
                              this side, if you are one man's friend, you are the next man's enemy;
                              and I had no mind to answer questions.”

                           <p id="d2e711">“Because the right way to avoid questions is to ask none. So I took

                              I left home.”

                           <p id="d2e717">“Suppose I should tell you,” answered the young man, “that Van
                              Courtlandt had a map of the country made, and gave it to me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e721">“I should say you were a traitor to him or a spy to us,” was the

                           <p id="d2e724">At the same moment a startled hum was heard from the crowd, and
                              the press moved and swayed for an instant, as if a sort of spasm had
                              pervaded the whole mass.
                           </p>

                              “but, without asking a single question, I have found out all I wanted
                              to know.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e730">“And what was that?” asked the other.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e733">“Whether you were friends to the Yorkers and Yankees, or to poor

                           <p id="d2e743">“For OLD VIRGINIA FOREVER,” replied the youth, in a tone in
                              which exultation run through a deeper emotion, that half stifled his
                              voice.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e746">It reached the hearts of his auditors, and was echoed in a shout that
                              pealed along the mountain sides their proud war-cry of “OLD VIRGINIA
                              FOREVER!” The speaker looked around in silence, but with a
                              countenance that spoke all that the voices of his comrades had uttered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e749">“Quiet, boys,” said he, “never shout till the war is ended, unless it
                              be when you see the enemy.” Then turning again to the traveller, he
                              said, “And how did you know we were for old Virginia?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e752">“I knew it by the place where I find you. I heard it in

                              I saw it in 
                              <hi id="d2e757" style="font-style: italic;">their eyes</hi>; and I felt it in 
                              <hi id="d2e760" style="font-style: italic;">my heart</hi>,” said the young man,
                              extending his hand.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e764">His inquisitor returned the cordial pressure with an iron grasp,
                              strong, but not convulsive, a went on: “You are a sharp youth,”
                              said he, “and if you are of the right metal that will hold an edge, you
                              will make somebody feel it. But I don't know rightly yet who that is
                              to be, only just I will say, that if you are not ready to live and die
                              by old Virginia, your heart and face are not of the same color, that's all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e767">He then resumed his steady look and quiet tone, and added, “You
                              must not make me forget what I am about. How 
                              <hi id="d2e769" style="font-style: italic;">did</hi> you learn the
                              way here?”

                           <p id="d2e776">“I can answer that now,” said the youth. “I learned it from Captain
                              Douglas.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e779">“Captain Douglas!” exclaimed the other. “If you were never here
                              before, you have never seen him since he knew it himself.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e782">“True enough,” was the reply, “but I have heard from him.”</p>

                           <p id="d2e798">“Go with me to my horse and I will show you.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e801">The youth, accompanied by his interrogator, now returned toward the
                              fence. Many of the crowd were about to follow; but the chief (for
                              such he seemed) waved them back with a silent motion of his hand,
                              while a glance of meaning at two of the company invited them to proceed.
                              As soon as the stranger reached his horse, he drew out, from
                              beneath the padding and seat of his saddle, a paper closely folded. On
                              opening this, it was found to be a map of his route from Richmond to
                              a point in the mountains, a few miles west of the spot where they stood.
                              On this were traced the roads and streams, with the names of a few
                              places, written in a hand which was known to the leader of the
                              mountaineers to be that of Captain Douglas. A red line marked the devious
                              route the traveller had been directed to pursue.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e804">He said that after crossing the river, between Lynchburg and Cartersville,
                              to avoid the parties of the enemy stationed at both places, he
                              had lain by, until dark, at the house of a true Virginian. Then turning
                              south, and riding hard all night, he had crossed the Appomattox
                              above Farmville, (which he avoided for a like reason,) and, before day,
                              had left behind him all the hostile posts and scouting parties. He soon
                              reached the Staunton river, and having passed it, resumed his westward
                              course in comparative safety.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e807">“You know this hand,” said be to the chief, “and now I suppose

                           <p id="d2e810">“I am satisfied,” replied the other, “and glad to see you. I have
                              not a doubt about you, young man, and you are heartily welcome among
                              us, to all we can give you—and that ain't much—and all we can do
                              for you; and that will depend upon whether stout hearts, and willing
                              minds, and good rifles can help you. But you said you were hungry;
                              so I dare say you'll be glad enough of a part of our sorry dinner.”

                           <p id="d2e839">RETURNING to the party which they had left, they found the women
                              in the act of placing their meal before them under the apple-tree.
                              There was a patch of grass there, but no shade; nor was any needed in
                              that lofty region. The frost had already done its work by stripping
                              the trees of their leaves, and letting in the welcome rays of the sun
                              through the naked branches. The meal consisted of fresh pork and
                              venison, roasted or broiled on the coals, which looked tempting enough,
                              though served up in wooden trays. There were no knives but such as
                              each hunter carries in his belt. Our traveller's dirk supplied the place
                              of one to him. Their plates were truly classical, consisting of cakes of
                              Indian corn, baked in the ashes, so that, like the soldiers of Aenas, each
                              man ate his platter before his hunger was appeased.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e842">Our traveller, though sharp-set, could not help perceiving a woful
                              insipidity in his food, for which his entertainer apologized. “We
                              ha'nt got no salt to give you, stranger,” said he. “The little that's
                              made on the waters of Holston is all used there; and what comes by
                              way of the sound is too dear for the like of us, that fight one half the
                              year and work the other half, and then with our rifles in our hands.
                              As long as we let the Yankees hold James river, we must make up our
                              minds to eat our hogs when they are fat, and to do without salt to our
                              bread. But it is not worth grumbling about; and bread without salt is
                              more than men deserve that will gave up their country without fighting
                              for it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e846">When the meal was finished, our traveller, expressing a due sense of
                              the courtesy of his entertainers, asked what was to pay, and proposed
                              to continue his journey.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e849">“As to what you are to pay, my friend,” said the spokesman of the
                              party, in the same cold, quiet tone, “that is just nothing. If you come
                              here by Captain Douglas's invitation, you are one of us; and if you do
                              not, we are bound to find you as long as we keep you. But, as to your
                              going just yet, it is quite against our rules.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e852">“How is that?” asked the traveller, with some expression of impatience.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e855">“That is what I cannot tell you;” replied the other.</p>

                           <p id="d2e860">“But what right,” exclaimed the youth—then checking himself, he
                              added—“But I see you mean nothing but what is right and prudent;
                              and you must take your own way to find out all you wish to know
                              about me. But I thought you said you did not doubt me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e864">“No more I do,” replied the other; “but that is not the thing
                              May be, our rules are not satisfied, though I am.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e867">“And what are your rules?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e870">“It is against rule to tell them,” said the mountaineer, drily. “But
                              make yourself easy, stranger. We mean you no harm, and I will see
                              and have every thing laid straight before sun-rise. You are heartily
                              welcome. Such as we've got we give you; and that is better than you
                              will find where you are going. For our parts, except it be for salt, we
                              are about as well off here as common; because there is little else we
                              use that comes from foreign parts. I dare say, it will go hard with you
                              for a while sir; but, if your heart's right, you will not mind it, and
                              you will soon get used to it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e873">“It would be a great shame,” said the youth, “if I cannot bear for
                              a while what you have borne for life.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e876">“Yes”, said the other, “that is the way people talk. But (axing
                              your pardon, sir,) there an't no sense in it. Because the longer a man
                              bears a thing, the less he minds it; and after a while, it an't no hardship
                              at all. And that's the way with the poor negroes that the Yankees
                              pretended to be so sorry for, and tried to get them to rise against
                              their masters. There's few of them, stranger, but what's happier than
                              I am; but I should be mighty unhappy, if you were to catch me now,
                              in my old days, and make a slave of me. So when the Yankees want
                              to set the negroes free, and to make me a slave, they want to put us
                              both to what we are not fit for. And so it will be with you for a while,
                              among these mountains, sleeping on the ground, and eating you meat
                              without salt, or bread either, may be. But after a while you will not
                              mind it. But as to whether it is to be long or short, young man, you
                              must not think about that. You have no business here, if you have
                              not made up your mind to stand the like of that for life; and may be
                              that not so mighty long neither.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e879">At this moment a signal from the road gave notice of the approach
                              of a traveller; and the leader of the mountaineers, accompanied by
                              his guest, went forward in obedience to it. But, before he reached
                              the fence, he saw several of the party leap it, and run eagerly forward
                              to meet the new-comer. A little man now appeared, walking slowly
                              and wearily, whose dress differed but little from that of the natives;
                              and who bore, like them, a rifle, with its proper accompaniments of
                              knife, tomahawk, and powder-horn. His arrival awakened a tumult of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e881"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="16" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span>
                              joy among the younger persons present, while he whom I have designated
                              as the chief stood still, looking toward him with a countenance in
                              which an expression of thoughtful interest was mingled with a sort of
                              quiet satisfaction, and great kindness and good will. Yet he moved
                              but a step to meet him, and extending his hand, said, in his usual cold
                              tone, “How is it, Schwartz?” to which the other, in a voice somewhat
                              more cherry, replied, “Well; how is it with you, Witt?” “Well,”
                              was the grave answer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e885">The two now drew apart to converse privately together. Crossing
                              the road, they seated themselves on the fence in front of the stranger,
                              so that during their conference they could keep an eye on him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e888">“Who is this you have got here?” asked Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e891">“A young fellow who says he wants to go to the camp,” replied the
                              other.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e894">“Has he got the word and signs?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e897">“No. He does not know any thing about it. I have a notion he is
                              a friend of the captain's.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e900">“What makes you think so?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e904">“He has got a paper in the captain's hand write to show him the
                              way. But there's no name to it; and if there was, I could not tell
                              that he was the man. Sure and sartin the captain wrote the paper,
                              but then somebody may have stolen it. A man that knows as much
                              about the country as he does, after looking at that paper and travelling
                              by it away here, is the last man we ought to let go any farther, or know
                              any more, unless he is of the right sort.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e907">“I should like to see that paper,” said Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e910">“Here it is,” replied his companion. “I don't much mistrust the
                              young fellow; but I did not like to let him have it again till I knew
                              more.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e913">Schwartz now looked at the paper and enquired the stranger's
                              name.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e916">“I did not ask his name,” said Witt, “because he could just tell
                              me what name he pleased. As there was no name on the paper, it did
                              not make any odds. Besides, I wanted to be civil to him, and your
                              high gentlemen down about Richmond are affronted sometimes if you
                              ask their names. The young fellow is all right, or all wrong, any how;
                              and his name don't make any odds. If the captain knows him, when
                              he sees him, it's all one what his name is.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e919">“But I know,” said Schwartz, “who ought to have that paper; and
                              if he don't answer to that name it's no use troubling the captain with
                              him.”

                           <p id="d2e925">“I should be sorry for any harm to him,” said Witt, “for be is a
                              smart lad; and if he is not a true Virginian, then he is the greatest
                              hypocrite that ever was born.”

                           <p id="d2e928">They now recrossed the road, and Schwartz, addressing the stranger,
                              said, “I must make so bold, young man, as to ask your name.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e931">The young follow colored, and, turning to Witt, said, “I thought
                              you were satisfied, and done asking questions.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e934">“So I was,” said Witt, “but there is a reason for asking your name
                              now, that I did not know of. I owe you nothing but good will, young
                              man,” added he with earnest solicitude; “and if your name is what I
                              hope it is, be sure by all means and tell the truth; for there is but one
                              name in the world that will save your neck.”

                           <p id="d2e937">“Then I shall tell you no name at all,” rejoined the youth, somewhat
                              appalled at this startling intimation. “Why did not you ask me
                              at once, when I was in the humor to keep nothing from you. I was
                              willing to answer any civil question, or indeed any question 
                              <hi id="d2e939" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> would
                              have put to me, but I will not submit to be examined, over and over,
                              by every chance-comer.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e944">“There's where you are wrong, young man,” replied Witt. “This
                              is no chance-comer. He is my head man, and I am just nobody when
                              he is here.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e947">Surprised at this ascription of authority to the diminutive and mean looking
                              new-comer, our traveller looked at him again, and was confirmed
                              in a resolution to resist it. He had patiently borne to be questioned
                              by Witt, who had something of an air of dignity. He was a tall,
                              clean-limbed, and powerful man, of about forty, remarkable for the sobriety
                              of his demeanor, and the thoughtful gravity of his countenance.
                              The other was a little, old fellow, not less than sixty years of age, in
                              whose manner and carriage there was nothing to supply the want of
                              dignity in his diminutive form and features. A sharp, little, black eye
                              was the only point about him to attract attention; and in that the youth
                              thought he saw an impertinent and knowing twinkle, which rendered
                              his inquiries yet more offensive.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e950">“I thought,” said he to Witt, “that Captain Douglas was your
                              captain.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e953">“So he is,” was his reply. “That is, he commands all here. But
                              that is only so long as we choose. I did not tell you this was my 
                              <hi id="d2e955" style="font-style: italic;">captain</hi>.
                              He is no 
                              <hi id="d2e958" style="font-style: italic;">captain</hi>, nor 
                              <hi id="d2e961" style="font-style: italic;">lieutenant</hi>, nor 
                              <hi id="d2e964" style="font-style: italic;">ensign</hi> neither. But all of
                              us here follow him; and, when he is away, the rest follow me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e968">“You all follow 
                              <hi id="d2e970" style="font-style: italic;">him</hi>!” said the traveller, looking contemptuously on
                              the puny figure before him.

                           <p id="d2e977">“To be sure they do,” said Schwartz, with a quizzical smile, and
                              answering the stranger's thoughts. “To be sure they do. Don't you see
                              I am the likeliest man here?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e980">“I cannot say I do” said the youth, offended at the impertinent
                              manner of the question.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e983">“Well, I am the strongest man in the whole company.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e986">“I should hardly think that,” replied the traveller, scornfully.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e989">“Any how, then, I 
                              <hi id="d2e991" style="font-style: italic;">am </hi>the biggest,” rejoined Schwartz, laughing.
                              “That you must own. What! do you dispute that, too? Well, then,
                              look here, stranger! I ha'nt got no commission, and these men are as
                              free as I am. What 
                              <hi id="d2e994" style="font-style: italic;">do</hi> you think make them obey my orders?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e998">“I really cannot say,” replied the young man.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1002">“Well,” said Schwartz, “it is a curious business, and well worth
                              your considering; because, you see, I have a notion if you could find
                              that out, you would find out a pretty good reason why you ought to tell
                              me your name. But that is your business. Some name you must have,
                              and the right one, too. And you see, stranger, it makes no odds
                              whether it is no name or the wrong one. It is all the same thing; because,
                              if you are the man that ought to have that paper, you would tell
                              your name in a minute.”

                           <p id="d2e1005">“Do you know who ought to have it?” asked the youth.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1008">“May be I do,” said Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1011">“Question for question,” said the other. “
                              <hi id="d2e1013" style="font-style: italic;">Do</hi> you know?”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e1024">“That's as it may be,” said Schwartz. “But now I want to know
                              how you came by this paper.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1027">“What need you care about that, if I am the person that ought to
                              have it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1030">“Just because I want to know if you

                              have it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1036">“I tell you,” replied the youth, “that my name is Arthur Trevor.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1039">“But I do not 
                              <hi id="d2e1041" style="font-style: italic;">know</hi> that it is,” replied Schwartz, carelessly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1045">“Do you doubt my word, then?” exclaimed the youth; his eye
                              flashing, and the blood rushing to his face, as if it would burst through
                              his clear skin.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1049">“Look here, stranger,” said Schwartz, in a tone of quiet expostulation;
                              “I don't mean no offence, and you will think so too, if you'll
                              just look at it rightly; because, you see, I don't know who you are. I
                              don't doubt Arthur Trevor's word; and, if you are Arthur Trevor, I
                              don't doubt your word. Now, if you have any way to show that you
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1051"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span>
                              are Arthur Trevor, you have but to do it, and it will set all as straight
                              as if I had axed you ten thousand pardons.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1054">“But I have no means of showing it,” said the young man, in some
                              perplexity. “I took care to bring nothing with me to show who I am.
                              The name of Trevor might have brought me into trouble in some parts
                              of the country.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1057">“That is true enough,” replied Schwartz, “and so I asked you how
                              you came by the paper, because I know how Arthur Trevor should
                              have come by it; and, if you got it that way, why then you are the
                              very man.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1060">By this time the youth saw the folly of his anger, and answered,
                              calmly, that he got it from a man he never saw before.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1063">“What sort of a man was he?” asked Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1066">“Nothing uncommon, except that he was lame.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1070">“Did he give you any thing else at the same time?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1073">“Yes—he gave me this,” said the youth, producing a dirty piece
                              of paper, on which was scrawled these words:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1076">“Sur. If you hav occashun to go of a jurney, carry this with you,

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1079">“Well,” said Schwartz, “that will do. You are Arthur Trevor,
                              sure enough. And I reckon, Witt, you would have said so too, if you
                              had seen this.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1082">Witt looked at the paper, and merely nodded assent.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1085">“Well,” said the young man, “now I suppose I may go to my
                              friend.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1089">“Not just yet,” said Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1092">“Why so?” asked the youth, again relapsing into petulance.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1095">“Just because you could not get there,” was the answer.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1098">“Why not,” said he, “after finding my way thus far.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1101">“For the same reason that you could not have got any farther if I
                              had not come. You would meet with rougher customers than these between
                              here and the camp. Come, come, my son. You must learn to
                              take things easy. The captain has not got a better friend than me in
                              the world; nor you neither, if you did but know all. And, you see,
                              you are going to a new trade; and I thought I would just give you a
                              lesson. Now you may see, that, when you mean nothing but what is
                              fair and honorable, (and 
                              <hi id="d2e1103" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> always know how that is,) the naked truth
                              is your best friend; and then, the sooner it comes the better. I am
                              pretty much of an old fox; and I reckon I have told more lies than
                              you ever dreamed of, but, for all that, I have seen the day when the
                              truth was better than the cunningest lie that ever was told. And then
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1106"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="20" data-tei-n="13"> </a></span>
                              again, it an't no use to mind what a man says when he don't know
                              you; because, you see, it an't you he is talking to, but just a stranger”

                           <p id="d2e1109">“But I have travelled desperate hard to-day, Witt,” continued
                              Schwartz, “and I must push on to the camp to-night. So just give me
                              a mouthful, and I'll be off, and pilot Mr. Trevor through among the
                              guards.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1113">“My horse is at your service, as you are tired,” said Arthur, whose
                              feelings towards his new acquaintance were now quite mollified.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1116">“I have had riding enough for one day,” said Schwartz; “and was
                              glad enough to get to where I could leave my horse. It an't much
                              good a horse will do you, or me either, where we are going. By the
                              time we climb to the top of the Devil's Back-bone, you'll be more tired
                              than me; and the horse will be worst off of any.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1119">He now told one of the boys to make ready Arthur's horse, and,
                              snatching a hasty morsel, seized his rifle. “It will not do,” said he,
                              “to starve when a man is on fatigue, and it will not do to eat too
                              much. And see here, Witt,” added he, taking him apart, and speaking
                              in a low tone, “if a long-legged, red-headed fellow comes along
                              here, and tells you he is from Currituck, and seems to think he knows all
                              the signs, never let him find out but what he does. Only just make
                              an excuse to keep him a while, and send a runner on to me, that I may
                              have time to get out of the way, because he must not see me. Then
                              you can start him off again with a couple of fellows to show him the
                              way.”

                           <p id="d2e1151">THE travellers now moved off together, Arthur walking, and leading
                              his horse. They soon reached a point where a sharp ridge, jutting
                              like a buttress from the side of the mountain, came down abruptly
                              to the very bank of the rivulet. Up this ridge, not unaptly called
                              “the Devil's Back-bone,” the path led. Leaning, as it were, against
                              the mountain—its position, the narrow ridgy edge along which the traveller
                              clambered, and the rough nodules which interrupted the ascent,
                              like the notches in a hen's ladder, gave it no small resemblance to this
                              housewifely contrivance. The steep descent on either hand into deep
                              dells, craggy and hirsute with stinted trees bristling from the sides,
                              together with the similarity of these same nodules to the joints of the
                              spine, had suggested a name strictly descriptive of the place. The
                              ruggedness, steepness, and vast height of the ascent, would naturally
                              provoke some spiteful epithet; and were the spot to be named again,
                              a hundred to one it would receive the same name, and no other.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1154">At the summit of this narrow stair, the travellers stopped to take
                              breath, and look back on the scene below. Arthur, who was at the
                              romantic age when young men are taught to affect an enthusiasm for
                              the beauties of nature, and to prate about hues and scents, and light
                              and shade, and prospects in all the variety of the grand, the beautiful,
                              and the picturesque, had been feasting his imagination with the thought
                              of the glorious view to be soon from the pinnacle before him. Like
                              an epicure about to feast on turtle, who will not taste a biscuit
                              beforehand lest be should spoil his dinner, so our young traveller steadily
                              kept his face toward the hill as he ascended it. Even when he stopped
                              to take breath, he was careful not to look behind. Schwartz, on the
                              contrary, who was in advance, always faced about on such occasions,
                              filling the pauses with conversation, and looking as if unconscious of
                              the glorious scene over which his eye glanced unheeding. Arthur was
                              vexed to see such indifference, and wondered whether this was the
                              effect of use, or of the total absence of a faculty of which poets so
                              much delight to speak.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e1160">At length the summit was attained; and now the youth looked
                              around in anticipated exultation. At first he felt bound to admire,
                              and forgetting the unromantic character of his matter-of-fact companion,
                              exclaimed: “Oh! how grand! How beautiful!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1163">“For my part,” said Schwartz, indifferently, “I cannot say that I
                              see any thing at all rightly, except it be the little branch down there,
                              with its patches of meadow and corn-fields, and its smoky cabins. In
                              the spring of the year, when you cannot see the cabins for the shaders,
                              and the corn, and oats, and meadow is all of a color, it looks mightily
                              like a little green snake. What it is like just now, I cannot say, as I
                              never saw one of them snakes half-scaled, and with a parcel of warts on
                              his back: but I have a notion he would look pretty much so. As to any
                              thing else—there 
                              <hi id="d2e1165" style="font-style: italic;">is</hi> something there, to be sure, but what it is, I am
                              sartain I could never tell, if I did not know. And as to the distance
                              I hear some folks talk about—why the farther you look, the less you
                              see, that's all; until you get away yonder, t'other side of nowhere;
                              and then you see just nothing at all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1169">“But the vastness of the view!” said Arthur. “The idea of immensity!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1172">“As to that,” replied Schwartz, “you have only just to look right
                              up, and you can look a heap farther, and still see nothing. All the
                              difference is, you know it is nothing; and down there, you know there
                              is something, and you cannot see what it is.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1175">“I am afraid your eyes are bad,” said Arthur.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1179">“I cannot see as well as I could once,” replied Schwartz; “but if
                              there was anything to be seen down there, I should be right apt to see
                              it. I have clomb this hill, Mr. Trevor, when I could see the head of
                              a nail in a target fifty yards off, and drive it with my rifle; and I don't
                              think I saw any thing more then than I do now; and that is only just
                              because there an't nothing there to see.—I God! but there is, though!
                              There's that chap a coming along; and I must see the Captain, and
                              tell him all about it before he comes.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1182">“I see nobody,” said Arthur.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1185">“That is because you don't look in the right place,” replied Schwartz.
                              “Look along the road.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1188">“I don't see the road, except just at the foot of the mountain.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1191">“Well! Look through the sights of my rifle. There! Don't you
                              see a man on horseback?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1194">“I see something moving,” said Arthur; but I cannot tell what
                              it is.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1198">“Well,” said Schwartz, “when he comes, you'll see it's a man riding
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1200"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span>
                              on a white horse, and then, may be, you'll think if there was any thing
                              else there, I could see that too.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1203">He now sounded a small whistle, which hung by a leathern throng
                              from his shoulder-belt The signal was answered from the point of a
                              projecting crag which jutted out from the face of the cliff, not more
                              than fifty yards off. At the same moment, a man was seen to rise up
                              from behind a rock, which had hitherto concealed him; though, from
                              his lookout place, he must have had a distinct view of our travellers
                              from the moment they left the valley. He now approached and accosted
                              Schwartz in a manner which showed that he had already recognized
                              him. Schwartz returned the salutation, and, pointing out the
                              man on the white horse, said: “If that fellow should happen to get
                              by without 
                              <hi id="d2e1205" style="font-style: italic;">their</hi> seeing him, I want you just to fall in with him, like
                              as if you was a hunting, and so go with him to the piquet. Never let
                              on but he knows all the signs, and keep with him: and when you get
                              him to the piquet, make him believe that is the camp, and that the
                              Captain will be there after a while; and so keep him there till the
                              Captain comes.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1209">Having said this, he again turned his eye toward the object moving
                              below, and gazed intently for a few minutes. Arthur, in the mean
                              time, was left to admire the prospect, and soon began to suspect that
                              Schwartz's ideas of the picturesque were not so far wrong. Indeed,
                              there is nothing to admire from the spot, but the road that leads to it.
                              From the foot of the mountain to the coast, there is an expanse of
                              nearly three hundred miles, with no secondary ridges. As seen from
                              that elevation, the whole is level to the eye, and presents one sheet of
                              unbroken forest. Arthur found time to correct his preconceptions by the
                              testimony of his own senses, while Schwartz continued to observe the
                              movements of the distant traveller. At last be said: “That will do.
                              They have stopped him; and he will not get away to-night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1212">They now moved on quietly through a forest of lofty chestnuts, and
                              along a path which wound its way among the scorched trunks of innumerable
                              trees, prostrated by the fires that annually sweep through
                              such uninhabited tracts. The soil seemed fertile, and abounding in
                              luxuriant though coarse pasturage; and the high table-land of the
                              mountain was more level than the peopled district below. Yet all was
                              solitary and silent; nor was a vestige of habitation seen for miles. On
                              inquiring the cause of this, Arthur was told that the country, at that
                              elevation, was too cold to be inviting, as nothing would grow there but
                              grass and oats, and that it was all shingled over with conflicting patents.

                           <p id="d2e1215">“They that claim the land,” said Schwartz, “will not go to law about
                              it with one another; because they would have to survey it, and that
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1217"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="17"> </a></span>
                              would cost a mint of money; so they all club to keep it as a summer
                              range for their stock. It belongs to 
                              <hi id="d2e1219" style="font-style: italic;">some</hi> of them and that is enough.”

                           <p id="d2e1223">He had not long done speaking, when he suddenly stopped, and,
                              raising his rifle, fired, and began quietly to load again.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1227">“What did you shoot at?” asked Arthur, looking in the direction of
                              the shot.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1230">“A monstrous fine buck,” replied Schwartz.</p>

                           <p id="d2e1236">“You did not look in the right place. He is down and kicking;
                              and I always like to load my gun before I go up to them, because, you
                              see, a deer, when he is wounded, is as dangerous as a painter.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1239">“A 
                              <hi id="d2e1241" style="font-style: italic;">painter</hi>!” said Arthur. “What harm is there in a painter,
                              more than another man?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1245">“O!” said Schwartz, laughing, “it an't no man at all. I don't just
                              rightly know how you high larnt gentlemen call his name, but he is as
                              ugly a varmint as you'd wish to see; most like a big cat. Sometimes
                              the drotted Yankees gets hold of them and puts them in a cage; and
                              then they call them tigers. I God! I catched a young one once and
                              sold him to one of these fellows; and the next time I seed him, he was
                              carrying the cretur about with him for a show. And he did not remember
                              me; and so I axed him what it was; and be said 'twas an
                              Effrican tiger right from Duck river! Lord! how the folks did laugh;
                              'cause you see, sir, Duck river is just a little way down here in
                              Tennessee, not over five hundred miles off; and Effrica, they tell me, is
                              away t'other side of the herring-pond, where the negurs come from.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1249">By this time the rifle was loaded, and they advanced toward the
                              fallen deer. They were quite near before Arthur discovered him; and,
                              at the moment, the animal (a noble buck of ten branches) recovered
                              himself so far as to regain his feet. He still staggered, but the sudden
                              sight of his enemy seemed, at once, to stiffen his limbs with horror,
                              and give them strength to support him. In an instant his formidable
                              antlers were pointed; and, with eyes glaring and blood-shot, and his
                              hair all turned the wrong way, he was in act to spring forward. At
                              the instant, the report of the rifle was again heard, and, pitching on
                              the points of his horns, he turned fairly heels over head, and lay with
                              his legs in air, and quivering in death. Schwartz now drew his knife
                              across the animal's throat, and proceeded to disembowel him, when
                              Arthur asked what he would do with the carcass.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1252">“I'll just hang him up in a sapling,” said he, “till I meet one of
                              our men. There ought to be one close by, and I can send him for him.
                              Where there's a hundred mouths to feed, such a buck as this is a cash
                              article.”

                           <p id="d2e1257">At this moment the snapping of dry sticks caught his ear; and,
                              looking up, he saw a man approaching.

                           <p id="d2e1260">“I don't know that fellow,” said he, looking hard at him. “But it's
                              all one. I can make him know me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1263">The usual salutation now passed, and the stranger said: “If I may
                              be so bold, stranger, I'd be glad to know what parts you are from?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1267">“From Passamaquoddy,” said Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1270">“Can you tell me the price of skins down there away?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1273">“Twenty-five cents and a quarter a pound,” replied Schwartz.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1276">A few more simple questions and out-of-the-way answers were exchanged,
                              when Schwartz, addressing the other, in an under tone, said:
                              “You are one of the new recruits, I reckon? The other nodded; and
                              Schwartz went on to ask their number. Being told they were fifty, he
                              said, gravely: “Now there you are wrong. You are right enough to
                              pass me, after I gave you the word; but then that's no reason you
                              should tell me any thing. I just asked you, you see, to give you a
                              'caution; cause a fellow might come along here that would give you
                              the word as straight as any body, and be a spy all the time. So the
                              right way would be, just to pass him and keep dark, that's the rule;
                              and, by the time he'd find out how many men we've got, may be he'd
                              find out something else he would not like quite so well. But come, let
                              us take the deer up to the road, and you can walk your post and watch
                              it, till I can send somebody for it from the piquet.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1279">The sturdy mountaineer at once shouldered the animal; and, striding
                              along to the road, threw him down, and quietly betook himself to
                              eating the chestnuts that covered the ground. The traveller moved on,
                              and presently came to the piquet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1282">Here was a small party quartered in a rude and ruinous cabin, near
                              which was an enclosure around a beautiful fountain, that welled up
                              from a natural basin of stone. In this were confined twenty or thirty
                              calves. A few horses were piqueted at hand, and the sides of the adjoining
                              hills were covered with a numerous herd of fat cattle, browsing
                              on the faded, but still succulent vegetation. The time was come when
                              they should have been driven down for the winter, to the farms of their
                              owners below, but they were left here that the men might have the use
                              of the milk. Should their hunting at any time prove unsuccessful,
                              there was always a beef at hand.

                           <p id="d2e1286">Here Schwartz was known, and joyfully welcomed. He stopped
                              only to tell of the deer, and moved on. “You have a curious system
                              here,” said Arthur; “I see the people here know you, but how did
                              you manage with that new recruit. I watched you, and I did not see
                              you give him any sign, and he did not ask for a countersign.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e1291">“That is all because you don't know what foolish answers I gave to
                              his questions. You see we ha'nt got no countersign rightly; 'cause
                              you see, when I stop a man, I want to know who he is, but I don't
                              want to tell him any thing about myself. But if I ax a man for the
                              countersign, just so I might as well tell him I am on guard at once.
                              So we've just got, may be, twenty simple questions; and when we ask
                              them, our own folks know what answer to give, and the answer is sure
                              to be one that nobody would give unless he was in the secret.”

                           <p id="d2e1297">“O! nothing easier, sir. That man, that gave you the map, was
                              not no more lame than you. But I told him to be sure and not to give
                              it to nobody but you, and then to limp so as you'd be sure to notice it.
                              You see, it was I that was to try fall in with you, and pilot you; but,
                              after that, I got upon another scheme. As to the other paper, that
                              was to serve you with our folks, because there was a mark there you
                              did not notice, that any of them would know; and then they would be
                              middling sure you were the man you said you were. They would have
                              been civil to you, and let you pass, but then they would have sent a
                              man or two to the camp with you. And now, Mr. Trevor, 
                              <hi id="d2e1299" style="font-style: italic;">here is</hi> something
                              that I 
                              <hi id="d2e1302" style="font-style: italic;">can</hi> see, and I have a notion it's worth looking at.”

                           <p id="d2e1306">While he was yet speaking, Arthur's ears had been saluted by a
                              brawling sound, which he now recognized as the rush of water. Turning
                              his head toward it, he perceived that it proceeded from a deep and
                              shaggy dell, which the path was now approaching, and along the verge
                              of which it presently wound. Here the plain broke sheer down into
                              a gulph of vast depth, at the bottom of which a considerable stream
                              was seen. It dashed rapidly along, pouring its sparkling waters over
                              successive barriers of yellow rock, that sent up a golden gleam from
                              beneath the crystal sheet that covered them. The mountain-pine, the
                              fir, the kalmia, and numberless other evergreens, which nearly filled
                              the gorge, afforded only occasional glimpses of the water; while they
                              set off the picturesque appearance of so much as they permitted to be
                              seen. As they advanced, they came to a part where the trees had been
                              cut from the brow of the cliff; and, several of those below having been
                              removed, a clearer view was afforded

                           <p id="d2e1313">Here, at the depth of two hundred feet, figures were seen moving to
                              and fro, while, right opposite, under a beetling cliff, that screened them
                              from above, were groups clustered around fires, kindled against the
                              rock, behind a rude breast-work of logs. The whole breadth of the
                              stream was here exposed to view, apparently twenty or thirty yards
                              wide. Though shallow, by reason of its rapidity it seemed to pour a
                              vast volume of water.

                           <p id="d2e1318">Standing on the brow of the cliff, Schwartz now uttered a shout, and
                              immediately half a dozen men, seizing their rifles, moved up the glen,
                              and were soon hidden under the bank on which the travellers stood.
                              They now went on, and presently reached a point at which the path,
                              turning short to the left, dived into the abyss, leading down a rugged
                              ledge that sloped along the face of the cliff, in the direction
                              opposite to that of the approach. It reached the very bottom, nearly
                              under the point from which the shout of Schwartz had given notice
                              of his presence. Here he stopped; and requesting Arthur to wait a
                              moment, he descended. He had not gone far before his name was
                              repeated by a dozen voices, and immediately he was heard to say:
                              “Yes, it is Schwartz, and I have a friend with me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1321">“Bring him down,” was the answer; upon which Schwartz returning,
                              requested Arthur to follow him, and mind his footing. Arthur
                              obeyed, and descended, not without some appearance of danger, sometimes
                              leaping and sometimes crawling, until be reached the group
                              stationed at the foot of this rude stair-way. Here let us leave him for
                              a while, and go back to enquire who and whence he was.

                           <p id="d2e1361">ARTHUR TREVOR was the youngest son of a gentleman who resided
                              in the neighborhood of Richmond. He was a man in affluent circumstances,
                              and had long and honorably filled various important and dignified
                              stations in the service of his native State. Endowed with handsome
                              talents, and amiable disposition, and all the accomplishments that
                              can adorn a gentleman, he added to these the most exemplary virtues.
                              His influence in society had, of course, been great, and though now, at
                              the age of seventy, withdrawn from public life, his opinions were enquired
                              of, and his counsel sought, by all who had access to him.
                              Through life be had been remarkable for firmness, and yet more for
                              prudence. The steadiness of his principles could never be questioned,
                              but, it was thought, he had sometimes deemed it wise to compromise,
                              when men of less cautious temper would have found safety in prudent
                              boldness.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1364">To this temperament had been attributed his conduct in regard to
                              the politics of the last twenty years. Bred up in the school of State
                              rights, and thoroughly imbued with its doctrines, he had, even before
                              that time, been accustomed to look, with a jealous eye, on the progressive
                              usurpations of the Federal Government. In the hope of arresting
                              these, he had exerted more than his usual activity in aiding to put
                              down the younger Adams, and to elevate his successor. Though no
                              candidate for the spoils of victory, no man rejoiced more sincerely in
                              the result of that contest; and, until the emanation of the proclamation
                              of December, 1832, he had given his hearty approbation, and steady,
                              though quiet support, to the administration of Andrew Jackson.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1368">From that moment he seemed to look with fearful bodings on the
                              affairs of his country. His disapprobation of that instrument was
                              expressed with as much freedom and force as was consistent with his
                              habitual reserve and moderation. He was, indeed, alarmed into a degree
                              of excitement unusual with him, and might have gone farther
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1370"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span>
                              than he did, had he not found that others were disposed to go, as he
                              thought, too far. He had entirely disapproved the nullifying ordinance
                              of South Carolina; and, though he recognized the right of secession,
                              he deprecated all thought of resorting to that remedy. He was aware
                              that many of his best friends, thinking that its necessity would be
                              eventually felt by all, feared that that conviction might come too late.
                              They remarked the steady tendency of Federal measures to weaken the
                              mal-content States in the South, and to increase the resources of their
                              northern oppressors and those of the General Government. Hence
                              they feared, that whenever Virginia, or any other of the slave-holding
                              States, should find itself driven to secession, the other party, in the
                              confidence of superior strength, might be tempted forcibly to resist the
                              exercise of the right. They thus arrived at the conclusion that separation
                              (which they deemed inevitable) to be peaceable, must be
                              prompt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1373">These ideas had been laid before Mr. Trevor, and, in proportion to
                              the urgency with which they were pressed, was his alarm and his disposition
                              to adhere to the Union. He, at last, had brought himself to
                              believe union, on any terms, better than disunion, under any 
                              circumstances. As the lesser evil, therefore, he determined to forget the
                              proclamation, and, striving to reconcile himself to all the acts of the
                              administration, he regarded every attempt to unite the South, in support
                              of a southern president, as a prelude to the formation of a southern
                              confederacy. By consequence, he became a partisan of Martin Van
                              Buren; and united with Ritchie, and others of the same kidney, in
                              endeavoring to subdue the spirit, and tame down the State pride of
                              Virginia. These endeavors, aided by the lavish use of federal patronage
                              in the State, were so far successful, that when, at the end of Van
                              Buren's second term, he demanded a third election, she alone, in the
                              South, supported his pretensions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1376">By the steady employment of the same pernicious influences, the
                              elections throughout the State had been so regulated, as to produce
                              returns of a majority of members devoted to the views of the usurper.
                              This had continued until the spring of 1848, at which time the results
                              of the elections were essentially the same which had taken place since
                              the memorable 1836: when Virginia, at one stroke of the pen 
                              <hi id="d2e1378" style="font-style: italic;">expunged</hi>
                              her name from the chronicles of honor, 
                              <hi id="d2e1381" style="font-style: italic;">expunged</hi> the history of all her
                              glories, 
                              <hi id="d2e1384" style="font-style: italic;">expunged herself.</hi> From that time the land of Washington,
                              and Henry, and Mason, of Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, sunk to
                              the rank of a province, administered and managed by the Riveses and
                              Ritchies, the Barbours and Stevensons, the Watkinses and Wilsons,
                              whose chance to be remembered in history depends, like that of

                              had taken place between the spring elections and the recurrence of that
                              
                              <hi id="d2e1404" style="font-style: italic;">form</hi> of presidential election in the fall, the observance of which was
                              still deemed necessary to display, and, by displaying, to perpetuate the
                              usurper's power. This reaction appeared to show itself chiefly in those
                              counties heretofore most distinguished for their loyalty. It would have
                              seemed as if the spirit of John Randolph had risen from the sleep of
                              death, and walked abroad through the scenes where his youthful shoulders
                              had received the mantle of 
                              <hi id="d2e1407" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> eloquence from the land of Henry.
                              For the first time, in twelve years, the vote of Virginia was recorded
                              against the re-election of Martin Van Buren to the presidential throne.

                           <p id="d2e1411">But not the less subservient were the proceedings of the Legislature
                              elected for his use, the spring before. Yet enough had been done to
                              justify the hope that the ancient spirit of old Virginia would yet show
                              itself in the descendants of the men who had defied Cromwell, in the
                              plenitude of his power, and had cast off the yoke of George the Third,
                              without waiting for the co-operation of the other colonies. At the
                              same time, the power and the will of a fixed majority in the North, to
                              give a master to the South, had been made manifest. It was clearly
                              seen, too, that he had determined to use the power thus obtained, and
                              to administer the government solely with a view to the interest of that
                              sectional faction, by which he had been supported. “

                              “Woe to the vanquished!” was the word. It had gone forth; and
                              northern cupidity and northern fanaticism were seen to march, hand in
                              hand, to the plunder and desolation of the South.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1421">Under these circumstances, the southern States had been, at length,
                              forced to see that the day for decisive action had arrived. They therefore
                              determined no longer to abide the obligations of a constitution, the
                              forms of which alone remained, and having, by a movement nearly
                              simultaneous, seceded from the Union, they had immediately formed a
                              southern confederacy. The suddenness of these measures was less
                              remarkable than the prudence with which they had been conducted.
                              The two together left little doubt that there had been a preconcert
                              among the leading men of the several States, arranging provisionally
                              what should be done, whenever circumstances should throw power into
                              hands of those whom, at the bidding of the usurper, the people had
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1423"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span>
                              once driven from their councils. It is now known that there was such
                              concert. Nor was it confined to the seceding States alone. In Virginia,
                              also, there were men who entered into the same views. But while the
                              President believed that no decisive step would be taken by the more
                              southern States without her co-operation, he had devoted all his power,
                              direct and indirect, to control and influence her election. Of tumultuary
                              insurrection he had no fear. The organized operation of the
                              State Government was what he dreaded. By this alone could the
                              measure of secession be effected; and this was effectually prevented by
                              operating on the elections of members of the Legislature. From the
                              November vote on the presidential election, less evil had been apprehended,
                              and less pains had been taken to control it. In consequence of
                              this, something more of the real sentiments of the people had been
                              allowed to appear on that occasion; and, from this manifestation, the
                              more southern States were encouraged to hope for the ultimate accession
                              of Virginia to their confederacy. They had therefore determined to
                              wait for her no longer, but to proceed to the execution of their plan,
                              leaving her to follow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1426">The disposition of the usurper, at first, was to treat them as revolted
                              provinces; and to take measures for putting down, by force, their
                              resistance to his authority. But circumstances, to be mentioned hereafter,
                              made it impolitic to resort to this measure. But these did not operate
                              to prevent him from using the most efficacious means to prevent Virginia
                              from following their example. Though restrained from attacking
                              them, nothing prevented him from affecting to fear an attack 
                              <hi id="d2e1428" style="font-style: italic;">from</hi> them.
                              This gave a pretext for raising troops; and the position of Virginia,
                              as the frontier State, afforded an excuse for stationing them
                              within her borders. Under these pretences, small corps were established
                              in many of the disaffected counties. Should the presence of these
                              be ineffectual to secure the return of delegates devoted to the crown,
                              an ultimate security was taken against the action of the Legislature.
                              Richmond, the seat of government, became the head-quarters of the
                              army of observation, as it was called, and, surrounded by this, the mock
                              deliberations of the General Assembly were to be held.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1432">The money thus thrown into the country seduced the corrupt, while
                              terror subdued the timid. On Mr. Trevor, who was neither, these
                              things had a contrary effect. He now, when it was too late, saw and
                              lamented the error of his former overcaution. He now began to suspect
                              that they had been right who had urged him, eighteen years before,
                              to lend his aid in the work of arousing the people to a sense of
                              their danger, and preparing them to meet it as one man.

                           <p id="d2e1458">AMONG those who had been most prompt to take this view of the
                              subject, and most vehement in recommending it, was a younger brother
                              of Mr. Trevor. In all, but, the great essentials of moral worth, this
                              gentleman was the very reverse of his brother. The difference was,
                              perhaps, mainly attributable to the character of his intellect. Quick
                              in conception, and clear in his views, he was strong in his convictions,
                              and habitually satisfied with his conclusions. This, added to a hasty
                              temper, gave him the appearance and character of a man rash, inconsiderate,
                              and precipitate, always in advance of the progress of public
                              opinion, and too impatient to wait for it. His ill success in life seemed
                              to justify this construction. Though eminently gifted by nature, and
                              possessing all the advantages of education he had never occupied any
                              of those stations in which distinction is to be gained. In his private
                              affairs, he had been alike unprosperous. Though his habits were not
                              expensive, his patrimony had been but little increased by his own exertions.
                              He had married a lady of handsome property, but had added
                              little to it. With only two daughters, he had not the means of endowing
                              them with more than a decent competency; while his elder brother,
                              with a family of a dozen children, had educated the whole, had provided
                              handsomely for such as had set out in life, and retained the wherewithal
                              to give the rest nearly as much as the children of the younger
                              could expect. In short, the career of Mr. Hugh Trevor had been one
                              of uninterrupted prosperity. In all his undertakings he had been
                              successful. Wealth had flowed into his coffers, and honors had been
                              showered on his head. “When the eye saw him, then it blessed him.”
                              Men pointed him out to their children, and said to them: “Copy his
                              example, and follow in his steps.”

                           <p id="d2e1461">The life of Bernard, the younger brother, had been passed in comparative 
                              obscurity. Beloved by a few, but misunderstood by many, his
                              existence was unknown to the multitude, and unheeded by most who
                              were aware of it. They, indeed, who knew him well, saw in him qualities
                              which, under discreet regulation, might have won for him distinction
                              and affluence. None knew him better, and none saw this more
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1463"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span>
                              clearly, than his elder brother. No man gave him more credit for
                              talent and honor, or less for prudence and common sense. A habit of
                              doubting the correctness of his opinions, and condemning his measures,
                              had thus taken possession of the mind of Mr. Hugh Trevor: and, as
                              the quick and intuitive Bernard was commonly the first to come to a
                              conclusion, the knowledge of that created, in the other, a predisposition
                              to arrive at a different result. In proportion as the one was clear, so
                              did the other doubt. When the former was ardent, the latter was
                              always cold; and in all matters in which they had a common interest,
                              the cautious foresight of Hugh never failed to see a lion in the path
                              which Bernard wished to pursue. They were the opposite poles of the
                              same needle. The clear convictions of the latter on the subject of
                              secession, had shaken the faith of the former in his own, and had finally
                              driven him to the conclusion already intimated, “that 
                              <hi id="d2e1465" style="font-style: italic;">union, on any
                                 terms
                              </hi>, was better than disunion, 
                              <hi id="d2e1468" style="font-style: italic;">under any circumstances.</hi>”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1473">The same habit of thinking had retarded the change, which the
                              events of the last three years had been working in the mind of Mr.
                              Hugh Trevor. His native candor and modesty made it easy for him to
                              believe that he had been wrong, and, being convinced of error, to admit
                              it. But a corollary from this admission would be, that the inconsiderate
                              and imprudent Bernard had, all the time, been right. Of the
                              correctness of such an admission Mr. Trevor felt an habitual diffidence,
                              that made him among the last to avow a change of opinion which,
                              perhaps, commenced in no mind sooner than in his. But the change
                              was now complete, and it brought to the conscientious old gentleman a
                              conviction that on him, above all men, it was incumbent to spare no
                              means in his power to remove the mischiefs of which he felt his own
                              supineness to have been in part the cause.

                           <p id="d2e1476">He was now a private man; but he had sons. To have given a
                              direction to their political course, might not have been difficult. But,
                              in the act of repenting an acknowledged error, how could he presume
                              so far on his new convictions, as to endeavor to bind them on the minds
                              of others? Was it even right to use any portion of his paternal influence
                              for the purpose of giving to the future course of his children's
                              lives such a tendency as might lead them into error, to the disappointment
                              of their hopes, and perhaps to crime? The answer to these
                              questions led to a determination to leave them to their own thoughts,
                              guided by such lights as circumstances might throw upon these important
                              objects.

                           <p id="d2e1479">It happened unfortunately, that, about the time of Mr. Van Buren's
                              accession to the presidency, his eldest son had just reached that time
                              of life when it is necessary to choose a profession. Without any particular
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1481"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span>
                              purpose of devoting him to the army, he had been educated at
                              West Point. The favor of President Jackson had offered this advantage,
                              which, by the father of so large a family, was not to be declined. But
                              the young man acquired a taste for military life, and, as there was no
                              man in Virginia whom the new President was more desirous to bind to
                              his service than Mr. Hugh Trevor, his wishes had been ascertained,
                              and the ready advancement of his son was the consequence. The promotion
                              of Owen Trevor had accordingly been hastened by all means
                              consistent with the rules of the service. Even these were sometimes
                              violated in his favor. In one instance, he had been elevated over the
                              head of a senior officer of acknowledged merit. The impatience of this
                              gentleman, which tempted him to offer his resignation, had been soothed
                              by a staff appointment, accompanied by an understanding that he
                              should not, unnecessarily, be placed under the immediate command of
                              young Trevor. The latter, at the date of which we speak, had risen to
                              the command of a regiment, which was now encamped in the neighborhood
                              of Washington, in daily expectation of being ordered on
                              active duty.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1484">Colonel Owen Trevor had received his first impressions on political
                              subjects at a time when circumstances made his father anxious to
                              establish in his mind a conviction that union was the one thing needful.
                              To the maintenance of this he had taught him to devote himself, and,
                              overlooking his allegiance to his native State, to consider himself as the
                              sworn soldier of the Federal Government. It was certainly not the
                              wish of Mr. Trevor to teach his son to regard Virginia merely as a
                              municipal division of a great consolidated empire. But while he taught
                              him to act on precepts which seemed drawn from such premises, it was
                              natural that the young man should adopt them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1487">He did adopt them. He had learned to deride the idea of State
                              sovereignty, and his long residence in the North had given him a
                              disgust at all that is peculiar in the manners, habits, institutions, and
                              character of Virginia. Among his boon companions he had been
                              accustomed to express these sentiments, and, being repeated at court,
                              they had made him a favorite there. He had been treated by the President
                              with distinguished attention. He seemed honored, too, with the
                              personal friendship of that favorite son whom he had elevated to the chief
                              command of the army. Him he had consecrated to the purple; proposing
                              to cast on him the mantle of his authority, so as to unite, in the person
                              of his chosen successor, the whole military and civil power of the
                              empire.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1490">It was impossible that a young man like Col. Trevor should fail to
                              feel himself flattered by such notice. He had been thought, when a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1492"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="28"> </a></span>
                              boy, to be warm-hearted and generous, and his devotion to his patrons,
                              which was unbounded, was placed to the account of gratitude by his
                              friends. The President, on his part, was anxiously watching for an
                              opportunity to reward this personal zeal, which is so strong a recommendation
                              to the favor of the great. It was intimated to Col. Trevor
                              that nothing was wanting to ensure him speedy promotion to the rank
                              of Brigadier but some act of service which might be magnified, by a
                              pensioned press, into a pretext for advancing him beyond his equals in
                              rank. Apprised of this, he burned for active employment, and earnestly
                              begged to be marched to the theatre of war.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1496">This theatre was in Virginia. But he had long since ceased to attribute
                              any political personality to the State, and it was a matter of no
                              consequence to him that the enemies, against whom he was to act, had
                              been born or resided there. Personally, they were strangers to him;
                              and he only know them as men denying the supremacy of the Federal
                              Government and hostile to the President and his intended successor.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1499">One person, indeed, he might possibly meet in arms whom he would
                              gladly avoid. His younger brother, Douglas Trevor, had been, like
                              himself, educated at West Point, had entered the army, and served
                              some years. Having spent a winter at home, it was suspected that he
                              had become infected with the treasonable heresies of Southern politicians.
                              He had resigned his commission and travelled into South Carolina.
                              The effect of this journey on his mind was not a matter of
                              doubt. Letters had been received from him by his brother and several
                              young officers of his own regiment, avowing a total change of sentiment.
                              These letters left no doubt that should Virginia declare for secession,
                              or even in case of collision between the Southern League and
                              the old United States, he would be found fighting against the latter.
                              The avowal of such sentiments and purposes had so excited the displeasure
                              of the Colonel, that he had cut short the correspondence by
                              begging that he might never again be reminded that he was the brother
                              of a traitor. His letter, to this effect, being laid before the
                              commander-in-chief, had given the most decisive proof of the zeal of one
                              brother and the defection of the other.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1502">How this had been brought about, Col. Trevor knew not. He was
                              not aware of any alteration in his father's sentiments; and, indeed,
                              Douglas himself had not been so, at the time when he was awakened to
                              a sense of his country's wrongs and his own duty. The change in his
                              mind had been wrought by other means; for his father was, at that
                              time, doubting, and, with him, to doubt was to be profoundly silent.

                              Mr. Hugh Trevor and his brother, though it had interrupted
                              their intercourse by rendering it less agreeable. Men cannot take
                              much pleasure in each other's society when the subject on which both
                              think and feel most deeply is one on which they widely differ. They
                              accordingly saw little of each other, though an occasional letter passed
                              between them in token of unabated affection.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1534">I believe I have mentioned that the children of Mr. Bernard Trevor
                              were both daughters. The eldest, then seventeen years of age, had
                              been invited to spend with her uncle, in the vicinity of Richmond, the
                              winter of Douglas's furlough. He was at that time about five-and-twenty.
                              His long residence in the North had not weaned him from
                              his native State. He had not been flattered into a contempt of everything
                              Virginian. Neither his age nor rank gave him consequence
                              enough to be the object of that sort of attention. Perhaps, too, it, had
                              been seen that he was a less fit subject for it than his elder brother.
                              Though much the younger, he had a range, originality, and independence
                              of thought, of which the other was incapable. Resting in the
                              esteem of his friends and the approbation of his own conscience, the
                              applause of the multitude, the flattery of sycophants, and the seducing
                              attentions of superiors, had small charms for him. His heart had never
                              ceased to glow at the name of Virginia, and he returned to her as the
                              wanderer should return to the bosom of his home—to his friends—to
                              his native land. In appearance, manners, and intelligence, he was
                              much improved; in feeling, the same warm-hearted, generous,
                              unsophisticated youth, as formerly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1538">In the meantime, his cousin Delia had already reached his father's
                              house, and was domesticated in the family. There she found the
                              younger brothers and sisters of Douglas impatiently expecting his arrival,
                              and so much occupied with the thought of him, that, had she
                              been of a jealous disposition, she might have deemed her welcome
                              somewhat careless. But she already knew her cousins, her uncle, and
                              her aunt. This was not the first time that their house was her temporary
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1540"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="37" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span>
                              home, and she had learned to consider herself as one of the family.
                              As such she was expected to enter into all their feelings. Douglas
                              was their common favorite. During his long absence, his heart had
                              never cooled toward them. In this he differed widely from Owen, in
                              whom the pleasures of an idle life and the schemes of ambition had
                              left little thought of the simple joys of his childhood's home. The
                              contrast between him and Douglas, in this respect, rendered the latter
                              yet more popular with the single-hearted beings who were impatiently
                              waiting his return.

                              one year younger than Delia. “Mamma says you were a great pet
                              with him when a child, and used to call him your Douglas.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1546">“I could not have been more than three years old at the time you
                              speak of,” said Delia; “but I have heard of it so often, that I seem to
                              myself to remember it. But, of course, I do not remember him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1549">“And, of course, he does not remember you,” said Mrs. Trevor.
                              “At least, he would not know you. But I doubt if he ever has forgotten
                              you, as you were then. He was to be your husband, you know;
                              and your father gave him a set of rules to walk by. He was to do so
                              and so, and to be so and so; and Harry Sanford was to be his model.
                              He said nothing about it; but “Sanford and Merton” was hardly ever
                              out of his hands and we could see that he was always trying to square
                              his conduct by your father's maxims. I believe in my heart it made a
                              difference in the boy; and that is the reason why he is less like his own
                              father, and more like yours, than any of the rest of my boys.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1552">“I shall certainly love him, then,” said Delia, her eyes filling as she
                              spoke, “if he is like my dear old father.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1555">“Indeed, and you may,” said Mrs. Trevor; “but for all that, I
                              would rather have him like his own father. But you must not be
                              affronted, Delia; you know I claim the right to brag about my old man,
                              and to set him up over everybody—even the President himself.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1559">“I never saw the President,” said Delia, “but I should be sorry to
                              compare my father with him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1562">“I can assure you,” replied the aunt, “there are very few men that
                              would 
                              <hi id="d2e1564">bear</hi> the comparison. O! he is the most elegant, agreeable old
                              gentleman, that ever I saw.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1568">“Except my uncle,” said Delia, smiling.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1571">“Pshaw! Yes, to be sure. I always except him.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1574">“
                              <hi id="d2e1576" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> will not except 
                              <hi id="d2e1579" style="font-style: italic;">my father</hi>,” said Delia, gravely. “I should not
                              like to hear him and Martin Van Buren praised in the same breath.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1583">“Well, my dear,” said the good-humored old lady, “we must not

                              quarrel about it; but you must take care not to talk so before Douglas,
                              because he is the President's soldier.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1589">“I thought,” said Delia, “he was in the service of the United States.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1592">“Well! and is not that all the same thing? 
                              <hi id="d2e1594" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> do not pretend to
                              know anything about it; but my husband says so, and that is enough
                              for me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1598">Mr. Trevor, who had sat by the while, listening, with grave complacency,
                              now said: “I am afraid you don't report me truly, my dear.”
                              Then, extending his hand to Delia, he drew her gently to him, and
                              placing her on his knee, kissed her. “You are a good girl,” said he,
                              “and shall love and honor your father as much as you please. He is a
                              noble, generous man, and a wise man, too. I would to God,” added
                              he, sighing heavily, “that I had had half his wisdom.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1601">“Why, bless my soul, Mr. Trevor!” exclaimed his wife, “what does
                              this mean?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1604">“Nothing,” replied he, “but a just compliment to the self-renouncing
                              generosity and far-sighted sagacity of my brother.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1607">Saying this, he rose and left the room, while his wife gazed after him
                              in amazement. She had never heard him say so much before, and now
                              perceived that he had thoughts that she was not apprised of. Believing
                              him faultless and incapable of error, even when he differed from
                              himself, she at once concluded that she had lost her cue, and determined
                              to say no more about politics until she recovered it; but he
                              never adverted to the subject again, in her presence, during the whole
                              winter, and her niece, consequently, heard no farther allusion to it from
                              her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1611">This was no unwelcome relief to Delia. She was no politician, but
                              she was not incapable of understanding what passed in her presence
                              on the subject, except when the interlocutors chose to mystify their
                              meaning. Her father, a man of no reserves, never spoke but with a
                              purpose of expressing his thoughts clearly and fully; and no man
                              better knew how to express them than he. Though deficient, as I have
                              said, in that cold prudence which takes advantage of circumstances, he
                              was eminently gifted with that more vigorous faculty 
                              <hi id="d2e1613" style="font-style: italic;">which makes them</hi>.
                              In the piping times of peace, he was a man of no mark; but when society
                              was breaking up from its foundations, he was the man with whom
                              the timid and doubting would seek safety and counsel. Infirmity had
                              now overtaken him and he could do little more than think and speak.
                              Consulted by all the bold spirits who sought to lift up, from the dust,
                              the soiled and tattered banner of his native State, and spread it to the
                              wind, he never failed to converse freely with such, and often in the
                              presence of his daughters.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1617"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="32"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1619">By this means, if he had not imbued them with his opinions, or
                              charged their minds with the arguments by which he was accustomed
                              to support them, he had made them full partakers of his feelings. It
                              seemed, indeed, as if he had a purpose in this. What that purpose
                              was, time would show. One end, at least, it answered. It increased
                              their opinion of his powers, their confidence in his wisdom, and their
                              love for his person. Mrs. Hugh Trevor herself did not hold her
                              husband's wisdom in more reverence than was cherished by Delia for that
                              of her father.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1622">And never did man better deserve the confiding affection of a daughter.
                              He had been her principal instructor from infancy. He had
                              formed her mind; he had trained her to self-command, and taught her
                              to find her happiness in virtue. Educated at home, her manners were
                              formed in a domestic circle—characterized by refinement, and
                              delicate, but frank propriety. Her love of reading had been cultivated by
                              throwing books in her way; and, the taste once formed, her attention
                              had been directed to such as might best qualify her for the duties of
                              woman's only appropriate station. Herein she had an example in her
                              mother, a lady of the old school, courteous and gentle, but high-spirited,
                              generous, and full of her husband's enthusiasm in the cause of his
                              country. Mr. Bernard Trevor was, indeed, a man to be loved passionately,
                              if loved at all; and to shed the vivid hue of his mind on those of
                              his associates. It was the delight of his wife to witness and to cherish
                              the dutiful affection and ardent admiration of her daughters for their
                              father. The consequence was, that his power over their thoughts, feelings,
                              and inclinations was unbounded.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1625">It will be readily believed that, in the mind of Delia Trevor, thus
                              pre-occupied, there was no room for any very favorable predispositions
                              toward a young man trained from his boyhood in the service of her
                              country's oppressors. She had heard his mother speak of him as the
                              sworn soldier of the arch-enemy of her beloved Virginia, and a sentiment
                              of abhorrence arose in her mind at the words; but she reflected
                              that he was her cousin; the son of her good uncle; the brother of her
                              dearest friend; and, trying to remember his fondness for her when a
                              child, she chided down the feeling of disgust as unnatural and wicked.
                              But, after all this discipline of her own mind, she found it impossible
                              to think of him with complacency, or to anticipate his arrival with
                              pleasure. Her imagination always painted him in the hateful dress
                              which she had been taught to regard as the badge of slavery—the livery
                              of a tyrant. She would try to love him, as a kinsman, but she
                              never could like him or respect him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1628">At length he made his appearance, and, to her great relief, in the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1630"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="33"> </a></span>
                              plain attire of a citizen. He was a handsome youth, whose native
                              grace had been improved by his military education, and in his manners
                              uniting the frankness of a boy with the polish and elegance of an
                              accomplished gentleman. Whether he had been admonished by his
                              father to respect the feelings of his fair cousin, or had caught his
                              reserve, on the subject of politics, by contagion, she had no means of
                              knowing. Certain it is, that on that subject he was uniformly silent,
                              and Delia soon learned to converse with him on other topics without
                              dreading an allusion to that. She thus saw him as he was, and, by
                              degrees, lost the prejudice which, for a time, blinded her to any merit he
                              might possess.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1634">And he did possess great merit. A high sense of honor, strict
                              principles, great openness and generosity, were united in him with
                              talents of no common order. Quick, apprehensive, and clear in his
                              perceptions, there was a boldness, vividness, and distinctness in his
                              thoughts and language that continually reminded her of him she most
                              loved and honored. Of her father he frequently spoke with great veneration
                              and affection. He remembered, as his mother had conjectured,
                              many of his uncle's precepts. He frequently quoted them as of high
                              authority with him; and it was plain to see that, cherished during
                              fourteen years, they had exercised a decided influence in the formation of
                              his character. Indeed, it might be doubted whether his imagination
                              had ever dismissed the idea which had first disposed him to lend a
                              willing ear to the suggestions of his uncle. That which was sport to
                              the elder members of the family, had seemed to him, at the time, a serious
                              business. The thought that the little girl who loved to hang on
                              his neck and kiss him might one day be his wife, had certainly taken
                              possession of his boyish mind. How long he had consciously retained
                              it could not be known; but the traces of it were still there, and were
                              certainly not obliterated by the change which time had wrought in his
                              cousin.

                           <p id="d2e1637">Of her personal appearance I have said nothing. Were I writing a
                              novel, I should be bound, by all precedent, to give an exact account of
                              Delia's whole exterior. Her person, her countenance, her hair, her eyes,
                              her complexion, should all be described, and the whole summed up in
                              a 
                              <hi id="d2e1639" style="font-style: italic;">tout ensemble</hi> of surpassing beauty. But, in this true history, I am
                              unfortunately bound down by facts, and I lament, that to the best of
                              my recollection, I shall not have occasion to speak of a single female,
                              in the progress of my narrative, whose beauty can be made a theme of
                              just praise. I do sincerely lament this; for such is the constitution of
                              human nature, that female beauty influences the heart and mind of
                              man, even by report. We read, in Oriental tales, of great princes
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1642"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="34"> </a></span>
                              deeply enamored of descriptions. The grey eyes of Queen Elizabeth
                              have always made her unpopular with the youthful reader; and the
                              beauty of Mary of Scotland, three hundred years after the worms had
                              eaten her, still continues to gild her history and gloss over her crimes.
                              I can say nothing so much in favour of the beauty of Delia Trevor, as
                              that she was good and intelligent, reminding the reader of the sage
                              adage of Mrs. Dorothy Primrose, to wit: “Handsome is, that handsome
                              does.” I can only add, that, when I saw her afterwards hanging on
                              the arm of Douglas, and looking up in his face with all the deep and
                              heartfelt devotion of a woman's love, I saw enough of the constituents
                              of beauty to make her an object of love, and enough of the soul of
                              truth and tenderness to make her seem transcendently beautiful in the
                              eyes of a lover.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1645">I say this, to account for the fact that her cousin Douglas soon found
                              himself taking great pleasure in her society, and anxious to please her,
                              not more from duty than inclination. He was, perhaps, chiefly attracted
                              by her conversation, which was always cheerful, sprightly, and intelligent.
                              He may have yielded to a spell of hardly less magic than that
                              of beauty; the spell of a voice melodious, distinct, articulate, and
                              richly flexible, varying its tones unconsciously with every change and
                              grade of thought or feeling. It may have been the effect of what Byron
                              would call “blind contact,” and the sage Mrs. Broadhurst “propinquity;”
                              or it may have been that his hour was come. If one in ten of
                              my married friends can tell exactly how 
                              <hi id="d2e1647" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> came to fall in love with
                              his wife, I shall hold myself bound to inquire farther into this matter.

                           <p id="d2e1651">But I do not mean to intimate that Lieutenant Trevor, turning his
                              back on the belles of Boston and New York, and Philadelphia, and
                              Baltimore, and Washington, came home, and tumbled forthwith into love
                              with a plain country girl, just because she was his cousin, and he had
                              loved her when a child. I do not mean to say he was in love with her
                              at all. He had a sincere affection for her; he liked her conversation;
                              he admired her talents much, and her virtues more. He liked very
                              much to be with her, and was very much with her.

                           <p id="d2e1674">DOUGLAS TREVOR reached his father's house just after the Virginia
                              Legislature had assembled. The presidential election was just over,
                              and the partisans of Van Buren, exulting in their success, made their
                              leader the more hateful to his opponents by the insolence of their
                              triumph. Though he had lost the vote of Virginia, it will be remembered
                              that he still commanded a majority in the Legislature, elected before
                              the revolution in public sentiment was complete. The more recent
                              expression of public sentiment showed that the time was come when
                              power must be held by means far different from those by which it had
                              been acquired. Opinion, which at first had been in their favor, was
                              now against them. Corruption had for a time supplied the place; but
                              the fund of corruption was all insufficient to buy off the important
                              interests which were now roused to defend themselves. To add to its
                              efficiency by all practicable means, and to bring to its aid the arm of
                              force, was all that remained.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1677">To organize measures for this purpose, and to enrich themselves from
                              the profuse disbursement of public money, which formed a part of the
                              plan of operations, were the great objects which engaged the minds of
                              the majority in the Virginia Legislature. But these, important as they
                              were, could not entirely wean them from those indulgences which, for
                              many years, had made Richmond, during the winter season, the scene
                              of so much revel and debauchery. To these, as well as to personal
                              intrigues and the great interests of the faction, much time was given.
                              But the necessity of attending especially to the latter was made daily
                              more apparent by the startling intelligence which every mail brought
                              from the South and Southwest. The nearly simultaneous secession of
                              the States in that quarter, and the measures to be taken for the formation
                              of a southern confederacy, were things which had been talked of
                              until they were no longer dreaded. But causes had gradually wrought
                              their necessary effects, and the ultimate cooperation of Virginia, if left
                              to act freely, was now sure.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1681">I have already spoken of those men, in each of the southern States,
                              of cool heads, long views, and stout hearts, who, watching the progress
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1683"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="36"> </a></span>
                              of events, had clearly seen the point to which they tended. It is not
                              here that their names and deeds are to be registered. They are already
                              recorded in history, and blazoned on the tomb of that hateful tyranny
                              which they overthrew. They had been discarded from the service of
                              the people, so long as the popularity of the President had blinded the
                              multitude to his usurpations. The oppressions of the northern faction,
                              and the fierce assaults of rapacity and fanaticism, hounded on by
                              ambition to the destruction of the South, had restored them to public favor.
                              They had seen that secession must come, and that, come when it might,
                              their influence would be proportioned to their past disgraces. Presuming
                              on this, they had consulted much together. Not only had they
                              sketched provisionally the plan of a southern confederacy, but they had
                              taken measures to regulate their relations with foreign powers. One of
                              their number, travelling abroad, had been instructed to prepare the way
                              for the negotiation of a commercial treaty with great Britain. One of
                              the first acts of the new confederacy was to invest him publicly with
                              the diplomatic character, and it was at once understood that commercial
                              arrangements would be made, the value of which would secure to the
                              infant League all the advantages of an alliance with that powerful nation.
                              The designation of a gentleman, as minister, who had so long,
                              without any ostensible motive, resided near the Court of St. James, left
                              no doubt that all things had been already arranged. The treaty soon
                              after promulgated, therefore, surprised nobody, except indeed that some
                              of its details were too obviously beneficial to both parties to have been
                              expected. Not only in war, but in peace, do nations seem to think it
                              less important to do good to themselves than to do harm to each other.
                              The system of free trade now established, which has restored to the
                              South the full benefit of its natural advantages, and made it once more
                              the most flourishing and prosperous country on earth; which has multiplied
                              the manufactories of Great Britain, and increased her revenue
                              by an increase of consumption and resources, even while some branches
                              of revenue were cut off; and which, at the same time, has broken the
                              power of her envious rival in the North, and put an end for ever to
                              that artificial prosperity engendered by the oppression and plunder of
                              the southern States; is such an anomaly in modern diplomacy, that the
                              rulers at Richmond, or even at Washington, might well have been surprised
                              at it. But the bare nomination of the plenipotentiary was
                              enough to leave no doubt that a treaty was ready for promulgation, and
                              that its terms must be such as to secure the cooperation of Great
                              Britain.

                           <p id="d2e1686">But, while the leaders of the ruling faction thought of these things,
                              and anxiously consulted for the preservation of their power, there was
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1688"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="44" data-tei-n="37"> </a></span>
                              still found among the members of the Legislature the ordinary proportion
                              of men who think of nothing but the enjoyment of the present
                              moment. Such men are often like sailors in a storm, who, becoming
                              desperate, break into the spirit room, and drink the more eagerly
                              because they drink for the last time. When the devil's “time is short,
                              he has great wrath;” and this point in his character he always displays,
                              whether he exhibits himself in the form of cruelty, rapacity, or
                              debauchery.

                              suffered little interruption, and the dinner and the galas, the ball
                              and the theatre, and the gaming-table, with revel, dissipation, and
                              extravagance, consumed the time of the servants of the country, and
                              swallowed up the wasted plunder of the treasury.

                              by that to which he was supposed to belong, Mr. Hugh Trevor was an
                              object of the most flattering attention. His house was the favorite
                              resort of such as enjoyed the envied privilege of the 
                              <hi id="d2e1696">entrée</hi>. His gallant
                              and accomplished son was the glass before which aspirant for court
                              favor dressed themselves. The budding youth of his daughter had,
                              for years, been watched with impatient anticipation of the time when
                              her hand might be seized as the passport to present wealth and future
                              honor.

                           <p id="d2e1700">Her cousin Delia was not recommended to notice by 
                              <hi id="d2e1702" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> these
                              considerations; but the most prevailing of the whole was one that made
                              her claims to attention fully equal to those of Virginia. Her father,
                              though in comparatively humble circumstances, could give with his
                              daughter a handsomer dowry than the elder and wealthier brother
                              could afford with his. He was notorious for generosity, and his
                              infirmities made it probable that be was not long for this world. Delia
                              was therefore universally regarded as an heiress. Add to this, that in
                              the affection of her uncle she seemed hardly to be postponed to his
                              own daughter, and it was obvious to anticipate that the same influence
                              which had procured office and emolument for himself and his sons,
                              would be readily exerted in favor of her future husband.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1706">It followed, that, whatever were the amusements of the day, whether
                              ball or theatre, or party of pleasure by land or by water, the presence
                              of Delia and Virginia was eagerly sought. The latter, simple and artless,
                              saw in all who approached her the friends of her father. If she
                              thought at all of political differences, it was only to recognize in most
                              of them the adherents of the man to whose fortunes be had so long
                              attached himself, and 
                              <hi id="d2e1708" style="font-style: italic;">in</hi> whose fortunes he had flourished. To all, her
                              welcome was alike cordial and her smile always bright.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1713"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="45" data-tei-n="38"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1715">With Delia, the case was far different. Much more conversant than
                              her cousin with the politics of the day, she was aware that her father
                              was obnoxious to many that she met. On some of those who sought
                              her favor, she knew that he looked with detestation and scorn. To
                              such she was as cold and repulsive as a real lady can ever permit
                              herself to be to one who approaches her as a gentleman in genteel society.
                              The height of the modern mode would, indeed, have countenanced in
                              such cases that sort of negative insolence, the practice of which is
                              regarded as the most decisive indication of high breeding. But she had
                              been trained in a different school. She had beet taught that, 
                              <hi id="d2e1717" style="font-style: italic;">in society</hi>,
                              self-respect is the first duty of woman; and that the only inviolable
                              safeguard for that, is a care never to offend the self-respect of others.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1721">Thus, while a part of those who approached her, were made to feel
                              that their attentions were not acceptable, she never afforded them
                              occasion to complain of any want of courtesy on her part. Without
                              being rebuffed, they felt themselves constrained to stand aloof. There
                              was nothing of which they could complain; no pretext for resentment
                              —no opening for sarcasm—no material for scandal.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1724">But in proportion to the impotence of malice, so is the malignity of
                              its hoarded venom. All were aware of the political opinions and
                              connexions of Mr. Bernard Trevor; and it was easy to make remarks in
                              the presence of his daughter, not only offensive, but painful to her
                              feelings. To this purpose, no allusion to him was necessary. It was
                              enough to speak injuriously of those whom she knew to be his friends,
                              and whose public characters made them legitimate subjects of applause
                              or censure. By this, and other means of the like character, she was
                              always open to annoyance; and to such means the dastard insolence of
                              those whom her coldness had repelled, habitually resorted for revenge.
                              On such occasions she frequently found that her cousin Douglas came
                              to her aid. Unrestrained by the consideration that imposed silence on
                              her, he was always ready to speak on behalf of the party attacked. If
                              he could not directly vindicate, he would palliate or excuse. If even
                              this were inconsistent with his own opinions, he would take occasion to
                              speak approvingly of the talents or private worth of those who were
                              assailed. Whether she regarded this as a proof of good breeding, or
                              of kindness to herself, or of an incipient change in his opinions, such
                              conduct always commanded her gratitude and approbation.

                           <p id="d2e1756">AMONG those who had thus manifested a disposition to win the favor
                              of Delia Trevor, was a young man who had, not long since, entered
                              public life under the auspices of a father, who, fifteen years before, had
                              openly bartered his principles for office. Besides some talent, the son
                              possessed the yet higher merit, in the eyes of his superiors, of devotion
                              to his party and its leader. He never permitted himself to be restrained,
                              by any regard to time or place, from making his zeal conspicuous.
                              Taught, from his infancy, that the true way to recommend
                              his pretensions was to rate them highly himself, he seemed determined
                              never to exchange his place in the Legislature for any in the gift of
                              the Court, unless some distinguished station should be offered to his
                              acceptance. For any such, in any department, he was understood to
                              be a candidate.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1759">At first, he supposed that a private intimation to this effect, through
                              his father, would be all sufficient. But he was overlooked, and post
                              after post, that he would gladly have accepted, was conferred on others.
                              Fearful that he might be deemed deficient in zeal, he redoubled his
                              diligence, and with increased eagerness sought every opportunity to
                              display his talents and his ardor in the service of his master. Still he
                              seemed no nearer to his object. Whether it was thought that he was
                              most serviceable in his actual station, or that the wily President deemed
                              it a needless waste of patronage to buy what was his by hereditary title
                              and gratuitous devotion, it is hard to say. The gentleman sometimes
                              seemed on the point of becoming malcontent; but his father, who had
                              trained him in the school of Sir Pertinax McSycophant, convinced him
                              that more was to be got by “booing,” and resolute subserviency and
                              flattery of the great, than in any other way. Under such impressions,
                              he would kindle anew the fervor of his zeal and send up his incense in
                              clouds. Again disappointed, and sickening into the moroseness of hope
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1761"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="47" data-tei-n="40"> </a></span>
                              deferred, he would become moody and reserved, as if watching for an
                              opportunity of profitable defection.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1765">Such an opportunity, at such a moment, had seemed to present itself
                              in his acquaintance with Delia Trevor. A connection with her seemed
                              exactly suited to his interested and ambidextrous policy. A handsome
                              and amiable girl were items in the account of secondary consideration.
                              But her fortune was not to be overlooked. Then, should his services,
                              at length, seem like to meet their long deserved reward, she could be
                              presented at court as the niece of Mr. Hugh Trevor, the tried and
                              cherished friend of the President. Should the cold ingratitude of his
                              superiors at length drive him into the opposition for advancement, he
                              was sure of being well received as the son-in-law of a patriot so devoted
                              as Mr. Bernard Trevor. 
                              <foreign id="d2e1767" xml:lang="lat">Utrinque paratus</foreign>, could be secure the hand
                              of Delia, he felt sure that he must win, let the cards fall as they
                              might.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1771">Having taken this view of the subject, and examined it in all its
                              bearings, he made up to Delia with a directness which startled, and a
                              confidence that offended her. But the gentleman had little to recommend
                              him to the favor of the fair. His person was awkward, and disfigured
                              by a mortal stoop. His features, at once diminutive and irregular,
                              were either shrouded with an expression of solemn importance, or
                              set off by a smile of yet more offensive self-complacency. His manners
                              bore the same general character of conceit, alternately pert and grave;
                              and his conversation wavered between resolute, though abortive, attempts
                              at wit, and a sort of chopt logic, elaborately employed in proving,
                              by incontestible arguments, what nobody ever pretended to deny.
                              He had been taught, by his learned and astute father, to lay his
                              foundations so deep that his arguments and the patience of his hearers were
                              apt to be exhausted by the time he got back to the surface of things.
                              Yet he reasoned with great precision, and rarely failed to establish, as
                              unquestionable, the 
                              <hi id="d2e1773">premises</hi> from which other men commonly 
                              <hi id="d2e1776">begin</hi> to

                              one would think. Men like to be confirmed in their opinions; and,
                              the fewer and more simple these may be, the more grateful are they for
                              any thing that looks like a demonstration at their truth. To a man
                              whose knowledge of arithmetic only extends to the profound maxim
                              “that two and two make four,” how gratifying to find a distinguished
                              man condescending to prove it by elaborate argument!

                              discourse. To Delia, therefore, the gentleman, in and of himself, and
                              apart from all extrinsic considerations, was absolutely disagreeable. His
                              first advances drove her within the safe defences of female pride and
                              reserve. But when the manifest audacity of his pretensions led her
                              to think of him as the supple slave of power, as one who had prostituted
                              himself to the service of his master, with an eagerness which condemned
                              his zeal to be its own reward, her disgust increased to loathing,
                              and her pride was kindled into resentment. Without showing
                              more of these feelings than became her, she showed enough to make
                              her the object of his insolent and malignant hatred. but she was
                              fortified by her position in a family which he dared not offend, and his
                              paltry malice found vent in such allusions to the politics of the day as
                              he knew must wound her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1788">Things were about coming to this pass, when Douglas Trevor arrived.
                              The first time he met Mr. Baker in company with his cousin,
                              he saw a disposition on his part to pay attentions which were obviously
                              annoying to her. Both duty and inclination impelled him to come to
                              her relief; and, in doing this, he awakened the jealousy and incurred
                              the displeasure of the gentleman. But these were feelings he had no
                              mind to display toward one who wore a sword, and especially toward
                              the son of a man so influential at Washington as Mr. Hugh Trevor.
                              He accordingly drew off, in morose discomfiture, and Delia, relieved
                              from his offensive attentions, felt that she owed her deliverance to her
                              cousin. He was, of course, bound to occupy the place at her side from
                              which he had driven Baker; and she was bound to requite the service
                              by making the duty he had imposed on himself as little irksome as
                              possible. She exerted herself to be agreeable, and succeeded so well,
                              that Douglas went to bed that night in the firm belief that he had
                              never passed a more pleasant evening, or seen a girl of more charming
                              manners than Delia.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1791">This circumstance led to a sort of tacit convention, which established
                              him in the character of her special attendant, in all parties where Mr.
                              Baker made his appearance. By an easy progress, this engagement
                              was extended to all societies and all places. He knows little of human
                              nature who needs to be told the natural consequences of these
                              things.

                           <p id="d2e1795">But, leaving the reader to form his own judgment, and to anticipate
                              such result as he may, my present business is with the repulsed and
                              irritated Baker. Though it consoled his pride and self-love to impute
                              his discomfitures, not to any absolute dislike of himself, but to a
                              preference for another, there was nothing in that preference to soothe his
                              resentment. As Douglas had, in the first instance, come somewhat cavalierly
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1797"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="49" data-tei-n="42"> </a></span>
                              between him and the object of his wishes, he, perhaps, had reasonable
                              grounds of displeasure against him. But, as it might be quite
                              inconvenient to give vent to his feelings in that direction, they were
                              carefully repressed. In such assaults on those of the lady, as her
                              cousin might not observe, or might think it unwise to notice, did his malice
                              indulge itself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1800">So matters stood when the astounding intelligence reached Richmond,
                              that a diplomatic agent from the State of South Carolina had
                              been long secretly entertained at the Court of St. James, and that he
                              was supposed to have negotiated an informal arrangement for a commercial
                              treaty between that government and the confederacy then forming
                              in the South. Something was rumored as to the terms of the contemplated
                              treaty, which filled the whole northern faction in Virginia
                              with consternation. It was feared that that State could not be withheld
                              from joining the Southern League, except by force, and that, in
                              a contest of force, she would be backed, not only by the Southern
                              States, but by the power of Great Britain.

                           <p id="d2e1825">IT was now the month of February, and a pleasant day had tempted
                              our young people to a jaunt of amusement to the head of the falls.
                              Mr. Baker, stealing away from his duties as a legislator, was one of the
                              party. Repulsed by Delia, he was beginning an attempt on the heart
                              of Virginia, of whose loyalty, as the daughter of Mr. Hugh Trevor, he
                              could entertain no doubt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1828">Here his reception would have been little better than with the other,
                              had not Virginia been held in check by a respect for the supposed
                              opinions of her father. Born at the very moment when the good old
                              gentleman was in the act of making up his mind to sacrifice the
                              sovereignty of his native State to the necessity of preserving the Union,
                              he seemed to seize on the opportunity of compensating the impiety to
                              which he felt himself driven, by giving to his infant daughter the
                              name he had so long cherished and honored. It was a moment of one
                              of those relentings of the heart, in which nature asserts her supremacy,
                              and compels its homage to those whom we have been accustomed to
                              reverence and obey. If even the prodigal or the traitor be subject to
                              be so affected, how much stronger must be such an impulse in the mind
                              of a pure and upright man, impelled by a sense of duty to his country
                              to dishonor her venerated name. This poor tribute was as the kiss
                              of peace with which the executioner implores the pardon of some
                              illustrious victim of State policy, who is about to bleed under his hand.
                              Had he yielded to his feelings, he would have taken up the self-accusing
                              lamentation of the returning prodigal. But his sense of duty was
                              deep and abiding, and was always most sure to command his exact obedience
                              when the duty was most painful. He could not doubt the correctness
                              of a conviction, which even his cherished devotion to his
                              native State could not made him shake off entirely. In such a case, to
                              doubt was, with him, to be convinced.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1832">But the name thus bestowed upon his daughter was not without an
                              effect on her mind. She knew little of politics, but, from her very
                              infancy, self-love had made her jealous of the honor of the State whose
                              name she bore. The name itself was a spell of power on the heart of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1834"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="51" data-tei-n="44"> </a></span>
                              Delia. It had disposed her to love her cousin before she knew her.
                              It had drawn them together on their first acquaintance, and had often
                              been the theme of conversation between them. Somewhat older, and
                              much the superior in intellectual power, Delia had, unwittingly,
                              exercised an influence over the mind of Virginia which inclined her to
                              listen favorably to all that could be urged against the usurper's claim to
                              a dominion, unchecked by the authority of the State.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1837">For more than a year past, Mr. Trevor had himself begun to doubt
                              the wisdom of his former opinions. Doubting, he was silent, but he
                              had not been unwilling to subject his daughter to the action of her
                              cousin's more vigorous mind. For many years, he would as soon have
                              exposed his children to the contagion of the plague, as permit them to
                              visit their uncle. During the last summer he had suffered Arthur and
                              Virginia to spend a month with him; and he was not sorry to observe
                              that the former came home with deeper thoughts than he chose to express.
                              Of their love and admiration of their uncle neither made any
                              secret. He was not only unlike their father, but so unlike any other
                              man, that he had been a curious study to them during their whole visit.
                              The originality of his thoughts, and the vividness with which he expressed
                              them, afforded them constant amusement. He had that faculty
                              of making truth look like truth, in the exhibition of which the young
                              mind so much delights. Then he was so frank, so ardent, and withal
                              so kind, that it was impossible to know and not to love him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1840">After all this, the reader will not be like to partake of the surprise
                              of Mr. Philip Baker, when he found, on shifting his battery, that he
                              was not much more in favor with Virginia Trevor than with her cousin.
                              The consequence was, that whenever he attempted, in company,
                              to attach himself to the immediate party of these young ladies, he was
                              apt to find himself a supernumerary. But, as Virginia had shown no
                              marked dislike to him, his vanity easily adopted the idea that she
                              considered him as the property of Delia. He took some pains to undeceive
                              her, and would have been mortified at her unconcern on the occasion,
                              had he not thought some allowance should be made for her indifference
                              to a man who did but take her as a

                              to hang about, and take his part in conversation, whenever nothing
                              particularly exclusive in the manner of the interlocutors forbade it. He
                              could not come between whispers; but he could answer any observation
                              that met his ear. Being, as I have said, something between a proser
                              and a declaimer, he thought himself eloquent, and would seize occasions
                              to hold forth to the general edification, in a style intended to dazzle
                              the bystanders.

                           <p id="d2e1851">On the day of which we speak, he had been in close attendance on
                              Virginia, until rather by address than by direct repulse, she had
                              contrived to shake him off. It so happened, that the rest of the company
                              were all paired off, leaving him in the enviable condition of a half
                              pair of shears, when relief appeared in the person of a gentleman just
                              from Richmond.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1854">This gentleman, originally one of the devisers of the picnic, had
                              staid behind for the mail, and now arrived with the news alluded to in
                              the last chapter. Baker, being disengaged at the moment, was the
                              first to receive the intelligence, and he lost no time in awakening the
                              attention of the company by volleys of oaths and imprecations. While
                              he continued to exercise himself in calling down the vengeance of
                              “the Eternal,” according to the most approved formula of the old
                              court, on those whom he denounced as traitors, the rest listened in
                              amazement, disgust, or alarm, to this boisterous effusion of his rage.
                              At length, as he stopped to take breath, Douglas availed himself of
                              the pause to ask what was the matter. The whole story now came out,
                              and Mr. Baker, having put his audience in possession of the text, went
                              on with his discourse. Unmindful of the presence of the ladies, he
                              vented his wrath in language with which I do not choose to stain my
                              paper. Every man who had held a conspicuous place among the advocates
                              of State rights for the last twenty years, was condemned, 
                              <hi id="d2e1856" style="font-style: italic;">
                                 
                                 <foreign id="d2e1858" xml:lang="lat">ex cathedra</foreign>
                                 
                              </hi>.
                              The dead were especially recommended to the tender mercies of
                              the devil, in whose clutches he supposed them to be; while the living
                              were indiscriminately devoted to the same doom.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1864">Against the person by whom the treaty was said to have been negotiated,
                              his wrath burned most fiercely. In the midst of one of his
                              most savage denunciations of that gentleman, be happened to recollect
                              having heard Delia speak of him as the intimate friend of her father.
                              The thought turned his eye upon her. She was already pale and
                              trembling with emotion, when she caught his insulting glance. In an
                              instant the blood gushed to her face, and tears to her eyes. He saw
                              it, and went on to comprehend in his denunciations all the aiders,
                              abettors, and 
                              <hi id="d2e1866" style="font-style: italic;">friends</hi> of the 
                              <hi id="d2e1869" style="font-style: italic;">traitor</hi>, whom in one breath he devoted to the
                              gallows.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1873">This was more than Delia could bear, and more than Douglas was
                              disposed to suffer. He had caught the glance which Baker had cast
                              at his cousin; he saw the effect on her feelings; he witnessed her
                              increasing emotion, and felt it his duty to come to her relief. He
                              approached Baker, and passing him, as if with no particular design,
                              touched him gently, and said in a low voice— “Such language is
                              improper in this company.”
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1876"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="53" data-tei-n="46"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1878">“How so,” exclaimed Baker, aloud. “I hope there is no man here
                              disposed to take the part of a traitor.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1881">Douglas turned, and, biting his lip, said in a tone not loud, but from
                              its distinctness and marked emphasis, audible to all present: “I spoke
                              so as to be heard by none but you, and invited you by a sign to go
                              apart where I might explain my meaning in private. But, as you will
                              have the explanation here, I say, that 
                              <hi id="d2e1883" style="font-style: italic;">you know there is no man</hi> here
                              disposed to take the part of a traitor. If you had thought there was,
                              sir, I suspect your denunciations would have been less violent.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1887">“I don't understand you, sir,” said Baker, reddening.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1891">“My meaning is as plain as becomes this presence,” said Douglas,
                              coldly, and again walking away. Baker looked around, and read in
                              every eye that he was expected to follow. He did so, and joining
                              Douglas, they both walked on together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1894">“I shall be glad to receive a farther explanation, sir,” said he in an
                              agitated tone.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1897">“Speak lower, then,” replied Douglas, calmly, slipping his arm
                              within that of Baker; “and use no gesture. My meaning is this—
                              That he who is regardless of the presence and feelings of a lady, is not
                              apt to overlook those of a man. To make my meaning yet plainer,
                              sir, your language would have been more guarded, had my uncle been,
                              represented here, not by a 
                              <hi id="d2e1899" style="font-style: italic;">daughter</hi>, but by a 
                              <hi id="d2e1902" style="font-style: italic;">son</hi>.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1906">The quiet tone of Douglas's voice, the equivocal meaning of the first
                              words he had uttered, and the pacific action intended to deceive those
                              who looked on, had calmed for a moment the alarm of Baker. He
                              had recovered himself before he was made to perceive what was really
                              meant; and ere he had time to reflect on his situation, the dangerous
                              temptation of a repartee assailed him. Glancing back at the company,
                              he said—“If I may judge by appearances, sir, you have the right as
                              well as the inclination to assume that character.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1909">Douglas had turned his head, instinctively, as Baker looked back,
                              and saw that they had rounded a point of rock, and were out of sight.
                              In an instant, he disengaged his arm with a push that nearly threw
                              the legislator down the bank, and stepping back, glared upon him with
                              an eye that instantly brought the other to his senses. While he stood
                              blenching and cowering under this fierce glance, Douglas recovered
                              his self-command, and said, with stern calmness—“You had nearly
                              made me forget myself, sir. But we understand each other now.
                              Take a turn along the shore to compose yourself. I will wait here for
                              you, and we will return to the company together
                              <corr id="d2e1911">.</corr>”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1915">He seated himself on a rock, and the other obeyed mechanically.
                              How he succeeded in recovering his composure is another affair. He
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e1917"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="47"> </a></span>
                              walked on, and on, and fain would he have followed the course of the
                              river to the mountain cave from which it issues, there to hide himself
                              from the consequences of his own folly and impertinence. What
                              would he not have given to recall that last speech? Until then, he
                              was the party aggrieved. Douglas's offence against him had not been
                              so gross as to admit of no explanation; and, to all appearance, an
                              amicable one had been given. The truth might not have come out until
                              he had had time to escape to his constituents; and before the next session
                              the affair might have been forgotten. But now, Douglas had been
                              insulted, and how he felt, and how he would resent the insult, was awfully
                              certain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1921">Baker continued his walk so far, that the girls became uneasy at the
                              absence of the two young men. They begged some of the gentlemen
                              to go in quest of them, but the request was evaded. At last, they rose
                              from their seats on the rocks, and declared they would themselves go.
                              They accordingly set out, followed by the rest, and in a few yards came
                              to where Douglas was quietly seated on a flat stone, and playing checks
                              with pebbles on the smooth sand.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1924">“Where is Mr. Baker?” exclaimed Virginia, eagerly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1927">“Yonder he goes,” replied Douglas, calmly. “He has a mind for
                              a longer walk than I like; and I am just waiting for him here. But
                              I must not detain you, girls. His taste for the picturesque will probably
                              be satisfied by the time we get to our horses, and he will soon overtake
                              us.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1930">He said this with an air so careless as to deceive every person present
                              but Delia. But the heart will speak from the eye, and a glance at
                              her, as she searched his countenance, unconsciously said: “I have
                              redressed you.” Coloring deeply, she strove to hide her emotion—taking
                              his arm and busying herself at the same time with the adjustment of
                              her veil. In spite of some undefined apprehensions, she was grateful,
                              relieved, and pleased; and a slight pressure on the arm she held, spoke
                              her feelings perhaps as distinctly as they were understood by herself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e1933">Douglas returned the pressure with more energy. The words of
                              Baker yet tingled in his ears; and while they burned with the insult,
                              the pain was more than soothed by the thoughts they had awakened.
                              Were then the day-dreams of his boyhood to become realities? He
                              was not, as yet, conscious of any but a cousin's love for Delia. He
                              could impute no other feeling to her. But 
                              <hi id="d2e1935" style="font-style: italic;">should</hi> this mutual affection
                              ripen into a more tender sentiment! With whom could a man pass his
                              days more happily, than with a woman so intelligent, so amiable, so
                              prudent, so much a lady? He did not love her. But he felt that to
                              love her, and be beloved by her, would be a happy lot. The slight

                              weight she rested on his arm was sweet to him. He wished the pressure
                              was heavier. But she walked on, self-poised, and with a light and
                              steady step over the rugged ground. Was not that step more confident,
                              because she felt that he was there to aid her in case of need? Even
                              so, she seemed sufficient for herself in the resources of her own mind.
                              Yet had she needed and accepted, and gratefully, though silently,
                              acknowledged his protection. He was happy in having had occasion to
                              protect her. Was not she the happier for it too? The heart will ask
                              questions. Time gives the answer.

                              found that Douglas had left the room. She ran after him, but he was
                              gone, and for a day or two avoided any opportunity for farther explanation.
                              At length she found one, and asked by what means the paper
                              had been procured.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2005">“By

                           <p id="d2e2014">“Proper!” exclaimed she; “for me to receive, certainly. But for
                              him to give! Indeed, I pity any poor wretch who can be so abject. I
                              am glad, at least, I am to see him no more. I should find it hard to
                              behave to him as becomes myself!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2017">“It would be hard,” said Douglas, “but as you always will behave
                              as becomes yourself, hard though it be, it was right you should be
                              spared the trial.”

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2026">“No questions, coz,” replied Douglas. “I must behave as becomes
                              me too.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2030">This put an effectual stop to farther inquiry, and the slight concealment
                              did but deepen Delia's sense of the service Douglas had rendered
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2032"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="50"> </a></span>
                              her. While she admired the delicacy which, at once, veiled and
                              adorned his chivalrous character; he, on his part felt greater pleasure
                              at having redressed her wrong, because the affair had taken such a turn
                              as to conceal the part that he had acted. The ties thus formed in
                              secret, are doubly sacred and doubly sweet. The heart involuntarily
                              classes them with those chaste mysteries which the vulgar eye must not
                              profane. They become the theme of thoughts which sometimes rise
                              up, and kindle the cheek, and light the eye, and then sink down again
                              and hide themselves deep in the silent breast.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2035">But this privacy was destined to he invaded by one person, at least;
                              and that, the very one from whom Douglas would most anxiously have
                              concealed the whole affair. Yet was there no person to whose tenderness,
                              delicacy, and affection for both parties, it could have been more
                              fitly confided. In short, Mr. Trevor, one day, placed in the hands of
                              his son a letter, in the President's own hand-writing, of which the following

                                       which touches you nearly. Though I receive it at the hands of one
                                       who has the highest claims to my confidence, I yet trust it will prove to
                                       have originated in mistake.

                                    <p id="d2e2056">It is said that your son, Lieutenant Trevor, on receiving the news of
                                       the late treasonable proceedings of some of the southern States, openly
                                       vindicated them; and that he spoke freely in defence of the principal
                                       agent in their most wicked attempt to league themselves with the enemies
                                       of their country. It is said, moreover, that, in doing this, he insulted
                                       and fastened a quarrel on one, whom I have great reason to
                                       esteem for his uniform devotion to the Union. The regular course for
                                       such a charge against an officer, holding a commission in the army of
                                       the United States, is one which I would not willingly pursue, in the
                                       case of the son of one of my earliest and most cherished friends. As
                                       Lieutenant Trevor is now at home, on furlough, I address this letter to
                                       you, to be laid before him. I have no doubt he will readily give the
                                       necessary explanations, and, in so doing, afford me a new occasion for
                                       displaying that regard for you and yours, with which I am,

                              I heard of the events alluded to, I think, I can give a guess at the
                              meaning. It means that my cousin was insulted, in my presence, and
                              that I protected her, as was my duty.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2079">“And how does it happen that I never heard of it? Who was the
                              person, and what has become of the affair?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2083">“It has all blown over,” said Douglas,“and I had hardly expected
                              it would ever be spoken of again. Delia alone knew of it from me, as
                              it was right she should. I have never mentioned, nor has my friend.
                              I am sure she has not; and what the other party can promise himself
                              from the exposure, I am sure I cannot tell.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2086">“The thing is now made public, at all events; and both as your
                              father and as the friend of the President, it is right that I should know
                              all about it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2089">“Certainly, sir,” replied Douglas, “you shall know all; and when
                              you do, I need not explain why I have never told you before.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2092">He left the room, and soon returned with a bundle of papers. From
                              this he handed one to his father, which proved to he a challenge, in
                              the most approved form, from him, the said Douglas Trevor, to Philip
                              Baker, Esq. Then came a proposition to discuss from the other party;
                              then a flat demand of apology, or the alternative of, what is called,
                              gentlemanly satisfaction; then an offer to apologize; then the paper we
                              have already seen; and then the following:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2095">“Philip Baker declares, on his honor, that he meant no offence to
                              Lieutenant Trevor by any words addressed to him on Saturday last;
                              and that he deeply regrets having spoken any which may have sounded
                              offensively in the ears of Lieutenant Trevor.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2098">“This will do,” said Mr. Trevor. “It only shows that you have
                              acted as became a soldier and a gentleman. These papers show clearly
                              that the quarrel began in an insult to your cousin, which you were
                              bound to resent. This will be perfectly satisfactory to the President.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2102">“Doubtless it 
                              <hi id="d2e2104" style="font-style: italic;">would</hi> be,” said Douglas, promptly; “but so much of
                              the affair as implicates my cousin's name must go no farther.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2108">“But it is that,” replied Mr. Trevor, “which shows the cause of the
                              quarrel. The other papers only show that you fancied an intention to
                              insult where none existed. This would tally too well with what the
                              President has heard.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2111">“Be is so,” answered Douglas, calmly. “If the President is never
                              satisfied till I furnish a paper which is to blend my cousin's name with
                              a public discussion, he must remain dissatisfied. I cannot help it.
                              Better to have suffered the insult to pass unnoticed, than to make a
                              lady's name the theme of guard-house wit.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2114">“Bless you, my noble boy,” said the admiring father. “You are
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2116"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="59" data-tei-n="52"> </a></span>
                              right, and there is no help for it. But what shall I say to the
                              President?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2119">“What you please. The

                              he is welcome to. The

                           <p id="d2e2128">“Certainly,” said Mr. Trevor, after a musing pause; “certainly he
                              will trust in my general assurance that his information is, to 
                              <hi id="d2e2130" style="font-style: italic;">my certain

                              <hi id="d2e2133" style="font-style: italic;">will</hi> do. It 
                              <hi id="d2e2136" style="font-style: italic;">must</hi> be sufficient.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2141">“It 
                              <hi id="d2e2143" style="font-style: italic;">must</hi> do,” said Douglas, “whether it will or no. In the mean
                              time, my dear sir, let me beg that the affair may go no farther, even in
                              the family. Delia alone knows of it, and she only knows as much as
                              may be gathered from that paper, a duplicate of which is her's by
                              right. I therefore beg that you will say nothing about it, even to her.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2147">And he did say nothing to her; but Douglas observed, that that
                              night, when she held up her lip for his paternal kiss, the kind old gentleman
                              gave it with more than his usual tenderness. He held her off,
                              parted the hair from her forehead, gazed earnestly and affectionately
                              upon her; and then, kissing her again, bad God bless her, in a voice
                              choked with emotion. From that moment, she was to him as a daughter.

                           <p id="d2e2170">THE visit of Delia to her uncle now drew to a close, and she prepared
                              for her return home. It was settled that she should be accompanied
                              by Douglas, Arthur, and Virginia, who were to spend a few weeks with
                              her father.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2173">On the road, Douglas felt more and more the duty and the privilege
                              of being the protector of his cousin, and, by the time they reached the
                              end of their journey, he had discovered that the latter was as precious
                              as the former was sacred. Some such thought had stolen into his mind
                              while he was yet at home, but that was not the place to mention the
                              subject to her; and he had determined to impose upon himself the
                              most scrupulous restraint, until he should have restored her honorably
                              to her father's arms.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2177">Two days travel brought them to the residence of Mr. Bernard Trevor,
                              on the banks of the Roanoke. They found him laid up with a fit
                              of the gout, which, while it confined him to the house, produced its
                              usual salutary effect on his general health. At the sight of his daughter
                              and her companions, his pain was, for the moment, forgotten; and,
                              flinging away his flannels and crutches, he sprung to his feet and caught
                              her in his arms. At the same time, Arthur and Virginia pressed forward
                              for their welcome, which they, in their turn, received.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2180">Unfortunately, Mr. Trevor was not the only one who forgot himself
                              at the sight of Delia. Poor old Carlo, starting from his slumbers on
                              the hearth-rug, had recognized his young mistress, and was manifesting
                              his joy at her return with boisterous fondness, when one of his feet saluted
                              the inflamed toe of his master. In an agony, which none but
                              they who have felt it can conceive, the old gentleman sunk into his
                              chair. Here he remained for some minutes, unconscious of everything
                              but his sufferings, while the soft hand of his daughter replaced and
                              soothed the tortured limb.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2183">At length, recovering enough to look around him, his eye fell on
                              Douglas, who stood aloof, waiting to be introduced. Some little tag of
                              military foppery, which always clings to the undress of an officer, satisfied
                              Mr. Trevor who he was. Stretching out his hand, he said: “Ah!
                              Douglas, my dear boy! How glad I am to see you! But I ought not
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2185"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="61" data-tei-n="54"> </a></span>
                              to have to recognized you, you dog! standing back therewith your hat
                              under your arm, as if waiting your turn of presentation at a levee.
                              Perhaps you don't remember me. I certainly should not have known
                              you, but for the circumstances under which I see you. But what of 
                              that? Was is not yesterday you were sitting on my knee, and hanging
                              about my neck? Yes, it was yesterday, though we have both dreamed a
                              great deal since. But dreams must give way to realities; so let us vote
                              it yesterday, and meet to-day as we parted last night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2188">This singular 
                              <hi id="d2e2190" style="font-style: italic;">accoste</hi> had the desired effect, and Douglas felt, at once,
                              As if he had been with his uncle all his life.

                           <p id="d2e2194">“You forget, my dear sir,” said he, “that I was intercepted by one
                              whose privilege, I am sure, you would not have me dispute, though he
                              has abused it so cruelly.”

                           <p id="d2e2197">“You mean the dog?” said Mr. Trevor. “Poor old Carlo! Come
                              to your master, my poor fellow! No; your privilege shall never he invaded.
                              We are both past service now, and must learn to sympathize
                              with each other. If you cannot understand the nature of a gouty toe,
                              I hope I shall always have heart enough to understand yours. Give me
                              a rough coat, or a black skin, for a true friend; one that will not grudge
                              any superior advantages that I may possess. Tom,” added he, in a
                              tone of marked gentleness, the fire is low. No, not yourself, old man,”
                              he continued, as the negro whom he addressed moved toward the door;
                              “not you, my good old friend. Just ring the bell, and let one of those
                              lazy dogs in the kitchen bring in some wood. But why don't you speak
                              to your master Douglas? I am sure you remember what cronies you
                              were, when you were teaching him to ride.”

                           <p id="d2e2201">“I'm mighty proud to see you, sir,” said the old man, taking the offered
                              hand of Douglas, with an air of affectionate humility. “But it
                              was not my place, sir,” added he, answering his master's words, “to
                              speak first. I made sure master Douglas would remember me after a

                              house-servant from Caesar Thompson, or any such caricatures, for giving
                              Tom's own words, and his own pronunciation of them. It is not my fault if
                              there is but little peculiarity in his phraseology. His language was never elegant,
                              and frequently ungrammatical. But he spoke better than the peasantry
                              of most countries, though he said some things that a white man would not
                              say; perhaps, because he had some feelings to which the white man is a
                              stranger. A white man, for example, would have said he was 
                              <hi id="d2e2209" style="font-style: italic;">glad</hi> to see
                              Douglas, whether he were so or not. Old Tom said he was 
                              <hi id="d2e2212" style="font-style: italic;">proud</hi> to see him,
                              because he 
                              <hi id="d2e2215" style="font-style: italic;">was</hi> proud to recognize his former pet in the handsome and graceful
                              youth before him.

                              my reins and manage my horse.”

                              that you remember him, if you call him by that name. Tom is Delia's
                              daddy, and Lucia's, and Arthur's, and Virginia's daddy, and so will be
                              to the day of his death. If ever he ceases to he your daddy, too, Douglas,
                              I shall move to reconsider the vote that we just now passed unanimously.”

                           <p id="d2e2227">“It is a vice the northern air has blown upon me,” said Douglas,
                              blushing. “I felt the truth of what you said just now, and am not
                              more sure of being affectionately remembered by any that I used to
                              know, than by my good old daddy.”

                           <p id="d2e2234">“What a graceful and gentlemanly old man!” said Douglas, looking

                              Their characteristic is proud humility. The opposite is servile sulkiness,
                              of which, I suspect, Douglas, you have seen no little.”

                           <p id="d2e2240">“I have seen nothing else,” said Douglas, “among the servants in
                              the North. If the tempers of our negroes were as ferocious, and their
                              feelings as hostile we should have to cut their throats in self-defence
                              in six months.”

                           <p id="d2e2243">“I am glad,” said Mr. Trevor, “that you have not learned to sacrifice
                              your own experience to the fanciful theories of the

                              at least on this point. The time, I hope, will come when you will see,
                              if you do not already, the fallacy of all their cant and sophistry on the
                              subject of domestic slavery. You will then bless God that your lot has
                              been cast where the freedom of all, who, in the economy of Providence,
                              are capable of freedom, is rendered practicable by the particular form
                              in which the subordination of those who must be slaves is cast.”

                           <p id="d2e2253">“Perhaps not,” replied the uncle. “And that reminds me that I am
                              trespassing on forbidden ground. Just there, the differences of opinion
                              between your father and myself commence; and from that point they
                              diverge so much, that I do not feel at liberty to speak to his son on
                              certain topics.”

                              with my father on all subjects; and you would not have me do so, when
                              you thought him wrong. I do not profess to he deeply studied in these

                              matters; but, between your lights and his, I might hope to find my way

                           <p id="d2e2261">“There are some subjects, Douglas,” replied Mr. Trevor, with solemnity,
                              “on which it is better to be in error than to differ, totally and
                              conscientiously, from a father. Delia is but a girl; but should she have
                              come back to me changed in her sentiments (opinions she cannot have)
                              in regard to certain matters, I should feel that I had been grievously
                              wronged by any one who had wrought the change. I know your father
                              has not done this; and I must do as I would be done by, and as I am
                              sure I have been done by.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2264">“I cannot conceive,” said Douglas, “what sort of subjects those can
                              be, concerning which error in opinion is better than truth, under any
                              circumstances.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2267">“Those,” replied Mr. Trevor, “in which truth would bring duty, in
                              conflict with duty.”

                           <p id="d2e2270">“Nay, then,” said Douglas, “there is no danger of my conversion in
                              such cases. I should take that as an infallible proof that doctrines
                              leading to such consequences must be false.”

                           <p id="d2e2274">“Your proposed test of truth is so specious,” observed Mr. Trevor,
                              “that I will go so far as to say one word to convince you of its fallacy.
                              If ever I take you in hand, my lad, my first lesson will be to teach you
                              to examine plausibilities closely, and to distrust summary and simple
                              arguments on topics about which men differ.”

                           <p id="d2e2277">“Does any one, then, maintain,” asked Douglas, “that two opinions
                              which impose conflicting duties can both be right?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2280">“I shall not answer that,” answered Mr. Trevor. “You shall answer
                              it yourself. You are a soldier of the United States. Suppose an
                              insurrection. What, in that case, would be your duty?”

                           <p id="d2e2283">“To fight against the rebels,” replied Douglas, promptly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2286">“And, thinking as you do, so it would be. Now, suppose your father
                              be one of those same rebels.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2289">“I see,” said Douglas, after a pause, in which he colored to the tips
                              of his ears, “I see that you are right.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2293">“In what?” asked Mr. Trevor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2296">“In maintaining,” he replied, “that two opinions which prescribe
                              conflicting duties, may both be right.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2299">“But I have not said so,” replied Mr. Trevor, smiling.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2302">“But you have proved it.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2305">“I am not quite sure of that. Here is another summary and simple
                              looking argument, on a difficult question. My own rule is, ‘
                              <hi id="d2e2307" style="font-style: italic;">distrust
                                 and re-examine.

                              wondering eye. He at length went on—“I shall not break faith with
                              your father by teaching you to think. You have the propositions—
                              and you see there is fallacy somewhere. Analyse the subject, and find
                              your own result. But come, my boy—this is poor entertainment for a
                              hungry traveller. Your aunt has some dinner for you by this time,
                              and here is Tom come to tell us so. Come, give me your arm; and help
                              me to the dining room.”

                              which, she betook herself to the duties of housewifery and hospitality.
                              They found her standing at the back of her chair; and Douglas, as he
                              entered, thought he had rarely seen a more striking figure. She was
                              matronly in her dress and air; tall, majestic, and graceful in her
                              person; and with a countenance beaming with frankness, animation and
                              intelligence. She had been a beautiful woman, and, being much
                              younger than her husband, was still handsome. She extended her
                              hand to Douglas as he entered, and placing him near her, so mingled
                              the courtesy due to a stranger with the cordiality of an old acquaintance,
                              as to make him feel all the comfort and ease of home, without
                              ever losing a sense of that bland influence; which, while it secures
                              decorum, imposes no constraint.

                           <p id="d2e2326">“Would you have known me?” asked the lady.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2329">“I cannot say I could have 
                              <hi id="d2e2331" style="font-style: italic;">identified</hi> you,” he replied, “but I should
                              have recognized you as one I ought to know.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2336">“And your uncle?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2339">“Not by sight, certainly,” said Douglas. “I remember him too
                              distinctly for that. He is too much altered. But I know him by his
                              manners and conversation. These I never could forget; and these are
                              the same, and peculiarly his own. I remember how he used to exercise
                              my mind, and make me talk, and yet never let me talk without
                              thinking.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2342">“And has he been at the old game already?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2345">“O, yes! He has set me to revising and doubting what have seemed
                              to me to be self-evident truths, and proposes to leave me to work out
                              the problem by myself. What conclusion I am to settle in, I cannot
                              guess; but, from present appearances, I shall not be surprised if I go
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2347"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="65" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span>
                              away convinced that I have seven fingers on one hand, and but two on
                              the other—nine in all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2350">“He has not touched on politics?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2353">“O, no! That subject he has 
                              <hi id="d2e2355" style="font-style: italic;">tabooed</hi>, and I am truly sorry for it;
                              for while I never desire to waver in my allegiance to the United States,
                              I am anxious to understand what may become me as a Virginian. If
                              I may judge from what my father says, there is no man from whom I
                              could learn more on that subject than my uncle.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2360">“His lesson would hot be a short one,” replied the lady. “His
                              commandments on behalf of the State are only second in authority
                              with him to the decalogue; and they do not lie in as small a compass.
                              But he fears he might teach you some things your father would wish
                              you to unlearn.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2363">“I am not so sure of that,” answered Douglas. “I meant to say
                              that there is no man whose judgment my father holds in higher
                              respect.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2366">“That is something new,” said Mrs. Trevor, coloring, and with a
                              countenance to which there was some expression of wounded pride. I
                              should be glad to be convinced of that.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2369">“Why should you doubt it?” added the young man, with surprise.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2372">“Because it has not always been so; and, as I claim a woman's
                              privilege to admire my husband above all men, I have felt hurt at it.
                              Your uncle thinks so highly of his brother's wisdom and prudence,
                              that he has always borne to be thought the reverse of him in these
                              things, and quietly submitted to be condemned as a heretic on account
                              of opinions, of the correctness of which he found it impossible to
                              doubt.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2375">“There may have been something of this,” said Douglas, earnestly;
                              “but I assure you it is not so now. I do believe one motive with my
                              father for wishing me to make this visit, is his desire that I should
                              hear both sides; and have the benefit of the sagacity and manly sense
                              which he imputes to my uncle.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2379">“He will have to tell him so plainly,” replied Mrs. Trevor, “before
                              he will open his mouth to you. But I shall be less scrupulous—and I
                              am in daily expectation of a friend whose frankness will leave you no
                              cause to regret your uncle's reserve.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2382">“Who is that?” asked Douglas.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2385">“I shall leave you to find out. You will see many here who feel
                              and think with your uncle, and who come to him to compare thoughts
                              and concert measures. Among them is the man on whom the destinies
                              of his country depend.”
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2388"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="66" data-tei-n="59"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2390">“The only man of whom I should predicate that,” replied Douglas,
                              with some quickness, “is one who, I am very sure, never comes here.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2393">“There is a good and an evil principle,” said Mrs. Trevor. “Events
                              alike depend on both. 
                              <hi id="d2e2395" style="font-style: italic;">You</hi> speak of the one of these—
                              <hi id="d2e2398" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> of the
                              other.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2403">Douglas felt his cheek burn at this remark. His aunt, observing it,
                              added—“You see, you will run the risk of adopting dangerous heresies
                              if you encourage us to be too unreserved. But your candor and
                              good sense may be trusted to lead you right without our guidance.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2406">Douglas felt the truth of the first part of this speech. Whether any
                              thing more than a complimentary turn of expression was meant in the
                              closing words, he did not know. But if the lady intended to express
                              a hope that he might become a convert to the disorganizing notions
                              which he feared were prevalent in her circle, he took the liberty to
                              doubt whether her anticipations would ever be realized. He now
                              changed the conversation and determined to take a second thought
                              before he invited discussions which might mislead him. He found he
                              had to do with active and vigorous minds, against which he might,
                              perhaps, vainly strive to defend himself, even with truth on his side.
                              He resolved, therefore, to yield to the inclination which led him to pass
                              his time with his young friends, and chiefly with Delia.

                              this grave history, if I descended to the particulars of the intercourse
                              between Douglas Trevor and his charming cousin. It is enough to
                              say, that he found himself, daily, more and more happy in her society;
                              and was more and more convinced that it was a necessary ingredient
                              in his happiness. It was not long before he concluded that he would
                              not live without her; and, having told her so, was referred by her to
                              her father.

                           <p id="d2e2438">Nothing doubting that his communication would be favorably received,
                              Douglas was eager to break the matter to his uncle, and ask his
                              approbation of his suit. To his utter amazement, the old gentleman,
                              assuming an air at once serious and tender, said: “My dear boy, had I
                              the world to choose from, there is no man to whom I would sooner trust
                              my daughter's happiness. But circumstances forbid your union. I
                              speak advisedly and sadly. I have seen what was passing. I anticipated
                              this communication, and deliberately decided on my answer.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2442">“For God's sake, sir!” exclaimed Douglas, trembling with impatience,
                              “what do you mean; and what is your answer?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2445">“I mean,” said Mr. Trevor, “and my answer is, that circumstances
                              forbid it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2448">“Surely,” said Douglas “your objection is not to the nearness of
                              blood.”

                              Trevor. “But my daughter must never marry one that wears that
                              dress.”

                           <p id="d2e2454">“I like my profession, sir,” said Douglas, but will change it without
                              hesitation.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2457">“God forbid!” replied the old gentleman. “I would not have you
                              do so; and were you so inclined, it would not be in your choice.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2461">“I can resign when I will, and my resignation will certainly be
                              accepted.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e2466">“Still you would be a soldier, and you must be a soldier. Peace is
                              not in our choice, and the time is at hand when every man, who can
                              wield a sword, must do so.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2469">“I do not understand you, sir,” said Douglas in amazement.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2472">“I am aware you do not. It is time you should. You have now a
                              right to understand me; and I have a right to be understood by you.
                              We are on the eve of what you will call rebellion. I shall call it a
                              war of right and liberty. I am old and infirm; but I am not always
                              imprisoned by the gout; and nothing but physical inability
                              shall keep me from sustaining, with my sword, a cause that I have
                              always advocated with tongue and pen. It will be bad enough to
                              meet the sons of my brother in arms against my country. That I cannot
                              help. But it is in my choice whether I shall thus meet my
                              daughter's husband. That must never be.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2475">He ceased to speak, and the young man, dizzy with mixed thoughts
                              and feelings, sat gazing him in mute astonishment. At length, starting
                              up, he was about to leave the room, when the old gentleman held
                              out his hand. Douglas gave his, and his uncle, pressing it cordially,
                              went on: “My son,” said he, “you are the only male of my race in
                              whom I recognize any thing which tells me that the same blood flows
                              in our veins. We cannot help the selfishness that disposes us to love
                              those who resemble us even in our faults. It might be better for you
                              not to resemble me, and perhaps I ought to wish that you did not. But
                              I cannot. I find it easier to forget that you are not my son, and to
                              love you as if you were. The hope that you may yet be so, is hardly
                              less dear to me than to you. That you will be so, if ‘you outlive the
                              envy’ of those awful events which shall open your eyes, I can hardly
                              doubt. But these things must do their work. The convictions which
                              shall make you throw off the badges of allegiance to him whose
                              sworn foe I am, must come of themselves. While you wear them, I
                              am bound to respect your honor by saying nothing to shake your faith
                              in him, and to his cause. In the mean time, I can but hope for the
                              best. I do hope; and I invite you to hope. But for the present, hope
                              must be our all. Things must remain as they are until it pleases God
                              so to order events as to make your sense of duty to your country
                              consistent with that which, as my daughter's husband, you will owe to her
                              and to her father.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2479">I leave the reader to imagine the consternation of Douglas at this
                              decisive condemnation of his proposed plan of happiness, and at the
                              astounding intelligence that accompanied it. He saw plainly that his
                              uncle spoke not conjecturally, but from certain knowledge; and he was
                              sure, that under such circumstances, no attachment could tempt Delia
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2481"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="69" data-tei-n="62"> </a></span>
                              to marry him. He did not therefore attempt to continue the discussion
                              of the subject, but left the house and wandered into the fields.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2484">The tumult of his mind rendered him incapable of reflection. I
                              shall not attempt to analyze the chaos of his thoughts. But light, not
                              darkness, floated on the surface. The hand of Delia was indeed withheld
                              for a season, but he was not forbidden to hope that it might one
                              day or other be his. Should it even be true that rebellion was awake,
                              and that civil war was at hand, he was not told that fidelity to his
                              standard would he imputed to him as a crime. The strife must end
                              one way or the other, and that being past, he would no longer be
                              condemned to the hard alternative of relinquishing the object of his most
                              ardent wish, or exhibiting the shocking spectacle of a husband warring
                              against the father of his wife.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2487">But what was to be done in the mean time? Should the old gentleman
                              take the field, he must find some other theatre of action, and
                              his father's influence with the President would readily procure him
                              that indulgence. As to the idea of renouncing what he had been
                              taught to call his allegiance to the Federal Government, and aiding to
                              maintain the dishonored sovereignty of his native State, it did not
                              enter his mind. Yet there was something in its workings that suddenly
                              awakened an undefined interest in the late correspondence between
                              his father and the President. He no sooner thought of this, than his
                              restless wanderings received a definite direction to the neighboring
                              post-office.

                              the copy of one from the President. Its contents were as follows:

                                       whom I feel myself bound to consult, it is not so. Such of them, indeed
                                       as are acquainted with your high character, do not intimate a
                                       doubt that a full explanation of the affair would entirely justify your
                                       assurance that I have been misinformed.

                                       of it, I may estrange a friend, whom they regard as hardly less
                                       valuable and meritorious than him whose feelings I wish to save. They
                                       represent, moreover, that the affair is bruited in the army, and that
                                       some officers are malcontent at the thought that a charge so serious
                                       should be passed over without enquiry, on the bare assurance of a
                                       father's confidence in the innocence of his son.

                           <p id="d2e2541">“The discretion, good sense, and proper feeling you have already
                              manifested in this affair, have been so conspicuous, that I choose rather
                              to trust its future conduct entirely to yourself than to embarrass you
                              by any advice of mine. Yet, there is one person, my dear boy, with
                              whom I would have you to advise. Your uncle has been a soldier in
                              his youth, and is profoundly versed in all matters of military etiquette.
                              He is, moreover, a clear-sighted and sagacious man, who will, at once,
                              see this matter in all its bearings and relations to other subjects. His
                              views are not only, in general, more comprehensive than mine, but I
                              suspect he is, at this moment, aware of considerations which might
                              properly influence you, and which are hidden from me. I know his
                              guarded and delicate reserve, in all his communications with my children,
                              where he apprehends a difference of opinion between himself and
                              me. Tell him that he has my thanks for it; but that I shall be yet
                              more obliged, if, in this instance, he will cast it aside entirely, and
                              give you the benefit of all his thoughts, as if you were 
                              <hi id="d2e2543" style="font-style: italic;">his own</hi> son. I
                              fear my last days may be spent in bitter regrets that I myself have not
                              heretofore made more avail of them.”

                           <p id="d2e2573">THE evening was far advanced when Douglas again reached his
                              uncle's house. He went immediately to his room, and sent to request
                              a private interview with Mr. Trevor. He was accordingly invited into
                              the little study of the old gentleman, where he commonly sat surrounded
                              by books and papers. On entering the room, he observed an
                              elderly gentleman, whom he had never seen before, pass out at a door
                              communicating with the drawing-room.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2576">Douglas now silently handed his father's letter to his uncle. Mr.
                              Trevor read it attentively, and again and again looked over it, resting
                              his eye on particular passages, as if to possess himself of the full
                              meaning of every expression. The subject was in itself interesting, and
                              quite new to him. But he felt a yet deeper interest in the obscure
                              intimations of a change in his brother's mind in regard to those matters
                              about which they had so long and so painfully differed. Even if he
                              was mistaken in this, it was consoling to find himself rising in the
                              estimation of Mr. Hugh Trevor; no longer regarded by him as rash,
                              reckless, and inconsiderate, but consulted as a “clear-sighted and sagacious
                              man” in an affair of very great importance. He alone, who has been
                              conscious of being thus undervalued by a friend at once beloved and
                              respected, can estimate the satisfaction which Mr. Trevor felt at that
                              moment. If there was any mixture of alloy with this pleasure, it
                              flowed from self-reproach. He had sometimes found it impossible to
                              repress some little risings of resentment at finding his judgment habitually
                              disabled by his elder brother. He had, indeed, been once a
                              little white-headed boy, when the other was a highly intelligent and
                              promising youth. But at sixty he was not quite content to be still
                              looked on as a child. Yet, when he remarked the candor of his brother's
                              language, and the self-abasing sadness of his tone, he was vexed
                              to think that one unkind thought toward him had ever entered his
                              mind.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2580">At length, he interrupted this train of thought to ask of Douglas an
                              explanation of the President's letter. In answer, he received a detailed
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2582"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span>
                              account of the scene at the falls, and was permitted to read the
                              correspondence which had grown out of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2585">“I have heard something of this before,” said Mr. Trevor. “Delia
                              told me all that passed in her presence, and showed me Baker's palinode,
                              which is rather the most extraordinary document that I ever saw.
                              Why, the dog acknowledges that he actually intended to insult a lady.
                              He might, at least, have had the grace to lie about it. 
                              <hi id="d2e2587" style="font-style: italic;">False</hi> shame is
                              better than no shame at all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2591">“He would have been glad to put the matter on that footing,” said
                              Douglas, “could he have got leave to do so. He sent me such a paper
                              as you suppose, but I refused to receive it. His apology to me I knew
                              to be false. It was, therefore, the more satisfactory because the more
                              humiliating. But I sent him word that I would not take anything to
                              my cousin but the truth. Here,” continued Douglas, “is his first project
                              of an apology, and of my rejection of it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2594">Mr. Trevor read them, and then said: “This is well. I knew you
                              had acted handsomely, but 
                              <hi id="d2e2596" style="font-style: italic;">how</hi> handsomely, I had not conceived of.
                              But let me hear, I pray you, how all this has been tortured into an
                              offence against majesty.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2600">Douglas colored slightly at the word, and handed his uncle a copy of
                              the President's first letter to his father. He had but to add an account
                              of his subsequent conversation with his father, and Mr. Trevor was in
                              possession of the whole affair.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2603">“You see,” said Douglas, “that I am referred to you for advice, and
                              that you are invited to say to me, unreservedly, what you will.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2607">“I do see,” replied Mr. Trevor, “that I have

                              as depends on your father; but there are some things I would

                              ever imposed on me I now shake off. Indeed, I should have done this
                              now, without his permission. You are my son as well as his. You
                              have shown that you know how to protect my daughter, and have fairly
                              earned a right to protect her through life. Nay, no raptures, no thanks.
                              The exercise of this right must he postponed until affairs have taken a
                              different shape from that they bear at present. But,

                           <p id="d2e2638">“I mean,” replied the other, “the President and the elder Baker,
                              that tame slave of power, that shameless, mercenary pander, who, having
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2640"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="73" data-tei-n="66"> </a></span>
                              both talent and reputation, sold the one and sacrificed the other for
                              office and infamy.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2643">“And is it for such a man,” exclaimed Douglas, “that I am required
                              to make disclosures before a court of inquiry, or a court martial, which
                              delicacy and self-respect forbid? Never! Be the alternative what it
                              may, I shall never consent to it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2646">“You are right, my son,” said Mr. Trevor, “nor can I relieve you
                              from the difficulty by authorizing the profanation of my daughter's
                              name, to which such an investigation would lead. My duty on that
                              head is peremptory, not discretionary. If your father were anything
                              but the perfect gentleman he is, I might suspect that his reference to
                              me was intended to elicit some such suggestion. But I know him better.
                              I infer from his letter more than you discover there; and I am
                              not sure that the advice which I am most disposed to give, is that
                              which he would be best pleased to see you follow.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2649">“What would that advice be?” asked Douglas, anxiously.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2653">“Nay,” replied the old gentleman, “when I have made up my mind,
                              you shall know.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2656">“But why not give me your thoughts,” said the youth, “and let us
                              discuss them?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2659">“Because, circumstanced as you are, we cannot properly discuss
                              them. I can but give you my judgment, when I have formed it, and
                              leave you to find out reasons for it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2662">“My own first thought,” said Douglas, “is to resign. Let us
                              discuss that.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2665">“It was mine too,” said the uncle, “and there is therefore no occasion
                              to discuss it. Though I had not sufficiently matured my opinion
                              to announce it to you, I think I may promise that if you come to that
                              conclusion, I shall not dissent from it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2668">“The only difficulty that I see in the way,” said Douglas, “is that
                              an offer to resign is, under such circumstances, generally understood as
                              a shrinking from inquiry.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2672">“It is so; and the opinion is so far right, that when the charge is
                              infamous, resignation doubles the infamy. It is a tacit consent to be
                              infamous, only on condition that one may be safe.”

                              make it your duty (not to the United States, but to Virginia and to
                              yourself,) to resign. Now, it is because I have no mind to seduce a
                              soldier from his standard, that I have been careful not to infuse such
                              sentiments into you. If once you lay aside the panoply of the uniform,
                              and throw away the amulet of the commission, I would not ensure you
                              against opinions which you may have to maintain at the hazard of your
                              life. But time presses. Your own suggestion disposes me to speak
                              more promptly and decidedly than I should otherwise have done. I
                              therefore say, tender your resignation. But, if you have no objection,
                              I should like to consult a friend, on whose most hasty opinions I rely
                              more than on the coolest judgment of others.”

                              intimate friend, who propose to ask his advice. Charge that matter to
                              my account, then, and merely decide for yourself, whether it may not
                              be desirable to have the counsel of one as remarkable for scrupulous
                              delicacy, as for sagacity and resource?”

                           <p id="d2e2708">“There can be but one answer to that question,” replied Douglas,
                              “and I shall therefore gladly take the benefit of his advice.”

                           <p id="d2e2712">The hand-bell sounded, and the ever ready Tom appeared. “My
                              respects to Mr. B—,” said Mr. Trevor. “Ask him, if he pleases, to
                              walk into this room.”

                              was a man apparently of sixty years of age, or more, slightly formed,
                              but tall, erect, clean-limbed, and sinewy. His vigor seemed little
                              impaired by time, though his high and strong features made him look at
                              least as old he was. A light blue eye, clear and sparkling, quick in its
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2717"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="75" data-tei-n="68"> </a></span>
                              glance, but settled and searching in its gaze, was the striking feature of
                              his face. The sun had burned out all traces of his original complexion,
                              and a silver hue had usurped the color of his hair. His whole appearance
                              was imposing, and while it commanded the respect due to the wisdom
                              of age, seemed to claim no pity for its infirmities. To this sentiment,
                              which enters so largely into the composition of that character which the
                              world calls 
                              <hi id="d2e2719">venerable</hi>, he certainly made no pretensions . No one would
                              have called 
                              <hi id="d2e2722" style="font-style: italic;">him</hi> venerable, though no man was held in higher veneration

                              Douglas, gave assurance that he took a great interest the young man,
                              who felt, on his part, that he was in the presence of a man of no common
                              mould, and that in that man he had found an efficient friend.

                           <p id="d2e2755">Tom bowed and withdrew, and Mr. Trevor, without preface or
                              apology, proceeded to lay the case before his friend. This he did with
                              great precision of statement, while the other listened with an air which
                              showed that no word was lost on him. Having got through, Mr. Trevor
                              added: “We now wish you to advise what should he done in this
                              case.”

                           <p id="d2e2758">“Resign, by all means,” said Mr. B—. “Resign immediately!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2761">“Your reasons?” asked Mr. Trevor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2764">“There are plenty of them, of which you are aware,” said B—, “and
                              with which our young friend shall be made acquainted after resignation,
                              not before. But there are others which may be spoken of now.
                              The alternative is a court of inquiry, a court-martial, or resignation.
                              To the two first the same objection applies. Your nephew cannot expect
                              any satisfactory result from either, but by the use of means which,
                              I am sure, his delicacy would not permit him to use—I mean the public
                              use of a lady's name. Some people have a taste for that, and in
                              other parts of the world it is all the rage. I thank God that the fashion
                              has not reached us. A woman, exposed to notoriety, learns to bear
                              and then to love it. When she gets to that, she should go North;
                              write books; patronize abolition societies, or keep a boarding-school.
                              She is no longer fit to be the wife of a Virginia gentleman. But there
                              is no need to say this. You, Trevor, were your nephew so inclined,
                              would never permit the name of your daughter to he thus profaned.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2767">“I could oppose nothing to it,” said Mr. Trevor, “but my displeasure.
                              And though I might not wish it, could I have a right to be displeased
                              with Douglas for vindicating himself from a charge which has
                              grown out of his gallant defence of her? Think of the favorable standing
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2769"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="70"> </a></span>
                              of his family; observe the rapid promotion of his brother; and
                              consider whether a punctilio of this sort should bind him to renounce
                              prospects so flattering?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2772">“Were the prospect more flattering than you state it,” said B—, “it
                              would not change my opinion. But what prospect is there? Colonel
                              Trevor is perhaps a favorite at court. So, doubtless, is your brother;
                              but he is not a man whose fidelity is either to be bought or rewarded;
                              and he and his will be, at any moment, postponed and sacrificed to the
                              mercenary, who might desert and even mutiny for want of pay. Here
                              is proof of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2776">“Look at the shallow pretext for this proposed court-martial. The
                              President is pleased to say that he believes your brother; but that
                              
                              <hi id="d2e2778" style="font-style: italic;">there are those</hi> who do not. Who are they? Who can they be? Who
                              is there, worthy to be accounted among his advisers, that can disbelieve
                              anything that Hugh Trevor shall assert? Don't you see the
                              cheat? Don't you see that your brother, whose attachment to the
                              Union, based as it is on principle, may be safely trusted, is to have his
                              feelings wounded to gratify the mortified pride of the elder Baker, and
                              the skulking malice of his son? You, Mr. Trevor, know better than
                              I do who are about the President. Is there one among them to whom
                              your father's word would need the support of other testimony? Good
                              old man! So little has he of pride or jealousy, that this thought never
                              occurs to him. He is modestly asking himself what right he has to
                              expect credence from those who do not know him. And who are these
                              malcontent officers? Think you there is one of them who would venture
                              to express his dissatisfaction to you? No. There is no one malcontent.
                              No one dissatisfied but that son of the horse-leech, whose
                              mouth is ever agape, and never can he filled.

                              “How perfectly in character. Not one traversable allegation (as the
                              lawyers say) except that of his friendship for your brother. ‘Those
                              friends whom I feel bound to consult!’ Who are they? Press him,
                              and I dare say some fellow below contempt, some scullion of the kitchen
                              political or the kitchen gastronomical, may be found to father what it
                              is alleged that these friends have said. ‘His information is from a
                              source entitled to all confidence!’ Does he even say that as of himself?
                              No. He charges that, too, on his friends, though it might not be easy
                              to find a sponsor for that compliment to old Baker. Since the death of
                              his brother pimp Ritchie, I think that sort of thing has gone out of
                              fashion. ‘Hardly less valuable and meritorious than your brother.’
                              The same authority. ‘
                              <hi id="d2e2784" style="font-style: italic;">On dit,</hi>’ ‘
                              <hi id="d2e2787" style="font-style: italic;">they say</hi>’ I think this last 
                              <hi id="d2e2790" style="font-style: italic;">On</hi> would
                              he as hard to find as that universal author of mischief, Nobody.

                           <p id="d2e2796">“But when we come to the dissatisfaction of the army, it is worse
                              still. Here is

                              is dissatisfied; and such are the gossamer threads, woven into a veil to
                              hide this insult to your brother, and this indignity to your nephew.
                              Take away these, and what remains but a wish to soothe Baker? And
                              what must be the force of those favorable dispositions to your young
                              friend, which are to be counteracted by such a motive? By a reluctance
                              to offend an abject wretch too spiritless to resent, and without
                              influence to make his resentment at all formidable.”

                              Trevor. “Had you dissented, we would have reconsidered the matter.
                              As it is, we are but confirmed in our decision.”

                              that the thing admits of no doubt with me. I am not only sure that,
                              in resigning, your nephew will do what best becomes him as a gentleman,
                              but that he will make a fortunate escape from the services of one
                              whose maxim it is to reward none but the mercenary.”

                           <p id="d2e2818">“Then go to work, my boy,” said Mr. Trevor; “the mail goes at
                              daylight. Enclose your letter of resignation, unsealed, in one to your
                              father. I will have them mailed to-night, and you will get an answer
                              in a week. Here are the materials. Write, and we will chat and take
                              our coffee. By the way, Douglas, you have not dined.”

                           <p id="d2e2824">“Be it so,” said the old gentleman. “It is not so long since I was
                              young but that I understand your trim. Starving is better than
                              blood-letting, and a full heart needs the one or the other.”

                           <p id="d2e2827">When Douglas's letters were finished, he would gladly have put them
                              into Delia's hands before he sent them off; but he found, what most
                              men have been surprised to find, that after what had passed in the
                              morning between him and Delia, it was much harder to obtain an interview
                              with her than before. When a young gentleman makes a visit
                              of some days to a friend in the country, whose daughter suspects that
                              he has something to say to her that she is impatient to hear, it is
                              amusing to see how many chances will bring them together. Each of
                              them is always happening to have some call to go where the other happens
                              to be; and when together, each is apt to be detained in the room
                              by some interesting occupation until the rest of the company have left
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2829"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="79" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span>
                              it. They are continually meeting in passages and on stair-cases; and,
                              in pleasant weather, they are almost sure to stroll into the garden about
                              the same time. But let the decisive word be once spoken, and all is
                              changed. Then, bless us, how we blush! and how we glide through
                              half-open doors, and slip away around corners!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2833">Still it will happen, as love makes people restless, that both will rise
                              early, and so meet in the parlor before others are awake. And then
                              there is “the dewy eve and rising moon,” and the quiet walk “by
                              wimpling burn and leafy shaw;” but as to a private word in the bustling
                              hours of the day, that is out of the question.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2836">All this is the result of sheer accident. See how innocent and artless
                              she looks! And how light and elastic is her step as she moves
                              along; her swan-like neck outstretched, her face slightly upturned,
                              her eye swimming in light, and looking as if the veil of futurity were
                              raised before her, and all the gay visions of hope stood disclosed in
                              bright reality. Is she not beautiful? O, the charm of mutual love!
                              Who can wonder that each man's mistress, wearing this Cytherean
                              zone, is, in his eyes, the Queen of Beauty herself?

                           <p id="d2e2839">But I forget myself. What place for thoughts like these in a chronicle
                              of wars and revolutions? True, it is in such causes that the spring
                              of great events is found; but these belong to the history of man in all
                              ages, in all countries, under all circumstances. It was so “

                              unprofitable to look into the chain of cause and consequence, and to trace
                              the deliverance of Virginia from thraldom, and the defeat of the usurper's
                              well-laid plans, to the impertinent speech of one of his minions to a
                              country girl, during a

                              meeting Delia the next morning, put it into her hands. She read it
                              with a grave and thoughtful countenance, and then, looking sadly in
                              his face, said: “This is what I feared.”

                           <p id="d2e2861">“How can it be so?” she replied. “But yesterday we spoke on this
                              subject. What has since happened? O! can it be that my noble
                              father has imposed dishonorable conditions, and that you have been
                              weak enough to comply with them? O! Douglas! Is my love fated
                              to destroy the very qualities that engaged it?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2864">“Dear Delia,” said Douglas, “I understand you now. Your beautiful

                              “What can have passed?” asked she, with earnest and reproachful
                              sadness. “All the eloquence and address of Mr. B—himself could
                              not have convinced your unbiassed mind in two hours' conversation. I
                              know his power. I know the wonders he has wrought, and I trembled
                              when I heard the watchword, “coffee and privacy.” I feared your
                              love for me might be used to sway your judgment, and hoped to have
                              found an opportunity to invoke it for the worthier purpose of guarding
                              your honor. I did not dream that, when I rose so early this morning,
                              I was already too late.”

                              said Douglas, playfully. “Your indignation is so eloquent, that, cruel
                              as it is, I would not interrupt you to undeceive you. Your father and
                              Mr. B—have made no attack on my opinions or allegiance, and what
                              was done last night you have had no agency in, since our party at the
                              falls. It all originated there.”

                              convincing her that his standard of honor was even higher than she
                              had imagined. If she requited him for her unjust suspicions with
                              a kiss, he never told of it. Perhaps she did; for although, according
                              to the refinements of the Yankees, kissing was in very bad taste, yet the
                              Northern regime had not reached the banks of the Roanoke. The
                              ladies there continued still to walk in the steps of their chaste mothers,
                              safe in that high sense of honor which protects at once from pollution
                              and suspicion.

                           <p id="d2e2875">It is true, that when a people become corrupt, they must learn to be
                              fastidious, and invent safeguards to prevent vice, and blinds to conceal
                              it when it is to be indulged. Duennas are necessary in Spain. They
                              are at once the guarantee of a lady's honor, and the safe instruments
                              of her pleasures. Black eunuchs perform the same functions in Turkey.
                              In the Northern factories boys and girls are not permitted to
                              work together. In their churches, the gentlemen and ladies do not
                              sit in the same pew. What a pitch of refinement! Sterne's story of
                              the Abbe in the theatre at Paris affords the only parallel.

                              continuous contact through all grades and ranks. If it were true, as the
                              wise and eloquent, and pious, and benevolent, and discreet Dr. Channing
                              had said, some fifteen years before, that below a certain line all
                              was corrupt, it was equally true that above it all was pure. Nature
                              had marked the line, and established there a boundary which the gangrene
                              of the social body could never pass.

                           <p id="d2e2917">ON the evening of the third day from that of which I have just
                              been speaking, the President of the United States was sitting alone in
                              a small room in his palace, which, in conformity to the nomenclature of
                              foreign courts, it had become the fashion to call his closet. The
                              furniture of this little apartment was characterized at once by neatness,
                              taste, and convenience. Without being splendid, it was rich and
                              costly; and, in its structure and arrangement, adapted to the use of a
                              man, who, devoted to business, yet loved his ease. The weariness of
                              sedentary application was relieved by the most tasteful and commodore
                              variety of chairs, couches, and sofas, while the utmost ingenuity
                              was displayed in the construction of desks, tables, and other conveniences
                              for reading and writing. In the appearance of the distinguished
                              personage, to whose privacy I have introduced the reader, there was a
                              mixture of thought and carelessness very much in character with the
                              implements of business and the appliances for ease and comfort which
                              surrounded him. He occasionally looked at his watch, and at the door,
                              with the countenance of one who expects a visiter; and then throwing
                              himself against the arm of his sofa, resumed his disengaged air. That
                              something was on his mind was apparent. But, interesting as the subject
                              might be, it did not seem to touch 
                              <hi id="d2e2919" style="font-style: italic;">him</hi> nearly. His whole manner
                              was that of a man who is somewhat at a loss to know what may be
                              best for others, but finds full consolation in knowing precisely what is
                              best for himself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2923">As the events of the last ten years make it probable that none of
                              my younger readers have ever seen the august dignitary of whom I
                              speak, and as few of us are like to have occasion to see him in future,
                              a particular description of his person may not be unacceptable. Though
                              far advanced in life, he was tastily and even daintily dressed, his whole
                              costume being exactly adapted to a diminutive and dapper person, a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2925"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="82" data-tei-n="75"> </a></span>
                              fair complexion, a light and brilliant blue eye, and a head which might
                              have formed a study for the phrenologist, whether we consider its ample
                              developments or its egg-like baldness. The place of hair was supplied
                              by powder, which his illustrious example had again made fashionable.
                              The revolution in public sentiment which commenced sixty years ago,
                              had abolished all the privileges of rank and age; which trained up the
                              young to mock at the infirmities of their fathers, and encouraged the
                              unwashed artificer to elbow the duke from his place of precedence;
                              this revolution had now completed its cycle. While the sovereignty of
                              numbers was acknowledged, the convenience of the multitude had set
                              the fashions. But the reign of an individual had been restored, and
                              the taste of that individual gave law to the general taste. Had he
                              worn a wig, wigs would have been the rage. But as phrenology had
                              taught him to be justly proud of his high and polished forehead, and
                              the intellectual developments of the whole cranium, he eschewed hair
                              in all its forms, and barely screened his naked crown from the air with
                              a light covering of powder. He seemed, too, not wholly unconscious
                              of something worthy of admiration in a foot, the beauty of which was
                              displayed to the best advantage by the tight fit and high finish of his
                              delicate slipper. As he lay back on the sofa, his eye rested complacently
                              on this member, which was stretched out before him, its position
                              shifting as if unconsciously, into every variety of grace. Returning
                              from thence, his glance rested on his hand, fair, delicate, small, and
                              richly jewelled. It hung carelessly on the arm of the sofa, and the
                              fingers of this, too, as if rather from instinct than volition, performed
                              sundry evolutions on which the eye of majesty dwelt with gentle
                              complacency.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2929">This complacent reverie was frequently broken by the sound of the
                              door-bell. At such moments, the President would raise his head with
                              a look of awakened expectation, which subsided instantly; until, by
                              frequent repetition, it called up some expression of displeased
                              impatience. At last, the sound was echoed by a single stroke, which rung
                              from what looked like a clock within the room. He immediately sat
                              erect, assuming an air of dignified and complacent composure, suited
                              to the reception of a respected visiter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2932">The door opened, and the gentleman in waiting bowed into the room
                              a person who well deserves a particular description, and then withdrew.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2935">The individual thus introduced was a gentleman whose age could not
                              be much short of severity. In person he had probably been once
                              nearly six feet high, but time had at once crushed and bowed him to a
                              much shorter stature. Indeed, the stoop of his shoulders, the protrusion
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2937"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="83" data-tei-n="76"> </a></span>
                              of the neck, and the projecting position of the chin, made together
                              that peculiar complex curvature which brings the top of the
                              cape of the coat exactly against the top of the head. The expression
                              of his countenance was, at once, fawning and consequential. His face
                              had been originally something between round and square. If was now
                              shortened by the loss of his teeth. The muscular fullness of youth
                              had not been replaced by any accession of fat, nor had the skin of his face
                              shrunk, as it often does, on the retiring flesh. The consequence was,
                              that his checks hung down in loose pouches, and all his features,
                              originally small and mean, seemed involved in the folds of his shrivelled
                              and puckered skin. His voice was harsh and grating, and the
                              more so from an attempt at suavity in the tones, which produced nothing
                              more than a drawling prolongation of each word. Thus, though
                              he spoke slowly, the stream of sound flowed continually from his lips,
                              reminding the hearer of the never-ending chant of the locust.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2940">As the President rose and gracefully advanced to welcome him, he
                              shuffled forward as if wishing to prevent the honor thus done him,
                              while the increased curve of his back and the eager humility of his
                              upturned countenance, betokened the prostration of his spirit in the
                              presence of the dispenser of honor and emolument. Having bowed
                              himself on the hand which had been graciously extended to him, he
                              remained standing in the floor as if unmindful of repeated invitations
                              to be seated. The President had not yet so entirely forgotten the
                              manners which once distinguished him as a most accomplished gentleman,
                              and was not at first aware of the necessity of seating himself before
                              his deferential guest. At length, he resumed his place on the
                              sofa, and then the other, with a new prostration, which seemed to
                              apologize for sitting in the presence of majesty, followed his example. He
                              did not; indeed, presume to share the sofa, though invited to do so, but
                              took his place on a seat equally luxurious on the opposite side of the
                              fire-place. But the luxury of the 
                              <foreign id="d2e2942" xml:lang="fre">chaise longue</foreign> was lost on him. He
                              felt that to lean against the back or arm would be quite unbecoming,
                              and sat as nearly erect as he could, in that precise posture which
                              indicates a readiness to spring to the feet and do the bidding of a superior.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2946">“I had begun to despair of seeing you this evening, my dear sir,”
                              said the President, in a tone at once kind and reproachful. “I had
                              given orders that I should be denied to all but you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2949">“You do me great and undeserved honor,” replied the other, “but
                              I—”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e2953">“I wished to speak to you in private,” continued Mr. Van Buren,
                              not noticing the interruption, “of a matter which deeply interests us
                              both. Here is a letter which I received this morning, which makes it
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e2955"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="84" data-tei-n="77"> </a></span>
                              at least doubtful whether the last step which I took in regard to that
                              young man, Trevor, is quite such as should have been taken.”

                                       been made against Lieutenant Trevor, which, it seems, grow out of
                                       certain occurrences to which I am privy. I can have little doubt that
                                       the affair, to which I allude, has not been truly reported to you. Had
                                       it been, you would have seen that Lieutenant T. acted no otherwise
                                       than as became a soldier and a gentleman, in whose presence a lady, under
                                       his protection, had been insulted. The enclosed documents, to the
                                       authenticity of which I beg leave to testify, will place the transaction in
                                       its true light. Were Lieutenant T. at Washington, I should not lay
                                       these papers before you without authority from him. As it is, I trust
                                       I do no more than my duty by him, and by your Excellency, in furnishing
                                       such evidences of the real facts of the case, as may aid you in
                                       deciding on the course to be pursued in regard to it.
                                    </p>

                                       friend on the occasion, these documents were left in my possession in
                                       that character. It is this same character, in which I feel it especially
                                       my duty to step forward as the guardian of his honor and interests.

                           <p id="d2e2997">Having read this letter aloud, the President, without comment,
                              placed in the hands of his guest a bundle of papers. It is only necessary
                              to tell the reader that they were copies of the same documents
                              which Douglas had laid before his father and uncle, each one duly
                              authenticated by the attestation of Lieutenant Whiting.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3000">Mr. Van Buren now threw himself back upon the sofa, and fixed his
                              eye on the face of his companion with an expression which betokened
                              some concern, not unmixed with a slight enjoyment of the perplexity
                              with which the purblind old man pored over the papers. Indeed, his
                              uneasiness could hardly have escaped the observation of a casual spectator.
                              He shifted his seat; he read; then wiped his spectacles, and
                              read again; then wiped his brow; and having gone through all the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3002"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="78"> </a></span>
                              documents, again took them up in order, and read them all over again.
                              When, at length, he had extracted all their substance, he turned on
                              the President a perplexed and anxious look, and remained silent.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3005">At length, the latter spoke. “I fear we have made an unlucky
                              blunder in this business, my dear sir,” said he.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3009">“I fear so too, sir,” said the other. “But I beg leave to assure
                              your Excellency that the information I took the liberty to communicate
                              was a simple and exact statement of what I learned from my son,
                              which, I trust, your Excellency will see is in nowise contravened by
                              these documents. I certainly was not apprised of the provocation
                              which, it is here said, was offered to a lady under Lieutenant Trevor's
                              protection.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3012">“Make yourself perfectly easy on that head, my dear sir,” said the
                              President. “I give myself small concern on Lieutenant Trevor's account.
                              My oblations to his father are more than discharged by the
                              rapid advancement of his elder brother; and he can have no right to
                              complain that proceedings have been instituted to inquire into a matter
                              which, even thus explained, places his loyalty in no very favorable
                              light. My concern is, lest the prosecution of this investigation should
                              lead to results undesirable to you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3015">“I understand your Excellency,” replied the honorable Mr. Baker.
                              “The object of this communication is to convey a covert intimation
                              that, if proceedings against Lieutenant Trevor are not staid, he will
                              revenge himself by endeavoring to dishonor my son. I never brought
                              him up to be the I ‘butcher of a silk button,’ and don't wonder that his
                              notions of gallantry, &amp;c. &amp;c., do not exactly square with those of these

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3021">“That view of the subject is doubtless quite philosophical,” said the
                              President; “and if you regard it in that light, it will remove all
                              difficulty out of the way.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3024">“I cannot exactly say,” replied the other, “that I should be quite
                              willing to expose my son to the pain of seeing these documents made
                              public; concocted, as they manifestly have been, by men who have
                              learned to quarrel by the book, and contrived on purpose to shut the
                              door against enquiry. I dare say he would hardly have made the
                              communication I received, could he have anticipated the step which I
                              deemed it my duty to your Excellency to take in consequence of it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3027">“The misfortune is,” replied the President, “that I have already
                              caused an intimation to be given to Lieutenant Trevor that it may be
                              necessary to order a court martial, unless he thinks proper to demand a
                              court of enquiry. Either way, the whole affair must come out.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3031">“Is there no other alternative?” asked the anxious father. “Could
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3033"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span>
                              not these papers be suppressed? There is no other authentic evidence
                              of the facts.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3036">“Unfortunately,” said the President, to whom habitual intercourse
                              with the base had made the feeling of contempt so familiar that he
                              repressed it without difficulty, “unfortunately these papers are but
                              copies. The originals are doubtless in the hands of Lieutenant Whiting,
                              whose honor cannot be questioned, and probably they would be
                              farther verified by the handwriting of your son.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3039">“What then can be done?” asked the honorable Mr. Baker, in a
                              state of unutterable perplexity
                              <corr id="d2e3041">.</corr> Receiving no answer, he sat musing,
                              with the restless and fidgeting air of a man who seeks in vain for some
                              starting point for his thoughts. He was at length roused from his
                              reverie by two strokes of the bell, which issued from the clock-case at
                              the President's back. The signal was answered by the touch of a
                              hand-bell, which stood on a table near him. The door opened. The
                              gentleman in waiting entered, advanced to the table, laid a packet of
                              letters before the President, and withdrew in silence.

                           <p id="d2e3045">He took them up, shuffled them through his hands as a whist player
                              runs over his cards, and having fixed his eye on one, took it out of
                              the parcel, and threw the rest on the table. His companion having in the
                              mean time relapsed into unconscious reverie, he opened this, and ran
                              his eye over the contents.

                           <p id="d2e3048">“Here is good news for us, my dear sir,” said he. “Lieutenant
                              Trevor here tenders his resignation, which, perhaps, may put an end
                              to the difficulty.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3051">“Perhaps!” exclaimed the other, eagerly. “There can be no doubt
                              about it, I hope.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3055">“None at all; if his accounts are all adjusted, of which I have
                              little doubt. But it is not customary to let go our hold on an officer
                              by accepting his resignation, until that matter has been enquired into.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3058">“It will be a great relief to me,” faltered out Mr. Baker, looking at
                              the President with an anxious and imploring countenance—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3061">“To have this explained at once,” said Mr. Van Buren, interrupting
                              him. “You shall be gratified, my dear sir.”

                              a few words were spoken to him in a low tone, and he again
                              withdrew.

                           <p id="d2e3094">“THERE is something in this business,” said the President, after a
                              silence of a few minutes, “which I do not well understand. I was not
                              prepared to find Lieutenant Trevor so ready to resign, and still less to
                              receive his letter of resignation through the hands of his father, without
                              one word of expostulation to his son, or to me. He does not even
                              intimate any the least regret at the event. What can this mean?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3097">“It does not at all surprise me,” said Mr. Baker. “Hugh Trevor
                              was always a visionary and uncertain man; and his influence over his
                              sons is such, that I should consider the manifest defection of Lieutenant
                              Trevor as a sure proof of the estrangement of the father.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3101">“I thought,” said the President, “that he had been always remarkable
                              for his steadiness and fidelity.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3104">“In one sense he is so,” replied Baker. “But his steadiness is of
                              the wrong sort. He is one of those men who professes to be governed,
                              and, I dare say, is governed by principles. But his principles are so
                              numerous, and so hedge him around and beset him on every side, that
                              they have kept him standing still the greater part of his life. When
                              he moves, it would take an expert mathematician to calculate the result
                              of all the compound forces which act upon him, and to decide certainly
                              what course he might take.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3107">“How happens it, then,” asked the President, “that I have always
                              found him so loyal and faithful in his devotion to me?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3110">“Because he identified your Excellency in his own mind with the
                              Union, to which he determined to sacrifice every thing else. But now
                              that disunion has come, and the question is whether Virginia shall adhere
                              to the North or join the South, he has a new problem to work,
                              and how he may work it, no man can anticipate. Hence I say he is
                              uncertain.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3113">“But does he think nothing of the advancement of his family?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3116">“It seems not, in this instance. That is what I meant when I said
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3118"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="88" data-tei-n="81"> </a></span>
                              that his principles were too many. Your Excellency knows,” continued
                              the honorable gentleman, with a contortion of the mouth meant for
                              a smile, and which, but for the loss of his teeth, might have produced
                              a grin, “that the 
                              <hi id="d2e3120" style="font-style: italic;">cardinal number</hi> of standard principles is the only one
                              which can be counted on.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3125">“Have you then any information,” asked the President, “which
                              leads you to suspect him of disaffection?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3128">“None,” replied Baker; “I do but speak from my knowledge of
                              the man. I do not think him capable of that gratitude for the many
                              favors he and his family have received which should bind him indissolubly
                              to your Excellency's service.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3131">“It is well, at least,” said the President, “that one of his sons, on
                              whom most of those favors have been lavished, is made of different
                              materials. The principles of Colonel Trevor are exactly of the right
                              sort; or, as you would say, my dear sir, they are of just the right
                              number. Could I obtain any information of the father's movements, which
                              might give me just cause to doubt him, I would take occasion to show
                              the difference I make between the faithful and the unstable. I would
                              refuse to receive this young man's resignation, and order a court-martial
                              immediately. I mistake if the father would not be glad to extricate
                              him from the difficulty, by renouncing some of these fantastic notions
                              which he dignifies with the name of principles.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3134">“I beseech your Excellency,” said Baker, forgetting his envious
                              spleen against the virtuous and upright friend of his early youth, in his
                              alarm at the mention of the court-martial, “I beseech your Excellency
                              not to understand me as preferring any charge against Mr. Hugh Trevor.
                              He is an excellent man, who well deserves all the favors he has received,
                              and will, doubtless, merit many more. I pray that what I have
                              said may not at all influence you to any harsh measures against him or
                              his.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3137">The tact of the President at once detected the revulsion of Baker's
                              feelings, and the cause. Indeed, he well knew both the men. He was
                              aware that all that had been said of Mr. Trevor was essentially true.
                              He had, therefore, the more highly prized his friendship, as one of the
                              brightest jewels in his crown. He had taught his advocates and minions
                              to point to him as one, whose support it was known would not be
                              given to any man but from a sense of duty. He was himself not so
                              dead to virtue as not to respect it in another; and his favorable dispositions
                              toward Mr. Trevor, and the benefits bestowed on his family, had
                              more of respect and gratitude than commonly mingled in his feelings
                              or actions. Of Baker, he had rightly formed a different estimate. He
                              found him in the shambles, and had bought and used him. To Baker,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3139"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="82"> </a></span>
                              too, Mr. Trevor appeared only as one, in whose life there was a “daily
                              beauty that made his ugly;” and he had seen, with malignant envy,
                              the honors and emoluments for which he had toiled through all the
                              drudgery of a partisan, freely bestowed on the unasking and unpretending
                              merit of a rival. Gladly would he have improved the distrust,
                              which he saw had entered into the mind of the President, had he not
                              been warned that the first effect of it might be to press an enquiry
                              which must eventuate in the irreparable dishonor of his own son.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3142">While he sat meditating on these things, and subduing his malice to
                              his fears and his interest, the door-bell sounded; the single stroke from
                              the clock-case echoed the sound; the door opened, and a new character
                              appeared on the stage.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3146">No person whose name appears in this history better deserves a particular
                              description than he who now entered. Fortunately, I am saved
                              the necessity of going into it, by having it in power to refer the reader
                              to a most graphic delineation of his exact prototype in person, mind
                              manners, and principles.

                           <p id="d2e3149">In Oliver Dain, or Oliver le Diable, as he was called, the favorite
                              instrument of the crimes of that remorseless tyrant Louis IX., he had
                              found his great exemplar. The picture of that worthy, as drawn by
                              Sir Walter Scott, in Quentin Durward, is the most exact likeness of one
                              man ever taken for another. It is not even worth while to change the
                              costume; for although he did not appear with a barber's apron girded
                              around his waist, and the basin in his hands, it was impossible to look
                              upon him without seeing that his undoubted talents, and the high stations
                              he had filled, still left him fit to be employed in the most abject
                              and menial services.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3152">This happy compound of meanness, malignity, treachery, and talent,
                              was welcomed by the President with a nod and smile at once careless
                              and gracious. At the sight of him, Mr. Baker made haste to rise,
                              and bustled forward to meet and salute him with an air, in which, if
                              there was less of servility, there was more of the eagerness of adulation
                              than he had displayed toward the President himself. The earnest
                              enquiries of Mr. Baker after his health, &amp;c., &amp;c., were answered with
                              the fawning air of one who feels himself much obliged by the notice
                              of a superior, and he then turned to the President as if waiting his
                              commands. These were communicated by putting into his hands the
                              letters of Hugh Trevor and his son, which he was requested to
                              read.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3155">While he read, the President, turning to Mr. Baker, said—“While
                              I thought of ordering a court-martial on the case of Lieutenant Trevor,
                              I deemed it advisable to have all his military transactions looked into,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3157"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="90" data-tei-n="83"> </a></span>
                              intending, if any thing were amiss, to make it the subject of a distinct
                              charge.” Then, turning to the other, he added—“You have, I presume,
                              acquainted yourself with the state of the young man's accounts.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3160">“I have, sir,” was the reply. “They have been all settled punctually.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3163">“Then there is nothing to prevent the acceptance of his resignation?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3167">“Nothing of that sort, certainly, sir. But has your Excellency
                              observed the date of this letter of his? You may see that he does
                              not date from his father's house. I happen to know this place, Truro, to
                              be the residence of that pestilent traitor, his uncle. Now, if the charge
                              be well founded, I submit to your Excellency whether the offender
                              should be permitted to escape prosecution by resigning. If it be not
                              exactly capable of being substantiated, yet his readiness to resign on so
                              slight an intimation renders his disaffection at least probable, and his
                              date renders it nearly certain. Might it not be then advisable to retain
                              the hold we have upon him? The court-martial being once ordered,
                              additional charges might be preferred; and I much mistake the
                              temper of the country where he is, if he does not furnish matter for
                              additional charges before the month of April passes by.”

                           <p id="d2e3170">“Why the month of April?” asked the President.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3173">“Because then the elections come on; and there is little doubt that
                              exertions will be made to obtain a majority in the Legislature of men
                              disposed to secede, and join the Southern Confederacy. In that county,
                              in particular, I am well advised that such exertions will be made.
                              A hen-hearted fellow has been put forward as the candidate of the
                              malcontents, who can be easily driven from the canvass by his personal
                              fears. Let the affair once take that shape, and immediately the fantastic
                              notions of what Southern men call chivalry, which infest the brain
                              of this old drawcansir, will push him forward as a candidate. I had
                              made some arrangements which, with your Excellency's approbation, I
                              had proposed to carry into effect for accomplishing this result, in the
                              hope of bringing him into collision with the law of treason, and so
                              getting rid at once of a dangerous enemy. Now, if this young man's
                              resignation be rejected, and a court-martial be ordered, the part he will
                              act in the affair can hardly fail to be such as to make his a ball-cartridge
                              case.”

                              farther reflection, my good friend Mr. Baker is led by feelings of
                              delicacy to wish to withdraw his charges. I am loth to deny any thing to
                              one who merits so much at my hands, but still there are difficulties in
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3178"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="91" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span>
                              the way which will not permit us to pursue that course. The acceptance
                              of this resignation will effectually remove them, and indirectly
                              gratify the wish of Mr. Baker. Now, what do you advise?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3181">In the act of asking this question, the President shifted his position
                              so suddenly as to call the minion's attention to the motion. He looked
                              up and saw his master's face averted from Mr. Baker, and thought he
                              read there an intimation that he should press his former objection.
                              This he therefore did, expressing his reluctance to give advice unfavorable
                              to the wishes of one so much respected as Mr. Baker, and highly
                              complimenting the delicacy of his scruples.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3184">“But, suppose,” asked the President, “we press the passage of the
                              law authorizing a court to sit here for the trial, by a jury of this
                              District, of offences committed in Virginia. In that case, should our
                              young cock crow too loud, we might find means to cut his comb without
                              a court-martial.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3188">“That Congress will pass such a law cannot be doubted,” said
                              the other, “were it not vain to do so, when it seems to be understood
                              that none of the judges would be willing to execute it. I am tired of
                              hearing of constitutional scruples.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3191">“I am bound to respect them,” replied the President, meekly. “But
                              I really do not see the grounds for them in such a case as this. I beg
                              pardon, Judge Baker. I know it is against rule to ask a judge's opinion
                              out of court. But I beg you to enlighten me so far as to explain
                              to me what are the scruples which the bench are supposed to feel on
                              this subject. I make the enquiry, because I am anxious to accept this
                              young fellow's resignation, if, in doing so, I shall not lose the means of
                              punishing the offences which there is too much reason to think he
                              meditates. To try him in Virginia would be vain. Indeed, I doubt
                              whether your court could sit there in safety.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3194">“I fear it could not,” replied the Judge, “and have therefore no
                              difficulty in saying, that the necessity of the case should overrule all
                              constitutional scruples. I have no delicacy in answering your Excellency's
                              question out of court. It is merely an enquiry, which I hope
                              is superfluous, whether I would do my duty. I trust it is not doubted
                              that I would; and should I be honored with your Excellency's commands
                              in that behalf, I should hold myself bound to execute them.
                              To speak more precisely—should the court be established, and I
                              appointed to preside in it, I should cheerfully do so.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3197">“That then removes all difficulty,” said the President. “The young
                              man's resignation, therefore, will be accepted, and measures must be
                              taken to distribute troops through the disaffected counties in such numbers
                              as may either control the display of the malcontent spirit at the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3199"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="85"> </a></span>
                              polls, or invite it to show itself in such a shape as shall bring it within
                              the scope of your authority, and the compass of a halter.”

                           <p id="d2e3202">Some desultory conversation now arose on various topics, more and
                              more remote from public affairs. On these Mr. Baker would have been
                              glad to descant, and perhaps to hear the thoughts of the President and
                              his minister. But all his attempts to detain them from talking exclusively
                              of lighter matters were effectually baffled by the address of the
                              former. All this was so managed as to wear out the evening, without
                              giving the gentleman the least reason to suspect that he was in the
                              way, or that the great men who had seemed to admit him to their confidence,
                              placed themselves under the least constraint in his presence.
                              At length he took his leave.

                              into a smile, indicative of great satisfaction and self-applause,
                              along with an uncontrollable disposition to merriment. The smile soon
                              became a quiet laugh, which increased in violence, without ever becoming
                              loud, until he lay back against the arm of the sofa, and covered
                              his face with his handkerchief. At length his mirth exhausted itself,
                              and he sat erect, looking at the Minister with the countenance of one
                              about to make some amusing communication. But he waited to be
                              spoken to, and remained silent. His minion took the hint, and addressing
                              himself to what he supposed to be passing in his master's
                              mind, said: “I beseech your Excellency to tell me by what sleight, by
                              what

                              gravity. “Did you not hear the elaborate and lucid argument by
                              which the Judge proved incontestibly that it could not be unconstitutional
                              to do his duty? The wonder is how they ever contrived to make a
                              difficulty. Surely none who shall ever hear that demonstration can
                              doubt again.”

                              to hear that argument. It was a lesson in dialectics worth a
                              course at a German university. But come! There is a time to laugh,
                              and a time to be serious. What do you propose on the subject of these

                              succeed in this, or provoke violence. Either way, we carry our point.
                              We prevail in the elections, or we involve the members elect in a charge
                              of treason. I think we may trust Judge Baker for the rest. The
                              more dangerous of our enemies will thus fall under the edge of the
                              law, and the less efficient, if not left in a minority, will be powerless for
                              want of leaders.”

                           <p id="d2e3268">“But the scene of action,” said the President, “is close to the line.
                              The offenders may escape into North Carolina, and from thence keep
                              up a communication with their friends. The may even venture to
                              Richmond at a critical moment, and effect their great purpose, or they
                              may adjourn to some place of greater security.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3271">“It will certainly be necessary,” said the Minister, “to guard against
                              that, by increasing the number of troops at the seat of government.
                              Besides, if we can but get one day to ourselves, their chance of
                              legislative action may be broken up by adjournment

                           <p id="d2e3280">“Then, with so many points in the game in our favor,” replied the
                              President, “we have but to play it boldly and we must win. It shall
                              go hard, too, if, in the end, we do not make this superfluous State
                              Legislature, this absurd relic of 
                              <foreign id="d2e3282" xml:lang="lat">imperium in imperio</foreign>, abolish itself. At
                              all events, the course of conduct which they will necessarily pursue,
                              must sink the body in public estimation, and dispose the people to
                              acquiesce in the union of all power in the hands of the Central Government.
                              We can then restore them all the benefits of real and efficient
                              local legislation, by erecting these degraded sovereignties into what they
                              ought always to have been—municipal corporations, exercising such
                              powers as we choose to grant.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3287">Some farther conversation ensued, in which details were settled. A
                              minute was made of the points at which troops should be stationed; the
                              number of men to be placed at each; and the corps from which they
                              were to be drawn. It was left to the Minister to fix on proper persons
                              to command each party, and to devise instructions as to the part to be
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3289"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="95" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span>
                              acted. In some places it was proposed simply to awe the elections
                              by the mere presence of the military; in some, to control them
                              by actual or threatened violence; in others, insult was to be used,
                              tumult excited, resistance provoked, and dangerous men drawn in to
                              commit acts which might be denounced as criminal. Having thus possessed
                              himself of his master's will, this modern Sejanus withdrew to
                              give the necessary orders for effecting it.

                           <p id="d2e3292">“The only truly wise man that I know in the world,” said the President,
                              looking after him. “The only one who knows man as he is; who
                              takes no account of human virtue, but as one form of human weakness.
                              In his enemies, it gives him a power over them which he always
                              knows how to use; in his instruments, he desires none of it. Why
                              cannot I profit more by his instruction and example? Fool that I am!
                              I will try to practise a lesson.”

                              the President said: “This young Trevor—he has talent, has he not?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3301">“Talent of every kind,” said the Minister.</p>

                              on the style of that letter. You have your hands too full to be
                              troubled with such things, or I should ask you to do what no man can do
                              so well. But you have your pupils, who have learned of you to say
                              what is to be said, so as just to produce the desired effect, and no
                              other.”

                              President looked after him, and said, musingly: “Were I not myself,
                              I would be that man. I should even owe him a higher compliment
                              could one be devised; for, but for him, I had never been what I am.
                              What then? Is he the creator, and am I his creature? No. I am
                              wrong. Could he have made himself what I am, he would have done
                              so. He has but fulfilled my destiny, and I his. He has made me
                              what I alone was capable of becoming, and I, in turn, have made him
                              all that he ever can be. I owe him nothing therefore; and should he
                              ever be guilty of anything like virtue, there is nothing to hinder me
                              from lopping off any such superfluous excrescence, even if his head
                              should go with it. But he is in no danger on that score. If he held
                              his life by no other tenure, his immortality would be sure.”

                                       his too partial sovereign.

                                       even of meditating such a step, would, at best, be merely nominal;
                                       but at the thought that that one is the son of a friend so long
                                       cherished and so much respected as your father.

                                       to for the purpose of evading military prosecution, is always deemed
                                       little short of a confession of guilt. In most cases, this produces no
                                       embarrassment. The loss of the commission is generally an adequate
                                       punishment; and it is, in such cases, well to leave the conscience and
                                       the fears of the accused to inflict that punishment, ratifying the sentence
                                       by prompt acceptance of the proffered resignation.

                                       that he is not yet prepared how to act in one of so serious a character
                                       as this. His regard for your father is the source of this perplexity.
                                       He requires time to reflect how far he can reconcile to his public duty
                                       that tenderness to the feelings of a friend which makes him desirous,
                                       if possible, to stay enquiry by accepting your resignation. Under
                                       other circumstances, he would not hesitate to reject it, and instantly

                                       as virtually admitted by your attempt to evade a trial; when, if
                                       innocent, you would certainly wish an investigation, in order to establish
                                       your innocence.

                              of his friend Whiting on the back of another, hastily tore it
                              open, and read as follows:

                              than in putting the seal and superscription to the accompanying letter
                              from the Secretary.

                           <p id="d2e3416">“My situation in the Department should have given me earlier notice
                              of what was passing, but I got no hint of it until yesterday. I
                              immediately did what I believed to be my duty as a friend, though I am
                              now fearful that what I did may not meet your entire approbation. I
                              am sensible you would not have done it for yourself; but there are
                              some things which delicacy forbids us to do in our own case, which we
                              are not displeased to have done by others. Indeed, had I known that
                              the matter had gone so far, I should have left it in your own hands.
                              But I had no reason to believe that any intimation of it had, as yet,
                              been given to you, and I wished to prevent any step whatever from
                              being taken.

                              the President. I know that he received and read it. You will therefore
                              judge my surprise at being required to-day to forward the unprecedented
                              document which accompanies this.

                              handwriting is unknown to me, and it was sent to the department precisely
                              in the shape in which you receive it.

                              by the most authentic evidence that it had been read and approved by
                              the President himself.

                                       Impatient as I am of this indignity, I fear I shall be constrained

                           <p id="d2e3470">Mr. Trevor had found leisure, in the meantime, to scrutinize the letters
                              in whole and in detail, and had at length arrived at a conclusion
                              not far from the truth. He was prepared, therefore, to welcome the
                              return of Douglas with a cheerful smile; and instead of adding to his
                              excitement by any expression of resentment or disgust, endeavored to
                              calm and soothe him. For such conduct the young man was altogether
                              unprepared. Aware of his uncle's wishes in regard to him, he had
                              looked for something different, and had endeavored to fortify his mind
                              against such impressions as he feared he might attempt to make on it.
                              The great principles by which he had been taught to govern himself
                              were not false because he had been wronged. His duty to the Union
                              was not affected by the injustice of the President. So his father would
                              have reasoned the matter, and like his father, he determined, if possible,
                              to think and act. But he had no idea that in this attempt he would
                              receive countenance and even aid from his uncle. It may, therefore,
                              be readily believed that the old gentleman rose yet higher in his esteem
                              and confidence, from the delicacy and forbearance which he so
                              unexpectedly practised.

                              and that, until then, nothing of what had passed should he made known
                              to his father, to Delia, or to any of the family but Mrs. Trevor. In
                              her he had learned to seek an adviser, and in her he always found one,
                              sincere, sagacious, and discreet. Mr. Trevor, as I have said, was not a
                              man from whose opinions his wife would probably dissent, but he had
                              not contented himself to command her blind, unreasoning acquiescence.
                              He had trained her mind; he had furnished her with materials for
                              thought; and he had taught her to think. She was in all his confidence,
                              and he consulted with her habitually on plans which involved
                              the welfare of his country. From her, therefore, the history of Douglas's
                              entanglement with the authorities at Washington was not concealed.
                              From the rest of the family it was a profound secret; and, as
                              Mr. Trevor's health was now much restored, it did not interrupt the
                              enjoyments of the genial season which invited them to seek amusement
                              out of doors. By means of this, the impatience of Douglas was
                              diverted, and he found it quite easy to accomplish his philosophical
                              determination to wait the result of the affair in patience.

                              the deferred acceptance of his resignation was received. This, too, was
                              couched in phrases of decorous and studied insult. But he had learned
                              to think that the dastard blow struck by one who screens himself
                              behind the authority of office, inflicts no dishonor. The interval, which
                              had been intended to give his passions time to work themselves into a
                              tempest, had subdued them. Reason had taken the ascendant, and,
                              though his reflections had not been much more favorable to the authority
                              of his former master, than the promptings of his resentment, they
                              were much less suited to his present purpose. He was effectually
                              weaned; divested of all former pre-possessions, and ready to yield
                              to the dictates of calm, unbiassed reason. He sought his uncle, and
                              with a quiet and cheerful smile, handed him the letter.

                           <p id="d2e3503">As soon as Mr. Trevor read it, he exclaimed, “Thank God! you are
                              now a freeman.”

                           <p id="d2e3508">“I am truly thankful for it,” replied Douglas, “though I feel as if
                              I shall never lose the mark of the collar which reminds me that I have
                              been a slave. But, until within a short time past, I have never felt
                              that I was.”

                           <p id="d2e3514">“And was mine enslaved,” asked Douglas, “when my thoughts
                              were as free as air?”
                           </p>

                              splendidly fitted up. But look at the President's letters, and see the
                              penalties you might have incurred, had your freedom of thought rambled
                              into such opinions as many of your best friends entertain.”

                           <p id="d2e3521">“Still,” replied Douglas, “the penalty would have attached, not to
                              the opinion but to the expression of it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3524">“And do you think your mind would work without constraint, in
                              deciding between opinions which it might be unsafe to express, and
                              those which would be regarded as meritorious?”

                              wherein would have been the criminality of 
                              <hi id="d2e3532" style="font-style: italic;">expressing</hi> the opinions

                              the acts of the Government were violations of the constitution, and
                              that the men denounced by Baker as traitors were its most steady
                              supporters. What duty would your oath have prescribed in that case?
                              Would you support the constitution by taking part with those who
                              trampled it under foot, against those who upheld it as long as there
                              was hope?”

                              As such, I am bound to support it. Now, when I have schooled myself

                              conforming to their opinion or my own that I shall satisfy my own conscience,
                              to which my oath binds me, that I do actually support the constitution?”

                              of my own will. I see it, and again respond cordially to your

                              you, my tongue has been tied on the subject of which I think most,
                              and on which I feel most deeply. I find it hard to speak to a son of
                              Virginia without speaking of her wrongs, and the means of redressing
                              them. It is harder still, when he to whom I speak is my own son

                              attributes the oppression to the exercise of powers not granted by the
                              constitution. But, with every disposition to resist this oppression, he
                              taught me to bear it sooner than incur the evils of disunion.”

                              taught to regard as the

                              shall continue to bear these wrongs, or seek the remedy offered by an
                              invitation to join the Southern Confederacy. The evils of which you
                              speak would certainly not be increased by such a step. We might
                              weaken the North, but not ourselves. As to standing armies, here we
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3600"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="97"> </a></span>
                              have one among us. The motive which that danger presented is now
                              reversed in its operation. While we remain as we are, the standing
                              army is fastened upon us. By the proposed change, we shake it off.
                              Then, as to dissention, if there is no cause of war now, there would be
                              none then. Indeed the only cause would be removed, and it would be
                              seen that both parties had every inducement to peace. Even in the
                              present unnatural condition, you see that the separation having once
                              taken place, there remains nothing to quarrel about.”

                           <p id="d2e3603">“What, then,” said Douglas, “is the meaning of all this military
                              array that I see? Are no hostile movements apprehended from the
                              Southern Confederacy?”

                           <p id="d2e3606">“Not at all. They have no such thought. The talk of such things
                              is nothing but a pretext for muzzling Virginia.”

                           <p id="d2e3613">“You will know if you attend the election in this county to-morrow.
                              You will then see that a detachment of troops has been ordered here
                              on the eve of the election. The ostensible use of it, is to aid in the
                              prevention of smuggling, or, in other words, in the enforcement of the
                              odious tariff, and a participation in the advantages our southern neighbors
                              enjoy since they have shaken it off. But you will see this force
                              employed to brow-beat and intimidate the people, and to drive from
                              the polls such as cannot be brought to vote in conformity to the will of
                              our rulers. Go back to Richmond next winter, and you will see the
                              force stationed there increased to what will be called an army of
                              observation. In the midst of this, the Legislature will hold its mock
                              deliberations; and you will find advanced posts so arranged as to bridle
                              the disaffected counties, and prevent the people from marching to the
                              relief of their representatives. By one or the other, or both of these
                              operations, Virginia will be prevented from expressing her will in the
                              only legitimate way, and her sons, who take up arms on her behalf,
                              will be stigmatised as traitors, not only to the United States, but to
                              her.“

                           <p id="d2e3638">As Mr. Trevor had intimated, the next day was the day for the election
                              of members to the State Legislature. The old gentleman, in
                              spite of his infirmities, determined to be present. He ordered his
                              barouche, and provided with arms both the servant who drove him, and
                              one who attended on horseback. He armed himself also with pistols
                              and a dirk, and recommended a like precaution to Douglas. “You
                              must go on horseback,” said he. “It 
                              <hi id="d2e3640" style="font-style: italic;">may</hi> enable you to act with more
                              efficiency on an emergency. At all events, were you to drive me, I
                              should have no excuse for taking one whose services I would not willingly
                              dispense with. Give me the world to choose from, and old Tom's
                              son Jack is the man I would wish to have beside me in the hour of
                              danger. As to you, my son, I think your late master would not be
                              sorry to get you into at scrape. You should, therefore, be on your
                              guard. My infirmities will render your personal aid necessary to help
                              me to the polls. Keep near me, therefore; but keep cool, and leave
                              me to fight my own battles. Prudence and forbearance are necessary
                              for you. As to me, I have nothing to hazard. The measure of my
                              offences is full already. I have sinned the unpardonable sin, and
                              though there is no name for it in the statute book, I have no doubt if
                              they had me before their new Court of High Commission at Washington,
                              your special friend, Judge Baker, would find one.”

                           <p id="d2e3644">“Why do you call him my special friend,” asked Douglas.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3648">“Because I have means of being advised of what is doing among
                              our rulers, and know that he was at the bottom of the whole proceeding
                              against you. Therefore, I warn you to be prudent to-day. Depend
                              upon it, if you can be taken in a fault, he will find means ‘to feed fat
                              his grudge’ against you.”

                           <p id="d2e3651">On reaching the election ground, the stars and stripes were seen
                              floating above the door of the court-house, which was still closed. A
                              military parade was “being enacted” for the amusement of the boys
                              and cake women, and the uniform showed that the men were regulars
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3653"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="99"> </a></span>
                              in the service of the United States. They were twenty or thirty in
                              number, all completely armed and equipped. As soon as Mr. Trevor
                              appeared, they were dismissed from parade, the door was thrown open,
                              and they rushed into the house. Presently after, it was proclaimed
                              that the polls were opened.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3656">As Mr. Trevor approached the door, Douglas observed that a multitude
                              of persons, who before had been looking on, in silent observance
                              of what was passing, advanced to salute him, and, falling behind him,
                              followed to the court-house. On reaching the door, they found it
                              effectually blocked up by half a dozen soldiers, who stood in and about,
                              as if by accident and inadvertence. But the unaccommodating stiffness
                              with which each maintained his position, left no doubt that they
                              were there by design. They were silent, but their brutish countenances
                              spoke their purpose and feelings. Mr. Trevor might have endeavored
                              in vain to force his passage, had not the weight of the crowd
                              behind pressed him through the door. In this process he was exposed
                              to some suffering, but made no complaint. The effect appeared only
                              in the flush of his cheek, and the twitching of his features. The
                              blood of Douglas began to boil, and, for the first time in his life, the
                              uniform he had so long worn was hateful in his sight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3659">On entering the house, they were nearly deafened with the din. It
                              proceeded from quite a small number, but they made amends for their
                              deficiency in this respect, by clamorously shouting their 
                              <hi id="d2e3661" style="font-style: italic;">hurras</hi> for the
                              President, and his favored candidate. Besides the soldiery, there were
                              present the sheriff, who conducted the election, and some twenty or
                              thirty of the lowest rabble. On the bench were two candidates. The
                              countenance of one of those was flushed with insolent triumph. The
                              other looked pale and agitated. He was placed between his competitor
                              and a subaltern officer of the United States army. He seemed to have
                              been saying something, and at the moment when Mr. Trevor and his
                              party entered, was about to withdraw.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3665">Meeting him at the foot of the stair leading down from the bench,
                              that gentleman asked him the meaning of what he saw; to which he
                              answered that he had been compelled to withdraw. The meeting of
                              these two gentlemen had attracted attention, and curiosity to hear what
                              might pass between them, for a moment stilled the many-tongued
                              clamor. Mr. Trevor took advantage of the temporary silence, and said
                              aloud—“You have been 
                              <hi id="d2e3667" style="font-style: italic;">compelled</hi> to withdraw. Speak out distinctly,
                              then, and say that you are no longer a candidate.”

                           <p id="d2e3671">“Fellow-citizens,” responded the other, in the loudest tones his
                              tremor enabled him to command, “I am no longer a candidate.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e3677">“AND I AM A CANDIDATE,” cried Mr. Trevor, in a voice which
                              rang through the house. I am a candidate on behalf Of VIRGINIA,
                              her RIGHTS, and her SOVEREIGNTY.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3680">The shout from behind the bar, at this annunciation, somewhat
                              daunted the blue coats, and Mr. Trevor was lifted to the bench on the
                              shoulders of his friends; when the officer was heard to cry out, “Close
                              the polls.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3683">“Place me near that officer,” said Mr. Trevor, in a quiet tone. The
                              sheriff, a worthy, but timid man, looked at him imploringly. He was
                              set down by the side of the officer, and, leaning on the shoulder of
                              Douglas, thus addressed him:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3686">“I shall say nothing, sir,” said he, “to the sheriff about his duty.
                              He is the judge of that, and he knows that, without my consent, he
                              has no right to close the polls before sunset. Unless compelled by
                              force, he will not do it. He 
                              <hi id="d2e3688" style="font-style: italic;">shall not</hi> be compelled by force; and, if
                              force is used, I shall know whence it comes. Now mark me, sir; I
                              am determined that this election 
                              <hi id="d2e3691" style="font-style: italic;">shall</hi> go on, and that peaceably. If
                              force is used, it must be used first on me. Now, sir, my friends are
                              numerous and brave, and well armed, and I warn you that my fall will
                              be the signal of your doom. Not one of your bayonetted crew would
                              leave this house alive. As to 
                              <hi id="d2e3694" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi>, sir, I keep 
                              <hi id="d2e3697" style="font-style: italic;">my</hi> eye upon 
                              <hi id="d2e3700" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi>. You
                              stir not from my side, till the polls are closed. I hold you as a hostage
                              for the safety of the sheriff. If an attack is made on him, I shall
                              know you for the instigator. And, more than that, sir, I know he is
                              disposed to do his duty, and will not think of closing the polls
                              prematurely. A menace addressed to him may escape my ear. If he offers
                              to do it, if he does but open his mouth to declare that the polls are
                              closed, I blow your brains out on the spot.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3704">Suiting the action to the word, he, at the same moment, showed a
                              pistol, the finish of which gave assurance that it would not miss fire.
                              The officer started back in evident alarm, and made a movement to
                              withdraw; but he found himself hedged in by brawny countrymen,
                              who closed around him, while every hand was seen to gripe the handle
                              of some concealed weapon.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3708">“Be patient, sir,” said Mr. Trevor, “you had no business here; but,
                              being here, you shall remain. No harm shall be done you. I will ensure
                              you against every thing but the consequences of your own violence.
                              Offer none. For if you do but lift your hand, or touch your
                              weapons, or utter one word to your myrmidons, you die.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3711">These words were uttered in a tone in which, though loud enough to
                              be heard by all, there was as much of mildness as of firmness. Indeed
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3713"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="108" data-tei-n="101"> </a></span>
                              his last fearful expression was actually spoken as in kindness. The
                              officer seemed to take it so, and quietly seated himself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3716">Not so the rival candidate. He rose, with a great parade of indignation,
                              saying—“Let 
                              <hi id="d2e3718" style="font-style: italic;">me</hi> pass, at least. This is no place for me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3722">“Do you mean to leave us, sir,” said Mr. Trevor, with great courtesy.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3725">“I do,” said the other. “To what purpose should I remain?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3728">“Do you then decline? Are you no longer a candidate?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3732">“I am—but I will not remain here beset by armed violence.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3735">“Will you leave no one to represent you?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3738">“No—I leave you to work your will. I have no farther part in the
                              matter. I shall do nothing, and consent to nothing. When the law
                              closes the poll, it will be closed.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3741">Saying this, he withdrew, and Mr. Trevor observed that, as he went
                              out, he spoke aside to the sergeant of the company, who followed him
                              from the house. Soon after, the men, one by one, dropped off, and all
                              at length disappeared.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3744">The election now went on peaceably, and nearly every vote was cast
                              for Mr. Trevor. But it did not escape his observation that there were
                              persons present whom he knew to be hostile to him, and devoted to the
                              rulers at Washington, who yet did not vote. He saw the motive of this
                              conduct, but determined to make it manifest to others as well as himself,
                              and to expose the disingenuous and unmanly artifice which he saw
                              his enemies were using against him. Catching the eye of a well
                              dressed man he said, “You have not voted, I think, Mr. A—?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3747">“I have not,” was the answer, “and I don't mean to vote.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3751">“I beg that you will, sir,” said Mr. Trevor. “I know you to be my
                              enemy, personal as well as political; but I sincerely wish the name of
                              every voter in the county to appear on the poll-book, though my defeat
                              should be the consequence.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3754">“It may be so, sir,” replied the other; “but I shall not vote at an
                              election controlled by force, and where those commissioned by the
                              Government to keep order, are either driven off or detained in durance.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3757">“I do not understand you, sir,” said Mr. Trevor. “Am I to infer
                              that the presence of the military here is under the 
                              <hi id="d2e3759" style="font-style: italic;">avowed</hi> orders of
                              their master?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3763">“I dare say,” replied the other, “that Lieutenant Johnson will show
                              you his orders, if you will condescend to look at them.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3766">“I will do so, with great pleasure,” said Mr. Trevor, “and promise
                              myself great edification from the perusal.”
                           </p>

                              pocket, which he read accordingly in the following words:

                              hardly any person remained but the friends of Mr. Trevor, and it was
                              obvious that the result of the election was not to be changed by any
                              votes which could be given. The necessity of keeping open the poll
                              till sunset was, nevertheless, imperious. But the scene became dull
                              and irksome. Douglas, therefore, proposed that his uncle should return
                              home.

                              Should we disband, the sheriff would be required, at the peril of his
                              life, to make a false return. But he shall have his will. Mr. Sheriff,
                              shall I withdraw also?”

                              sheriff; “and either see me home, or take me home with you. I have
                              not the influence which makes you safe in the midst of enemies, and
                              am not ashamed to say that I fear my life.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3806">“I will protect you, then, sir,” said Mr. Trevor, “until you have
                              made out your return, and given your certificate. When these are
                              done, I hope you will be safe.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3809">The scene again subsided into its former dullness. The enemy had
                              disappeared, with the exception of the captive officer, who looked on
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3811"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="110" data-tei-n="103"> </a></span>
                              ruefully, while an occasional vote was given at long intervals. At
                              length, Mr. Trevor observed that some of the voters were about to
                              withdraw. He therefore rose, and begged them to remain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3814">“This business is not over,” said he. “It is not for nothing that
                              the polls are to be kept open until sunset, when all who have not voted
                              have withdrawn. An attack on the sheriff or myself is certainly
                              intended. Perhaps on both. I beseech you, therefore, not to disperse,
                              but to see us both safe to my house. When once among my own people,
                              I will take care of him and myself. I am sorry, sir,” continued
                              he, addressing the officer, “that the movements of your friends make
                              it necessary to detain you longer than I had intended. You must be
                              a hostage for us all, until this day's work is over. But assure yourself
                              of being treated with all courtesy and kindness. Should I even find
                              it necessary to compel your company to my own house, doubt not that you
                              will receive every attention due to an honored guest. I beg you to
                              observe that I do not even disarm you. The warning you have received
                              is my only security that you will attempt no violence.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3817">This speech was heard in sullen silence by him to whom it was addressed.
                              But some conversation with others ensued, in which Mr.
                              Trevor took pains to enlighten the minds of his hearers in regard to
                              public affairs. The day wore away somewhat less wearily; the sun
                              went down, and Bernard Trevor was proclaimed to be duly elected.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3821">Our party now took up the line of march. The sheriff and officer
                              were placed in Mr. Trevor's barouche; the former by his side—the
                              latter in front of him, by the side of the driver. A numerous company
                              on horseback surrounded them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3824">They were scarcely in motion, before the drum was heard, and the
                              regulars were seen advancing to meet them in military array. Mr.
                              Trevor immediately commanded the driver to stop, and draw his pistol.
                              Then calling to the servant on horseback, he made him station himself,
                              pistol in hand, close to the officer. Having made this arrangement,
                              he addressed him:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3827">“You see your situation, sir. Those fellows would not scruple to
                              shoot your master himself at my bidding; and my orders to you both,
                              boys, are, that if we are attacked, you are both to shoot this gentleman
                              upon the spot. I shall do the same thing, sir; so that between us you
                              cannot escape. Now, sir, stand up and show yourself to your men,
                              and speak distinctly the words of command that I shall dictate.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3830">The officer did as he was directed. The advancing platoon was
                              halted, and wheeled-backward to the side of the road; the arms were
                              ordered, and the barouche passed on. After passing, a momentary
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3832"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="111" data-tei-n="104"> </a></span>
                              stop was made, while the sergeant was ordered to march the men back
                              to their quarters. This was done, and as soon as the two parties were
                              at safe distance asunder, Lieutenant Johnson was released, and courteously
                              dismissed. Mr. Trevor and his friends reached home in safety,
                              and without interruption, and thus ended the election day.

                           <p id="d2e3857">THE domestic party that we left at the house of Mr. Trevor were variously
                              affected by the history of the occurrences detailed in the last
                              chapter. Arthur had been slightly indisposed, and his uncle had made
                              that a pretext for keeping him out of harm's way. But when he heard
                              what had passed, his spirit was roused, and he felt as a soldier who
                              hears the history of some well-fought battle where he was not permitted
                              to be present. To Virginia the whole story was a subject of wonderment
                              and alarm. The idea that her dear uncle, and her dearer brother,
                              had been engaged in an affair where “dirk and pistol” was the
                              word, threw her into a flutter of trepidation. She could not refrain
                              from asking the former whether he would have shot the poor man sure
                              enough; and received his affirmative answer with a shudder. The
                              feelings of Lucia did not much differ from hers, except in intensity.
                              She had heard too much to be wholly unprepared for such things, and
                              her mind was too much accustomed to take its tone from those of her
                              mother and sister.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3860">On these ladies the impression made by the events of the day was
                              wholly different. If the countenance of Mrs. Trevor was more thoughtful
                              than before, it only spoke of higher thoughts. Her eye was brighter,
                              her carriage more erect, her step more free, while her smile had
                              less, perhaps, of quiet satisfaction, but more of hope. The flutter of
                              youthful feelings, and the sweeter and more tender thoughts proper to
                              one newly betrothed, made the chief difference between Delia and her
                              mother. But while Douglas saw in the latter all the evidence of those
                              high qualities which fit a woman to be not merely the consolation and
                              joy of her husband, but his sage adviser and useful friend, he saw enough
                              in Delia to show that she, in due time, would be to him all that her mother
                              was to his uncle.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3864">A few days afterwards, Mr. B—arrived, and his appearance was a
                              signal of joy to the whole family. Douglas now, for the first time,
                              discovered that he stood in some interesting, though undefined relation to
                              them, and especially to his aunt. That there was no connexion of blood
                              or marriage he knew; yet the feelings of the parties towards each other
                              were mutually filial and paternal. The imposing dignity of Mrs. Trevor's
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3866"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="113" data-tei-n="106"> </a></span>
                              manner seemed to be surrendered in his presence. Her maiden
                              name of Margaret, which no other lip but that of her husband would
                              have ventured to profane, was that by which alone he ever accosted
                              her, and that generally accompanied with some endearing epithet. The
                              girls would sit upon his knee, and play familiarly and affectionately
                              with his grey locks; while the servants, in the proud humility of their
                              attention to his wants and wishes, seemed hardly to distinguish between
                              him and their beloved and honored master. It was not to be believed
                              that the family kept any secrets from him, so that Douglas could not
                              doubt that he was privy to his little affair of the heart. And so he
                              was; and his manner toward the young man was, from the first, that of
                              a near kinsman, hardly differing in any thing from that of his uncle.
                              As far as coincidence of sentiment and similarity of character could
                              explain this close intimacy, it stood explained. Between him and Mr.
                              Trevor there were many points of strong similitude. But to Mrs. Trevor
                              the resemblance was more striking. Age and sex seemed to make
                              the only difference between them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3869">But, in addition to this domestic relation, which embraced every
                              member of the household down to the scullion and shoe-black, there
                              was obviously some understanding between the gentlemen in regard to
                              matters of much higher concernment. Indeed, no pains were taken to
                              conceal this fact, though, during Mr. B—'s former visit, Douglas had
                              not been admitted to any of their consultations but that which concerned
                              himself.

                           <p id="d2e3872">It was not long before the two were soon closeted, in the little study,
                              in close conclave; and soon after, a message was delivered to Douglas
                              requesting his presence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3875">“I am the bearer of important intelligence,” said B—, holding out
                              his hand to the youth as he entered; “and as it particularly concerns
                              you, as well as your uncle, you must perforce consent to become privy
                              to our council.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3878">“I am not sorry to hear it,” replied Douglas. “If any thing was
                              wanting to banish all reserve between us, I would be content to suffer
                              some loss to effect that object.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3881">“I believe you,” said B—, “and therefore expect you will the less
                              regret an unpleasant circumstance, which, without your act or consent,
                              and even in spite of you, binds you in the same bundle with us.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3885">“That was already done,” said Douglas. “What new tie can there
                              be?”
                           </p>

                              ever incurred the displeasure of the President; was one which no human
                              ingenuity could torture into treason; and certainly my uncle had
                              no hand in that.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3896">“But, having

                              called treason?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3905">“But there has been no such matter.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3909">“My dear boy,” said Mr. Trevor, “the question is not of what we
                              
                              <hi id="d2e3911" style="font-style: italic;">have</hi> done. Had we actually done any thing culpable, there would be
                              no occasion for this warrant from Washington. Our own courts, and a
                              jury of peers, may be trusted to try the guilty. But when men are to
                              be tried for what they have not done, then resort must be had to this
                              new court of high commission at Washington, and to a jury of officeholders.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3915">“But where,” asked Douglas, “is the warrant of which you speak?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3918">“That I cannot exactly say,” said B—. “I am not even sure that
                              it is yet in existence. But that it is, or will be, is certain. I need not
                              explain to you my means of knowledge. Your uncle is acquainted
                              with them, and knows that what I tell you is certain. The transactions
                              of the election day will be made the subject of a capital charge,
                              and it is intended to convey you both to Washington to answer it there.
                              I am come to advise you both of this, that you may determine what
                              course to pursue.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3921">“My course is plain,” said Douglas. “To meet the charge and refute
                              it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3924">“Are you aware,” said B., “who is the Judge of this court of high
                              commission?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3927">“I think I have somehow understood that it is Judge Baker.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3931">“The father of your friend, Phillip Baker, the younger. Now are
                              you aware that, but a few days before the court was constituted, he and
                              other judges were consulted, and declared it to be so grossly unconstitutional
                              that no judge would preside in it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3934">“I see that so it should be declared, but did not know that such
                              opinion had been given.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3937">“Yet so it was. Now where, do you think, the considerations were
                              found by which the honorable gentleman's honorable scruples were
                              overcome? Of course, you cannot conjecture. You 
                              <hi id="d2e3939" style="font-style: italic;">would</hi> find it, 
                              <hi id="d2e3942" style="font-style: italic;">all
                                 too late
                              </hi>, if you, by placing yourself in his power, afforded him an
                              opportunity of gratifying the malice of his son, without exposing his
                              cowardice and meanness. I see you doubt my means of knowledge.
                              Your uncle told me nothing of young Whiting's communication to the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3945"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="115" data-tei-n="108"> </a></span>
                              President. Yet I knew of it. I know,” continued B—, not regarding
                              the amazement of Douglas, “that, but for that letter, you would
                              not have been permitted to resign; and that Judge Baker's scruples
                              about presiding in this new court were overcome by hushing up the
                              enquiry, which would have dishonored his son, and substituting a proceeding
                              which should number you among the victims of his power,
                              without implicating the name of his son. As to my means of knowledge,
                              when knaves get honest men to be the instruments of their
                              villainy, they may expect not to be betrayed. Until then, they must
                              bear the fate of all who work with sharp tools.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3948">“There can be no doubt,” said Mr. Trevor, “of the fate prepared
                              for us, should we fall into the hands of our enemies. To be summoned
                              to trial before a court constituted for the sole purpose of entertaining
                              prosecutions which cannot be sustained elsewhere, is to be notified of a
                              sentence already passed. To obey such a summons, is to give the neck
                              to the halter. The question is, then, what is to be done to evade it.
                              Our friend B—proposes that your brother and sister be sent home, and
                              that you and I, and my family, withdraw to Carolina. How say you?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3951">“I have the same difficulty that I had the other day, about tendering
                              my resignation. But, in this instance, it appears with more force. To
                              fly from justice is always taken as evidence of conscious guilt.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3954">“About that,” said Mr. Trevor, “I feel small concern on my own account,
                              as I certainly 
                              <hi id="d2e3956" style="font-style: italic;">mean</hi> to commit what all who deny the sovereignty
                              of Virginia will call high treason.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3961">“Then why not take up arms at once? I have much misunderstood
                              appearances, since I have been here, if the means not of evading, but
                              resisting this attack, are not already organized.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3964">“The time is not yet ripe for action,”said Mr. Trevor. “Had it
                              been so, I should not have waited until my own head was in jeopardy,
                              before striking the blow. Nor should my own personal danger precipitate
                              it.”

                           <p id="d2e3967">“But what fitter time can there be to call the people to arms, than
                              at this moment, when their minds are heated by the late violent invasion
                              of the elective franchise? What more exciting spectacle could
                              be presented than the sight of a citizen seized as a traitor, and dragged
                              away in chains, to answer, before an unconstitutional tribunal, for
                              maintaining this franchise?”
                           </p>

                              <hi id="d2e3972" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> then prepared to resist, at the point of the bayonet, this
                              unconstitutional warrant, as a thing void and of no authority?”
                           </p>

                              <hi id="d2e3978" style="font-style: italic;">am</hi>,” replied Douglas, with energy. “And I will say more,”
                              said he, speaking with solemn earnestness. “I have seen enough to
                              make my duty plain; and I am prepared to go as far as you, yourself,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e3981"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="116" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span>
                              in asserting and maintaining the sovereignty of Virginia at every hazard.”

                           <p id="d2e3984">“That being the case,” said B—, “as you will not disagree about
                              the end, you must not differ about the means, nor lose time in discussing
                              them. 
                              <hi id="d2e3986" style="font-style: italic;">We</hi> are not thinking of this subject for the first time. We
                              see the whole ground, and act under the influence of considerations
                              which we have no time to detail. Are you then, my young friend, prepared
                              to give us so much of your confidence as this. We say to you,
                              ‘Go with us where we go, and trust our assurance that when we have
                              leisure to explain all, you will find our plan the best.’ Are you
                              content? Are you now ready to carry into execution our matured plan, so
                              far as it has been disclosed to you, trusting all the details to us?
                              Remember—if you say yes to this, we stop no more to deliberate or
                              explain until we are in a place of safety. Until then, you place yourself
                              under orders; and you have learned how to obey. How say you?
                              Are you content?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3991">Douglas paused, reflected a minute or two, and then, extending a
                              hand to Mr. B—, and one to his uncle, said earnestly: “I am;
                              command, and I will obey. But which of you am I to obey?”
                           </p>

                              myself.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e3997">“Then to business,” said B—. “Warn your brother, at once, of the
                              necessity of returning home with your sister, and see that he makes
                              the needful preparations for his departure at an early hour to morrow.
                              The boy's heart will have some hankerings that will make it necessary
                              for you to look after him, and urge him to exertion. You, Trevor,
                              must expedite the arrangements for the removal of your family. Pass
                              the word to Margaret and Delia. You may trust much to their efficiency.
                              I am afraid we cannot expect much more from my poor little
                              Lucia, just now, than from Arthur. Now, Trevor, give me the keys of
                              your arm-room; let Douglas join me there, as soon as he has set Arthur
                              to work, and, in the meantime, send Jack to me there. I will
                              play quartermaster, while you make arrangements for the muster of
                              the black watch.”

                           <p id="d2e4047">POOR ARTHUR! B—had predicted too truly that his heart would
                              have some hankerings at the thought of leaving the house where he
                              had, of late, spent so many pleasant hours. It is so long that I have
                              said nothing about him, that the reader may think him forgotten, or
                              may, himself, have forgotten that there was such a person. He had,
                              in truth, no part in the transactions of which we have been speaking.
                              He was at that time of life when the mind, chameleon like, takes its
                              hue from surrounding objects. He was too young to be advised with,
                              or trusted with important secrets. I have already mentioned that, on
                              the day of the election, he had been detained at home by indisposition.
                              But he had heard of the occurrences of that day; and he was, moreover,
                              unconsciously exposed to influences from every member of the
                              family, all tending to the same point. Least apparent, but not least
                              efficacious, was that of his cousin Lucia. They were of that age when
                              hearts, soft and warm, grow together by mere contact. With thought
                              of love, but without thinking of it, they had become deeply enamored
                              of each other. The thing come about so simply and so naturally, that
                              the result alone needs to be told.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4050">They were to part, and the thought of parting first made them both
                              feel that something was the matter. They talked of the separation,
                              and Lucia shed some tears. Arthur kissed them off, and then she
                              smiled; and then she wept again; and then they agreed never to forget
                              each other; and so on, till the secret was out, and their innocent
                              hearts were fondly plighted.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4054">Such things do not pass unmarked by older eyes. The maternal
                              instinct of Mrs. Trevor, and the sagacity of her husband, had detected
                              that of which the parties themselves were unconscious. And now, in the
                              few hours that they were to remain together, occupied as the old people
                              were with important engagements, neither the glowing cheek, the
                              swimming eye, and the abstracted look of Lucia, nor the rapt enthusiasm
                              of Arthur's countenance, escaped observation. But as no disclosure
                              was made of what had passed, their fancied privacy was not
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4056"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="118" data-tei-n="111"> </a></span>
                              invaded by question or insinuation. They were too young to marry, and
                              secret love is so sweet! Why not let the innocent creatures enjoy the
                              idea that their attachment was not suspected? Their friends smiled
                              indeed, but tenderly, not significantly. To them, they did but seem
                              kinder than ever; and that, at a moment when they were most sensible
                              to kindness, and most ready to reciprocate it. In this heart-searching
                              sympathy, Arthur found himself indissolubly united to the destiny,
                              the opinions, and the feelings, whatever these might be, of those who
                              so loved his dear Lucia.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4059">But I am not writing a love tale. I am but interested that the
                              reader should understand by what process two principal actors in the
                              scenes of which I am about to speak, were diverted from a zealous
                              devotion to the authority of the United States, in which they had been
                              educated, to a devotion yet more enthusiastic in the cause of Virginia.
                              Enough of them has been seen to show that I must be anxious to vindicate
                              them from any charge of inconsistency. I trust the reader
                              enters into this feeling, and deems them worthy of it. If he requires
                              any farther account of the causes which wrought so great a change, I
                              have none to give. It was through their eyes and hearts that conviction
                              entered. Outrage to the laws; outrage to the freedom of election;
                              outrage to one respected and beloved; left nothing for reason to
                              do. Doubtless much had been said to them by their uncle and Mr.
                              B—, in explanation of the great principles of the American Union,
                              which had been trampled on by the Federal Government. But I am
                              not aware that any ideas were presented to their minds on this subject,
                              with which the reading public had not been familiar for twenty years
                              before, and I shall not repeat them here. Let us rather accompany
                              Douglas to Mr. Trevor's magazine of arms. It was in a garret room,
                              where he found Mr. B—busy in the examination of arms, and portioning
                              out ammunition, with the aid of Jack.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4062">“You come in good time,” said B—. “Here is work that you
                              understand. Come help-me to examine these arms, and see that they
                              are all clean, dry, and well flinted.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4065">“What do you propose to do with them?” asked Douglas, lending a
                              hand to the work.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4068">“We propose,” said B—, “to arm the negroes in defence of their
                              master, in case of need.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4071">“But what need can there be, if we set out for Carolina in the
                              morning?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4075">“They may be wanted before morning,” said B—, coolly. “Lieutenant
                              Johnson left the county on the night of the election, and travelled
                              express to Washington. His intelligence was anticipated, and, no

                              doubt, the warrants were all ready before he got there. I dare say
                              they had a ready-made affidavit for him to swear to. This plot was
                              got up so suddenly, that I was hardly advised of it in time. But I
                              hope it is not too late. I have no mind to fire the train too soon. I
                              would rather you should get off peaceably, but, if we do come to blows,
                              I shall take care that the blue-coats have the worst of it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4080">“You move in this business,” said Douglas, “like a man not unused
                              to danger. I presume you have taken the precaution to warn in the
                              hardy and resolute neighbors, whom I saw stand by my uncle the other
                              day.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4083">“By no means,” answered B. “Were we so minded, we could command
                              a force that would demolish any that will be sent against us.
                              But it is not desirable to show the strength of our hand. I should be
                              glad, if possible, that the temper of the people were unsuspected. At
                              the same time, there is an exhibition to be made, which will have a
                              good effect on friend and foe,—I mean an exhibition of the staunch
                              loyalty and heart-felt devotion of the slave to his master. We must
                              show that that which our enemies, and some even of ourselves, consider
                              as our weakness, is, in truth, our strength.”

                           <p id="d2e4086">“Is such your own clear opinion?” asked Douglas. “I have lived
                              so long in the North, that I have imbibed too many of the ideas that
                              prevail there. But, on this point, it appears to me that they must be
                              right.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4089">“You have not lived there long enough,” said B—, “to forget your
                              earliest and strongest attachments. You had a black nurse, I presume.
                              Do you love her?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4092">“My mammy!” exclaimed Douglas; “to be sure I do. I should
                              be the most ungrateful creature on earth, if I did not love one who
                              loves me like a mother.”

                           <p id="d2e4096">“And your foster-brother?” asked B—; “and his brothers and
                              sisters? Do not they, too, love him their mother loves so fondly?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4099">“I have no doubt they do, especially as I have always been kind to
                              them.”

                           <p id="d2e4102">“From these, then, I presume, you would fear nothing. Then
                              your brothers and sisters. They, too, have their mammies and
                              foster-brethren. Among you, you must have a strong hold on the hearts of
                              many of your father's slaves. Would they, think you, taken as a body,
                              rise against your family?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4105">“I have not the least apprehension that they would,” replied
                              Douglas.

                           <p id="d2e4108">“Yet they, thus considered, are one integral part of the great black
                              family, which, in all its branches, is united by similar ligaments to the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4110"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="120" data-tei-n="113"> </a></span>
                              great white family. You have the benefit of the parental feeling of the
                              old who nursed your infancy, and watched your growth. You have
                              the equal friendship of those with whom you ran races, and played at
                              bandy, and wrestled in your boyhood. If sometimes a dry blow passed
                              between you, they love you none the less for that; because, unless you
                              were differently trained from what is common among our boys, you
                              were taught not to claim any privilege, in a fight, over those whom you
                              treated as equals in play. Then you have the grateful and admiring
                              affection of the little urchin whose head you patted when you came
                              home, making him proud by asking his name, and his mammy's name,
                              and his daddy's name. These are the filaments which the heart puts
                              out to lay hold on what it clings to. Great interests, like large
                              branches, are too stiff to twine. Theft are the fibres from which the
                              ties that bind man to man are spun. The finer the staple, the stronger
                              the cord. You will probably see its strength exemplified before
                              morning. There are twenty true hearts which will shed their last drop,
                              before one hair of your uncle's head shall fall.”

                           <p id="d2e4113">“You present the matter in a new light,” said Douglas. “I wish
                              our northern brethren could be made to take the same view of it.”

                              <hi id="d2e4119" style="font-style: italic;">brethren</hi>, as you call them,” said B—, “never can
                              take this view of it. They have not the qualities which would enable
                              them to comprehend the negro character. Their calculating selfishness
                              can never understand his disinterested devotion. Their artificial
                              benevolence is no interpreter of the affections of the unsophisticated
                              heart. They think our friend Jack here to be even such as themselves,
                              and cannot, therefore, conceive that he is not ready to cut his master's
                              throat, if there is any thing to be got by it. They know no more of
                              the feelings of our slaves, than their fathers could comprehend of the
                              loyalty of the gallant cavaliers from whom we spring; and for the same
                              reason. The generous and self-renouncing must ever be a riddle to
                              the selfish. The only instance in which they have ever seemed to
                              understand us, has been in the estimate they have made of our
                              attachment to a Union, the benefits of which have all been theirs, the
                              burthens ours. Reverse the case, and they would have dissolved the
                              partnership thirty years ago. But they have presumed upon the difference
                              between us, and heaped oppression on oppression, until we can
                              bear no more. But, when we throw off the yoke, they will still not
                              understand us. They will impute to us none but selfish motives, and
                              take no note of the scorn and loathing which their base abuse of our
                              better feelings has awakened. Would they but forbear so much as
                              not to force us to hate and despise them, they might still use us as
                              their hewers of wood and drawers of water. But he who gives all
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4122"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span>
                              where he loves, will give nothing where he detests. But this, too, is a
                              riddle to them.”

                           <p id="d2e4128">“Not the ideas, but the application of them. Three months ago,
                              you were the devoted soldier of Martin Van Buren. Had you then
                              believed him capable of a conspiracy so base as that which has been
                              plotted against your honor and life, could you still have served him?”

                           <p id="d2e4131">“I should still have wished to serve my country,” replied Douglas;
                              “but I should, probably, have doubted whether I could have served
                              her in serving him.”

                              been the intended victim, and not yourself?”

                           <p id="d2e4137">“I trust not. My personal concern in the affair, I think, has done
                              no more than to emancipate me from my thraldom. But the display of
                              his character is what makes me detest him; and the scenes of the
                              election day have opened my eyes to the wrongs and the rights, and
                              the interests of Virginia. The scales have now fallen from them, and
                              I am impatient for the day when I may apply in her service the lessons
                              learned in the school of her oppressors.”

                              loaded, and ranged against the wall, and due portions of powder
                              and ball allotted to each firelock. Their work being nearly completed,
                              Douglas was dispatched with some message to his uncle. As
                              he descended the stairs, he heard, not without a smile, the quick impatient
                              step of Arthur, pacing to and fro, the length of a passage leading
                              from the front door through the building. Arthur was just turning
                              at the end next to the door, when a rap on the knocker arrested
                              him. The door was instantly opened, and he was heard to ask some
                              one to walk in. It was night, and the passage was dark. Arthur conducted
                              the stranger to the door of his uncle's study, which was his
                              common reception room, ushered him in, drew back, and having closed
                              the door behind him, resumed his musing promenade.

                           <p id="d2e4176">Douglas went on suspecting nothing. He was not aware that the
                              servants had been cautioned against admitting strangers; and poor
                              Arthur was not

                              His uncle had risen from his chair in the corner farthest from the
                              door, and was standing behind a large table, at which he usually wrote.
                              He heard him say: “Please to be seated, sir,” in a voice between
                              compliment and command, and with a countenance in which courtesy and
                              fierceness were strangely blended. As the stranger, not regarding this
                              stern invitation, continued to advance, the glare of the old man's eye
                              became fearful, and he laid his hand on a pistol which lay on the table
                              before him. “Stand back, sir,” said he, in a low and resolute tone.
                              “Stand back, on your life.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4186">The stranger wore a long surtout, in which Douglas, dazzled by coming
                              into the light, did not at first discover the usual characteristics of
                              an officer's undress. It was thrown open in front, and the badges of
                              his rank were displayed to Mr. Trevor, who stood before him. He was
                              arrested by Mr. Trevor's startling words and gesture, and was beginning
                              to speak, when Douglas exclaimed: “What does this mean?”

                           <p id="d2e4189">The stranger turned, extended both his arms, and Douglas rushed
                              into them.

                              of two young men, who had long been to each other as
                              brothers.

                           <p id="d2e4200">“I come,” said the other, with a melancholy smile, and in the kindest
                              tone, while he still held the hand of Douglas, “to make you
                              prisoner.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4204">Douglas started violently, and tried to disengage his hand; but the
                              other held him firmly and went on; “Be calm, my dear fellow. I am
                              your friend as ever, but yet I do not jest. You are my prisoner, on
                              the absurd charge of high treason against the United States. My warrant
                              is against you and your uncle. As it was thought a military force
                              might be wanted to support the arrest, I volunteered myself to receive
                              a deputation from the marshal, that I might shield you both from any
                              indignity. You, on your part, I am sure, will do nothing to make my
                              task more painful than it is. Is not that gentleman—bless me!
                              where is he? Was not that Mr. Bernard Trevor who just left the
                              room?”
                           </p>

                              again, and saw Mr. Trevor standing where he had been before. He
                              now observed that there was a door beside him, at which he had stepped
                              out and returned. “I am Mr. Bernard Trevor, sir, and am sorry
                              that I cannot welcome, as I would, the friend of my nephew. You see
                              that I have no mind to leave the room, and I therefore hope you will
                              content yourself to accept my invitation to be seated. You say that
                              you wish to shield me from indignity. Of course, you will not
                              unnecessarily offer what I shall feel as much. The 
                              <hi id="d2e4212" style="font-style: italic;">hand</hi> of authority
                              must not be laid on 
                              <hi id="d2e4215" style="font-style: italic;">me</hi>.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4219">“I shall gladly dispense with an unpleasant form, sir,” said Whiting,
                              “and I trust I shall have the satisfaction of convincing you that my
                              errand, though painful to all of us, is an errand of friendship.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4222">“I have no doubt of it, sir. I have heard of you from my nephew,
                              and from under your own hand, in terms that give full assurance of
                              that. I shall be happy, therefore, to do by you all the duties of
                              hospitality. I merely ask of you to give your word of honor, that, while
                              charged with your present functions, you will be careful not to touch
                              my person.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4225">“I should be most happy,” said the young man, “to take by the
                              hand one whom I so highly respect, but I find I must forego that
                              pleasure; and I give the required pledge most cheerfully.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4228">The courteous old gentleman now summoned Tom, and ordered some
                              refreshment for his guest; then throwing into his manner all the frank
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4230"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="124" data-tei-n="117"> </a></span>
                              courtesy of a polished Virginian, he led the way in a desultory
                              conversation on all sorts of indifferent subjects. Half an hour passed in
                              this way, when Tom appeared and summoned the gentlemen to supper.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4234">“I fear” said Whiting, “I am abusing my authority over my poor
                              fellows without. I have a sergeant and half a dozen men waiting at the
                              gate, on whose behalf I would fain invoke your hospitality. But it
                              would be much more agreeable to me, if you and my friend Douglas
                              will pass your words that their aid shall not be necessary, and permit
                              me to order them back to the next public house.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4237">“I am sorry to say,” replied Mr. Trevor, “that I cannot do either;
                              but I pray you to postpone the discussion until after supper.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4240">“How, sir?” exclaimed Whiting. “You surely do not mean to try to
                              escape me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4243">“Nothing is farther from my thoughts, sir,” said the old man, with a
                              proud smile, “than to try to 
                              <hi id="d2e4245" style="font-style: italic;">escape</hi> you, or permit you to escape me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4249">“To 
                              <hi id="d2e4251" style="font-style: italic;">escape you</hi>, sir! What do you mean?” asked Whiting.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4255">“I mean not to wound your ear with a word I would not have
                              endured to have applied to myself. I will not say that you are 
                              <hi id="d2e4257" style="font-style: italic;">my</hi>
                              prisoner; but I will say that 
                              <hi id="d2e4260" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> will leave this house as free as you
                              entered it. Come, my dear sir, while I endeavor to requite your
                              courtesy, permit me also to appropriate your words, and say, as you
                              said to Douglas, that I trust you will not render it necessary to avail
                              ourselves of our superior force.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4265">“I am not sure you posses that superiority,” said Whiting; “I have
                              a strong guard without.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4268">“But they 
                              <hi id="d2e4270" style="font-style: italic;">are</hi> without, and you are within. Besides, you will be
                              readily excused from availing yourself of them, when it is known that
                              they are prisoners, in close custody.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4274">“Prisoners!” exclaimed Whiting. “To whom?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4277">“To my negroes,” said Mr. Trevor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4280">“Regular soldiers prisoners to negroes!” said Whiting, in amazement.
                              “It is not credible; and you manifestly speak by conjecture,
                              as you have had no means of communicating with your friends without.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4283">“I am not in the habit, young gentleman,” said Mr. Trevor, in a
                              tone of grave rebuke, “of speaking positively, when I speak by conjecture.
                              My orders were, that I should not be called to supper until
                              they were secured. As to the strangeness of the affair,” continued he,
                              resuming his cheerful and good-humored smile, “think nothing of
                              that. Remember that night is what the negroes call ‘their time of
                              day.’ The eagle is no match for the owl in the dark. The thing is as
                              I tell you; so make yourself easy, and let me have the pleasure of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4285"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="125" data-tei-n="118"> </a></span>
                              doing the duties of hospitality by my nephew's friend. You shall not
                              be unnecessarily detained. We must ask the pleasure of your company
                              for a three hours' ride across the line in the morning. I will there
                              give you a clear acquittance against all the responsibility you may have
                              incurred, for what you have done, or left undone; and, as soon as you
                              return, to restrain your men from acts of license, they shall be given
                              up to you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4289">There was no remonstrating against this arrangement; and Lieutenant
                              Whiting, putting the best face he could on the matter, permitted
                              himself to be conducted to supper.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4292">At the head of the supper table stood, as usual, Mrs. Trevor. She
                              seemed some six inches higher than common, her cheek flushed, her
                              nostrils spread, her eye beaming; yet with all her high feelings
                              subdued to the duties of hospitality and courtesy. She met and returned
                              the salutation of Whiting with the stately grace of a high-bred lady,
                              and then her eye glanced to her husband with a look of irrepressible
                              pride. His glance answered it, and, as they stood for a moment facing
                              each other at the opposite ends of the table, Whiting felt a sense of
                              admiring awe, such as the presence of majesty in full court had never
                              inspired. But this feeling, in a moment, passed away, with its cause.
                              The urbanity of the gentleman and the suavity of the lady soon removed
                              all the painfulness of constraint, and the evening passed as it
                              should pass between persons who in heart were friends.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4295">Neither Mr. B—nor Arthur made their appearance. The girls,
                              indeed, were present. The air and manner of Delia reflected those of
                              her mother. Virginia looked a little alarmed, and Lucia blushing,
                              tender, and abstracted. The interest of the realities that surrounded
                              her could not quite dispel the visions of excited fancy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4298">With these exceptions, which a stranger would not observe, every
                              thing passed as in the company of an invited and cherished guest, and
                              Whiting could not be sorry, at heart, that he had been baffled in his
                              attempt to disturb so sweet a domestic party. The evening wore away
                              not unpleasantly, and he retired to rest in the same room with Douglas,
                              to guard him, or be guarded by him, according as it suited his fancy
                              to consider himself or his friend as the other's prisoner.

                           <p id="d2e4327">THE first words which passed between Mr. Trevor and Lieutenant
                              Whiting, had been overheard by Tom, who was in the act of leaving
                              the room at the moment. He gave the alarm to his mistress, who,
                              hastening to her husband, met him at the door, and just received from
                              him the instructions already mentioned. She immediately sent for Mr.
                              B—, who, with Jack's aid, was in the act of distributing arms and
                              ammunition to the negroes. To him the management of the whole
                              affair was committed. No doubt was entertained that Lieutenant Whiting
                              had not come unattended. The first thing to be done was to ascertain
                              the force by which he was supported, and the place where he had
                              posted his men.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4330">They, meantime, quietly awaited the return of their officer at the
                              great gate, a quarter of a mile from the house. Rather as a point of
                              military etiquette than from an idea that any precaution was necessary,
                              they had stacked their arms in form before the gate, and stationed a
                              sentinel, who, with head erect and military step, walked his post in
                              front of them. They had not long been there, before they heard a
                              negro's voice, who, as he approached from the house, sung merrily a
                              song, of which only the following lines could be distinguished:

                              quite near, he was arrested by the sharp challenge of the sentry.

                              men. “Damn the old hunks, I hope he don't mean to leave us to
                              bivouack here all night. Well, we must wait our hour, as the Lieutenant
                              told us, and then he'll come back to us, or we have to march to
                              the house. Damn it! I shall be pretty sharp set by that time, and, if
                              it comes to that, the old gentleman's kitchen and wine-cellar may look

                           <p id="d2e4467">The negro disappeared, and the soldiers occupied themselves in discussing
                              the means of making a profitable speculation on their disposition
                              to leave their master. They were still on this topic when they
                              heard Jack returning, with several more. One brought a chunk of
                              fire; another a basket of apples; another one of eggs; a fourth came
                              provided with some cold provisions; Jack himself brandished a couple
                              of bottles of brandy; and one of his boys brought a pint of water
                              and a tin cup. The liquor was tasted, approved, paid for, and eagerly
                              swallowed. A torch of light-wood being kindled, a chaffering commenced,
                              interrupted by occasional allusions to the interesting subjects
                              of slavery, hard masters, and emancipation. The brandy, however,
                              chiefly engaged the attention of the soldiers. The sentry, whose duty
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4469"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="129" data-tei-n="122"> </a></span>
                              was but formal, was permitted to join, as the guns were but a few feet
                              off, just without the gate, which stood open. The light of the torch
                              glittered strongly on the arms, and seemed to make all things distinct,
                              while in fact its unsteady flickering did little more than dazzle their
                              eyes. The negro held it aloft, and, as if to brighten the flame,
                              occasionally waved it to and fro. Suddenly it dropped from his hand into
                              the pail of water, and in an instant the blackness of impenetrable
                              darkness shrouded every eye.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4472">At the same moment, a heavy trampling, as from a rush of many
                              feet, was heard without the gate, and a shivering clash from the stack
                              of arms, as if it had fallen down. The soldiers groped their way towards
                              it feeling where they supposed it to be. They felt in vain. They
                              winked hard, as if to free their eyes from the blinding impression left
                              by the flaring light, then opened them and looked about. Judge their
                              astonishment, when, as they begun to recover their sight, they found
                              themselves surrounded by a dusky ring, from which issued a voice, not
                              unlike that of their friend Jack, which informed them, in good English,
                              that they were prisoners. The prick of a bayonet on one or two who
                              endeavored to pass through the circle, convinced them that such was the
                              fact; and, after a short parley, they permitted themselves to be marched
                              off, and safely stowed away in a strong out-house.

                           <p id="d2e4475">I would not have the reader give the negroes the credit of this
                              stratagem. It had been devised by B—, who knew that he could depend
                              on the address and quick wit of Jack for drawing the soldiers
                              into the snare. All that part of the business had been left to his own
                              discretion. As soon as he had secured the amicable reception of himself
                              and a few others, the rest, dividing into two parties, left the house,
                              and, crossing the fence at some distance from the gate, and on each
                              side of it, advanced stealthily toward it. Here they met, and having
                              arranged themselves for a sudden rush on the stack of arms, an agreed
                              signal was given by a negro who possessed a faculty of mimicking the
                              voices of all animals. As soon as the light was extinguished, the necessary
                              number rushed forward to the object on which their eyes had been
                              fixed; seized the arms, and, falling back, ranged themselves in a half
                              circle outside of the gate. Those who had been with the soldiers, and
                              who all wore concealed arms, closed in behind them, and, completely
                              hemmed them in. B—, in the mean time, who had his reasons for not
                              wishing to be seen, kept aloof; and, as soon as he knew that the soldiers
                              were secured, returned to the house. There, too, he took care
                              not to show himself; and Arthur was advised that he should not, by
                              making his appearance, at all involve himself in what had been done.

                           <p id="d2e4507">AT daylight all was in motion. Arthur and Virginia, being affectionately
                              dismissed by their friends, were first upon the road, before
                              Lieutenant Whiting was awake. Much of the night had been spent
                              in preparations, and long before sunrise Douglas handed his aunt and
                              cousins into their carriage. His uncle mounted the barouche, with
                              Jack for driver, by whose side old Tom was placed; while the lady's
                              maid took her seat by her single-minded master with a freedom from
                              which an amalgamationist would have drawn the most pleasing inferences.
                              No other white person was seen; but a body-guard of twenty
                              negroes, well armed, and mounted on plough horses, some saddled,
                              some cushioned, and some bare-backed, surrounded the carriages and
                              baggage-wagon. In the midst rode Douglas and his friend on horseback.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4510">“You see,” said Mr. Trevor to Whiting, as he took his place in the
                              barouche, “that the part these faithful creatures took in last night's
                              work, drives them into exile as well as me. I must not leave them
                              behind to be the victims of baffled malice. What is to become of my
                              plantation, is a question of less importance. I suppose I may say with
                              Cincinnatus, when honor was forced on him as it is on me, my fields
                              must go untilled this year! You see here, sir, my whole male force.
                              Not one proved recreant.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4514">“This affair is altogether unaccountable to me,” said Whiting to
                              Douglas, as they moved off together; “and this the strangest feature
                              of the whole. Do men, then, act without motives, and against all
                              assignable motives?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4517">“I asked the same question myself last night,” said Douglas, “and
                              was referred to coming events for the answer. I was partly taught, at
                              the same time, to account for what I was told to expect.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4520">“And how can it be accounted for?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4523">“I cannot say I have my lesson perfect; but something was said
                              about the difference of character produced by peculiar training, and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4525"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span>
                              habitudes of mind formed by circumstances. For my part, it appears
                              to me that there must be something, by nature, in the moral constitution
                              of the negro, intrinsically different from the white man.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4528">“It would, indeed, seem so,” said Whiting, “if we are to credit
                              what we see; but, in that case, we must reject the authority which
                              tells us that all are of one race.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4531">“So are all dogs,” said Douglas; “and dogs can no more act without
                              motive than man. It depends on temper and character what shall
                              be the motives of action. The wolf would be sadly puzzled to judge of
                              the motives of the Newfoundland dog. May not circumstances, which
                              have made the difference between them, have produced the much less
                              difference between the white man and the negro? I have no measure
                              for the effect of such causes. If I am put to choose between rejecting
                              the evidence of my own senses, or the evidence of God's word, or the
                              philosophy which teaches that man is to be considered as a unit, because
                              all of one race, philosophy must go by the board. It may be,
                              that what is best for me, is best for my friend Jack there, and

                              </hi>; but as long as neither of us thinks so, why not leave each to
                              his choice? Besides, there is more room in the world for both of us,
                              than if both always wanted the same things.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4538">A ride of a few hours carried the party across the line into North
                              Carolina. Here they stopped at the first public house; and Mr. Trevor
                              drew up a hasty statement of the events of the night, which 
                              <hi id="d2e4540" style="font-style: italic;">should</hi>
                              have the effect of acquitting Lieutenant Whiting of all blame, on
                              account of his own escape from the fangs of his enemies. In this he set
                              forth that, having been warned of the intended prosecution, he had
                              made his preparations accordingly, and that the officer had but fallen
                              into a snare from which no vigilance could have saved him. This he
                              signed, and gave moreover, a clear acquittance to Lieutenant Whiting
                              for all he had done; and having thus placed him, as far as depended
                              on himself,

                              liberty to go whither he would.

                              touch degrading is broken by the State line, let me have the pleasure
                              of taking you by the hand, not only as my nephew's friend, but as one
                              who, in the extremes of victory and defeat, as captor and as prisoner,
                              has borne himself as became a gentleman.”

                              latter walking and leading his horse. They conversed of the past and

                           <p id="d2e4561">“I have been a volunteer in this business,” said Whiting. “I shall
                              not disguise that my friendship for you led me to offer my services, and
                              I fear that no excuse will be received for my failure. There is a spirit
                              somewhere at work, to which I will give no name, that will be implacable
                              at the thought that any advantage may have been lost by my respect
                              for your feelings.”

                           <p id="d2e4565">“I am afraid it may prove so,” replied Douglas. “The consequence
                              may be fatal to your advancement in the army, and perhaps you may
                              be driven from it, as I have been. Should it be so, my dear Whiting—
                              but I will not profit so little by the example of delicacy set me while I
                              wore the epaulette, as to say anything to you now. I would content
                              myself with telling you where I shall be found, if I myself knew. But
                              shall I keep you advised of my movements?”

                           <p id="d2e4568">“By all means,” said Whiting. “I shall always wish to know your

                              lead you to share my fate?”

                           <p id="d2e4584">A farther ride of a few miles brought our party to the village in
                              which Mr. Trevor wished to take up his temporary residence. Here
                              they found Mr. B—, who had been engaged in investigating the comforts
                              and capabilities of the different public houses, and having fixed
                              on that he liked best, met Mr. Trevor in the street, and conducted the
                              party to it. The two friends soon drew apart to discuss with the landlord
                              the necessary arrangements for the comfort of the family during
                              their proposed stay.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4587">While they were thus engaged, Douglas seated himself, after the
                              manner of the country, in the bar-room, in which, besides some
                              travellers, there was a motley assemblage of the inhabitants of the village,
                              who had come in to stare at and talk about the new comers. By
                              the time Douglas had taken care of the ladies and baggage, they
                              were deep into the merits of the whole party; and, when he entered
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4589"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="133" data-tei-n="126"> </a></span>
                              the room, they were too busy talking to pay any attention to him. The
                              principal interlocutors were three. First, a well-dressed, middle-aged
                              man, whose dapper air and delicate hands bespoke one accustomed to
                              bowing across a counter over lace patterns and painted muslins; and
                              whose style of eloquence was exactly adapted to the praise of such
                              articles. Then there was a coarse, strong man, with a bacon-fed look,
                              plainly, cheaply, and untastefully dressed in clothes which, by their
                              substantial goodness, indicated at once the wearer's prudence and the
                              length of his purse. His voice was loud, strong, and self-important,
                              entirely devoid of melody, and incapable of inflection or modulation.
                              His whole appearance showed him to be a substantial planter, ignorant
                              of everything but corn and tobacco. A huge whip in the hand of the
                              third, together with his dusty and travel-soiled appearance, denoted the
                              driver of a wagon which stood before the door.

                           <p id="d2e4618">“I CANNOT say I like it altogether, Squire,” said the planter. “It may
                              suit my neighbor Jones, here, well enough to have one of them
                              high-headed Roanoke planters to come here with his family and spend
                              his money. I dare say he will make a pretty good spec out of them;
                              but, for my part, I would rather they would stay at home and live under
                              their own laws. I ha'nt got no notion, after they saddled that
                              damned rascal Van Buren upon us so long, that now, the minute we
                              have shook him off and made a good government, and good treaties,
                              and all, they should be wanting to have a sop in our pan. If that's
                              what they are after, in rebelling against their government, I don't
                              want to give them no countenance. What we have done, we have
                              done for ourselves, and we have a right to all the good of it. They
                              have fixed their market to their liking, and let it stand so. If we can
                              get thirty dollars for our tobacco, and they cannot get ten, I reckon we
                              ha'nt got nobody to thank for it but ourselves. I dare say, now they
                              see how the thing works, they would be glad enough to share with us,
                              but I see plain enough that all they would get by joining us we would
                              lose, and may be more too.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4621">“You are right there, Mr. Hobson,” said the merchant; “and that
                              is not all. There's an advantage in buying as well as selling. Now,
                              as to this Mr. Trevor, or whatever his name is, coming over here, and
                              buying things cheaper than he could get them at home—why, that he is
                              welcome to. Though you may be sure, neighbor, I don't let him have
                              them as cheap as I sell to you. But as to letting in the Norfolk merchants
                              to all the advantage of our treaty with England, that is another
                              matter; for though, when we deepen the bar at Ocracock, I have no
                              doubt our town down there will be another sort of a place to what Norfolk
                              ever was, yet if Virginia was to join us now, right away, the most
                              of the trade would go to Norfolk again, and they would get their goods
                              there as cheap as we get them here and may be a little cheaper. So
                              you see it is against my interest as well as yours; and I don't like the
                              thoughts of putting in a crop, and letting another man gather it, any
                              more than you do.”

                              wagoning before. Instead of just hauling the little tobacco that is

                           <p id="d2e4642">It is hard to say whether surprise or disgust most prevailed in the
                              mind of Douglas at hearing these remarks. The idea of the advantages
                              lost to Virginia, by her connexion with the North, had never entered
                              his mind; but still less had he conceived it possible that a sordid desire
                              to monopolize these advantages could stifle, in the minds of the
                              North Carolineans, every feeling of sympathy with the oppressed and
                              persecuted assertors of the rights of Virginia. The reply of Mr. Hobson
                              to the remark of the wagoner gave him a yet deeper insight into
                              that dark and foul corner of the human heart where self predominates
                              over all the better affections.

                           <p id="d2e4645">“I don't think that's right fair in you, wagoner,” said he. “You
                              haul the Virginia tobacco down to Commerce, and when it gets there it
                              is all the same as mine. Now, if it was not for that, I am not so
                              mighty sure but I'd get forty dollars instead of thirty, and I don't like
                              to lose ten dollars to give you a chance to get one.”

                           <p id="d2e4648">“It is all one to me,” said the wagoner. “You may just pay me
                              the same for not hauling that they pay me for hauling, or only half as
                              much, and I will not haul another hogshead.”

                           <p id="d2e4655">“Like enough,” replied the wagoner, “for all trades must live; and
                              if them poor devils got a chance to sell a hogshead or two, instead of
                              leaving it all to rot, you ought not to grudge them that.”

                           <p id="d2e4658">“Certainly not,” said the merchant, “for I guess that whatever they
                              get, they take care to lay it all out in goods on this side of the line; so
                              the money stays with us after all, and friend Stubbs's hauling does good
                              to more besides him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4661">“I see” said Hobson, “how it does good to you, but none to me.”</p>

                              entered while this conversation was going on. “Them hot-headed fellows

                              themselves into hot water every now and then; and when they run
                              away and come to us, if they did not bring no money, we'd have to
                              feed them free gratis for nothing. Now Stubbs hauls Squire Trevor's
                              tobacco to Commerce, and he gets a good price; and then he gets into
                              trouble, and comes over here to stay with me, and so he is able to pay
                              me a good price;” and here it is,” added he, showing a roll of notes.

                           <p id="d2e4679">“No, I would not. I would not let them come; or, if they did, just
                              give them up to their own government. If they had not a chance to
                              be running over here, as soon as they got into trouble, they would keep
                              quiet, and never get a chance to separate, and so ruin our business,
                              whether they joined us or no.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4682">“Old Rip is wide awake at last,” said a voice from behind; “but it
                              is to his interest only.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4685">Douglas turned to the voice of the speaker, the tone of which expressed
                              a scorn and derision most acceptable to his feelings. He was
                              a tall and fine looking man, powerfully made, and inclined to be fat,
                              but not at all unwieldy. The half laughing expression of his large,
                              blue eyes, and the protrusion of his under lip, spoke his careless
                              contempt of those whose conversation had called forth his sarcasm. The
                              attention of the whole company was drawn to him at the same moment,
                              all looking as if they wished to say something, without knowing what.
                              At length the wagoner spoke, on the well understood principle that,
                              when men talk of what they understand imperfectly, he who knows
                              least should be always first to show his ignorance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4688">“I cannot say I understand rightly what you mean, stranger,” said
                              he; “but I guess, by the cut of your jib, that you are one of them
                              high dons from South Carolina, that always have money to throw away,
                              and think a body ought never to care any more for himself than another.
                              But this business don't consarn you, no how, because these people
                              don't interfere with your cotton crop.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4691">“Yes, but they do, though,” said Hobson; “for if they drive me
                              from tobacco, I shall make cotton. But if I can keep them out of the
                              tobacco market, I shall be willing to give up the making of cotton to
                              South Carolina.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4695">“Why, that is true,” said the stranger, with a sudden change of
                              his countenance, from which he discharged, in a moment, every appearance
                              of intelligence, but that which seemed to reflect the superior wisdom
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e4697"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="130"> </a></span>
                              of Mr. Hobson. “That is true,” said he, looking as if making a
                              stupid attempt to think; “I had not thought of that before.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4700">As he said this, he sunk slowly and thoughtfully into a chair, his
                              knees falling far asunder, his arms dropping across his thighs, his body
                              bent forward, and his face turned up toward Mr. Hobson, with the look
                              of one who desires and expects to receive important information. The
                              whole action spoke so eloquently to Mr. Hobson's self-esteem, that he
                              went on, with an air of the most gracious complacency.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4703">“You see, stranger, just shutting only a part of the Virginia tobacco
                              out of the market, makes a difference of ten dollars, at the very least,
                              in the price of mine. Now, we used to make a heap of cotton in this
                              country, but we are all going to give it up quite entirely, and then, you
                              see, it stands to reason it will make a difference of five cents a pound,
                              or may be ten, in your cotton.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4706">This interesting proposition was received by the stranger with a
                              sluggish start of dull surprise, from which he sunk again into the same
                              appearance of stolid musing. “To think what a fool I have been,”
                              said he after a long pause. Then, scratching his head, and twisting in
                              his chair, he added: “You are right, you are right; and the only way
                              to manage the matter is to get your Legislature to pass a law, as you
                              say, to make those fellows stay at home.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4709">“To be sure it would”, said the gratified Hobson; “but then there
                              are so many conceited fellows in the Legislature, with a fool's notion in
                              their heads about taking sides with them that cannot help themselves,
                              that there is no getting anything done.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4712">“Well,” said the stranger, “this gentleman guessed right when he
                              said I was from South Carolina. So I don't know anything about your
                              laws here. But I suppose you have no law to hurt a man for taking up
                              one that runs away from the law in Virginia, and carrying him back.
                              I expect old Van would pay well for them.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4716">Hobson looked hard at the stranger, and only answered with that
                              compound motion of the head, which, partaking at once of a shake and
                              a nod, expressed both assent and caution.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4719">The landlord and merchant both exclaimed against this suggestion, the
                              one illustrating his argument by the freedom with which his guest had
                              ordered wine from the bar; the other, by his former experience of his
                              liberality as a purchaser of goods while he kept store in Mr. Trevor's
                              neighborhood, which he had withdrawn since the revolution. Among
                              the bystanders there was no expression of opinion, but that sort of
                              silence which betokens an idea that what has been said is well worth
                              considering.

                              stranger's voice, placed himself at the back of his chair, looking on
                              with a playful smile. He now spoke—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4748">“Have you played out the play?” said he.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4752">The stranger sprung to his feet in a moment, and, facing B—, caught
                              him by the hand, which he shook with an energy which seemed to
                              threaten dislocation. The two then turned off, and left the room together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4755">“This is most fortunate, my dear sir,” said the stranger; “but pray
                              tell me how happens it that I find you here?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4758">“Do you not perceive,” said B—, “that I have a friend in trouble,
                              and that I am here with him? Did you not hear the name of Trevor
                              just now?”

                              Bernard? Is he here? In trouble? About what? I came this far
                              to see you both, and not choosing to go into Virginia, was listening to
                              the conversation of those fellows, in hopes to find some one among
                              them whom I could trust to send with a request that you would both

                              for a while. He has been elected to the Legislature, and they have
                              gotten up a prosecution against him before that iniquitous court of high
                              commission at Washington, to hang him, if they can, or at least to
                              drive him off.”

                              The best of the three is a Yankee tin-pedler, turned merchant. The
                              other two are the worst specimens of their respective species. I dare
                              say there are many more like them, but there are fifty gentlemen of
                              property in this county who would stand by us; and are ready, in their
                              individual capacity, to aid us with purse and sword, whenever we raise

                              on your account. You must understand that he was an officer in
                              the army of the United States, and incurred the mortal displeasure of
                              his master for not joining one of his millions in abuse of you, when
                              the news of your successful negotiation with the British Government
                              was received.”

                           <p id="d2e4785">Douglas was now called into the room, and introduced to the stranger,
                              and the three gentlemen repaired together to the parlor of Mr. Trevor.
                              A cordial greeting between the two friends, and a sprightly conversation
                              on various topics, ensued; but at length the ladies left the room,
                              and affairs of moment came under discussion.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4788">“I am come,” said the stranger, “to learn your plans, and to consult
                              of the best means of affording such aid as we can. When, where, and
                              how, do you mean to move?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4792">“We have carried the elections,” said B—, “so as to be sure of a
                              majority in the Legislature, if they can be freed from the presence of
                              the Federal army. But, unless that can be done, our friends here, and
                              many others, will not be permitted to attend, and the weaker brethren
                              will be overawed.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4795">“Of course, then, you will attempt that. What measures do you
                              propose to take?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4798">“None that shall attract observation,” said B—. “It is impossible,
                              at this time, to draw together any force which might not at once be
                              overwhelmed by the army at Richmond. We are, therefore, obliged
                              to lie quiet, and suffer our people to see for themselves the advantages
                              they are losing. They are beginning to understand this. They perceive
                              that your commercial arrangements are making their neighbors
                              in this State rich, while they can sell nothing that they make, and are
                              obliged to give double price for all they buy. The abatement of duty
                              in the English ports on your tobacco, and the corresponding abatement
                              of your impost on British manufactures, is driving trade, money, and
                              even population, to the South; and nothing but separation from the
                              Northern States can prevent our whole tobacco country from being deserted.
                              This, of course, will open the eyes of the people in time, and
                              we hope, that when the Legislature meets, it may be practicable to
                              draw together, on the sudden, such a force as may drive the enemy
                              from Richmond, and give time at least to adjourn to a place where
                              they may deliberate in safety.

                              be provided for the emergency, should it arise.”

                           <p id="d2e4813">“There is a section of the State,” replied B—, “where circumstances
                              enable me to exert a powerful influence, and where, from its localities,
                              a partisan corps might maintain itself, in spite of the enemy, and might
                              give so decided a disposition to the surrounding population, as to
                              establish perfect security within a pretty extensive district.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4816">“But is there no danger,” said the southron “that such a corps
                              would induce an increase of the force at Richmond and elsewhere, and
                              so make the first step in your enterprise more difficult?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4819">“It would have that effect,” said B—, “were not the scene of action
                              remote from Richmond, and unless the operations of the corps were so
                              conducted as to create no alarm for that place. Of course, there should
                              be no appearance of concert with this lower country; and, so far from
                              increasing apprehension of our ulterior designs, our failure to rally
                              to the banner of a successful leader might disarm suspicion.”

                           <p id="d2e4825">“We have such a one,” said B—, “and it is well that you are here
                              with us to aid in consecrating him to the task. Here he stands.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4829">As he said this, he laid his hand, solemnly, gently, and respectfully,

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4835">“Courage, talent, address, and military education,” said B—, with a
                              quiet smile.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4838">“And where should I find men willing to be commanded by me, in
                              an enterprise which, of course, supposes the absence of all legal

                              to be provided?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4844">“I should still be bound to enquire,” said Douglas, “what good
                              end is proposed, before I could agree to enter on a course of conduct
                              which nothing but the most important considerations could justify.”

                              clearly. You would have understood it long before this, but that as
                              long as one shred remained of the tie that bound you to the army of
                              the United States, a delicate respect to you imposed silence on your

                              reason why Virginia should detach herself from the Northern Confederacy,
                              and either form a separate State, which we do not propose, or
                              unite herself to the South, which we do. Is not that your difficulty?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4853">“It is,” replied Douglas. “I have long been sensible that there
                              were views of the subject which my situation had hidden from me, and
                              have frequently lamented (while I was grateful for) the resolute
                              reserve which my friends have maintained.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4856">“You must be sensible”, said B—, “that the Southern States, including
                              Virginia, are properly and almost exclusively agricultural.
                              The quality of their soil and climate, and the peculiar character of
                              their laboring population, concur to make agriculture the most profitable
                              employment among them. Apart from the influence of artificial
                              causes, it is not certain that any labor can be judiciously taken from
                              the soil to be applied to any other object whatever. When Lord
                              Chatham said that America ought not to manufacture a hob-nail for
                              herself, he spoke as a true and judicious friend of the colonies. The
                              labor necessary to make the hob-nail, if applied to the cultivation of
                              the earth, might produce that for which the British manufacturer
                              would gladly give two hob-nails. By coming between the manufacturer
                              and the farmer, and interrupting this interchange by perverse legislation,
                              the Government broke the tie which bound the colonies to the
                              mother country.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4859">“When that tie was severed and peace established, it was the interest
                              of both parties that this interchange should be restored, and put
                              upon such a footing as to enable each, reciprocally, to obtain for the
                              products of his own labor as much as possible of the products of the
                              labor of the other.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4862">“Why was not this done? Because laws are not made for the benefit
                              of the people, but for that of their rulers. The monopolizing spirit
                              of the landed aristocracy in England led to the exclusion of our
                              breadstuffs, and the necessities of the British treasury tempted to the
                              levying of enormous revenue from our other agricultural products. The
                              interchange between the farmer and manufacturer was thus interrupted.
                              In part it was absolutely prevented; the profit being swallowed up by
                              the impost, the inducement was taken away.

                           <p id="d2e4865">“What did the American Government under these circumstances?
                              Did they say to Great Britain, ‘relax your corn-laws; reduce your
                              duties on tobacco; make no discrimination between our cotton and that
                              from the East Indies; and we will refrain from laying a high duty on
                              your manufactures. You will thus enrich your own people, and it is
                              by no means sure that their increased prosperity may not give you,

                              through the excise and other channels of revenue, more than an
                              equivalent for the taxes we propose to you to withdraw.’
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4871">“Did we say this? No. And why? Because, in the Northern
                              States, there was a manufacturing interest to be advanced by the very
                              course of legislation most fatal to the South. With a dense population,
                              occupying a small extent of barren country, with mountain streams
                              tumbling into deep tide-water, and bringing commerce to the aid of
                              manufactures, they wanted nothing but a monopoly of the Southern
                              market to enable them to enrich themselves. The alternative was before
                              us. To invite the great European manufacturer to reciprocate
                              the benefits of free trade, whereby the South might enjoy all the
                              advantages of its fertile soil and fine climate, or to transfer these
                              advantages to the North, by meeting Great Britain on the ground of
                              prohibition and exaction. The latter was preferred, because to the interest
                              of that section, which, having the local majority, had the power.

                           <p id="d2e4874">“Under this system, Great Britain has never wanted a pretext for
                              her corn-laws, and her high duties on all our products. Thus we sell
                              all we make, subject to these deductions, which, in many instances,
                              leave much less to us than what goes into the British treasury.

                           <p id="d2e4877">“Here, too, is the pretext to the Government of the United States
                              for their exactions in return. The misfortune is, that the Southern
                              planter had to bear both burdens. One half the price of his products
                              is seized by the British Government, and half the value of what he
                              gets for the other half is seized by the Government of the United
                              States.

                              an interest which had not been injured, by the farther injury of
                              one which had been injured. It was impoverishing the South for the
                              benefit of the North, to requite the South for having been already
                              impoverished for the benefit of Great Britain. Still it was ‘indemnifying
                              
                              <hi id="d2e4882" style="font-style: italic;">ourselves</hi>.’ Much virtue in that word ‘
                              <hi id="d2e4885" style="font-style: italic;">ourselves.</hi>’ It is the language
                              used by the giant to the dwarf in the fable; the language of the brazen
                              pot to the earthen pot; the language of all dangerous or interested
                              friendship.

                              case of a woman who was whipped by her husband. She went complaining
                              to her father, who whipped her again, and sent her back.
                              ‘Tell your husband,’ said he, ‘that as often as he whips

                           <p id="d2e4902">“A remedy has been proposed and applied,” replied B—. “The

                              remedy of legislation for the benefit, not of the rulers, but of the
                              ruled.“
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4907">“But in what sense will you say that our legislation has been for the
                              benefit of the rulers alone? Are we not all our own rulers?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4910">“Yes,” replied B—, “if you again have recourse to the use of that
                              comprehensive word ‘WE,’ which identifies things most dissimilar,
                              and binds up, in the same bundle, things most discordant. If the
                              South and North are one; if the Yankee and the Virginian are one;
                              if light and darkness, heat and cold, life and death, can all be
                              identified; then WE are our own rulers. Just so, if the State will consent
                              to be identified with the Church, then WE pay taxes with one hand, and
                              receive them with the other. While the Commons identify themselves
                              with the Crown, ‘WE’ do but pay taxes to 
                              <hi id="d2e4912" style="font-style: italic;">ourselves</hi>. And if Virginians
                              can be fooled into identifying themselves with the Yankees—a
                              fixed tax-paying minority, with a fixed tax-receiving majority—it will
                              still be the same thing; and they will continue to hold a distinguished
                              place among the innumerable WES that have been gulled into their
                              own ruin ever since the world began. It is owing to this sort of
                              deception, played off on the unthinking multitude, that, in the two freest
                              countries in the world, the most important interests are taxed for the
                              benefit of lesser interests. In England, a country of manufacturers,
                              
                              <hi id="d2e4915" style="font-style: italic;">they</hi> have been starved that agriculture may thrive. In this, a country
                              of farmers and planters, 
                              <hi id="d2e4918" style="font-style: italic;">they</hi> have been taxed that manufacturers may
                              thrive. Now I will requite Lord Chatham's well-intentioned declaration,
                              by saying that England ought not to make a barrel of flour for
                              herself. I say, too, that if her rulers and the rulers of the people
                              of America were true to their trust, both sayings would be fulfilled. She
                              would be the work-house, and here would be the granary of the world.
                              What would become of the Yankees? As 
                              <hi id="d2e4921" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> don't call them WE, I
                              leave 
                              <hi id="d2e4924" style="font-style: italic;">them</hi> to find the answer to that question.”

                           <p id="d2e4952">THE impression made on Douglas by these observations was so strong
                              and so obvious, that his friend paused and left him to meditate upon
                              them. Some minutes elapsed before he made any reply. When he
                              did speak, he acknowledged the existence and magnitude of the grievance,
                              and again enquired, with increased solicitude, what remedy had
                              been found.

                           <p id="d2e4959">“I did.” replied Douglas, “and I was as much surprised at the facts
                              hinted at, as disgusted at the sentiments of the speakers.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e4962">“Then your surprise must have been extreme,” said the other; “for
                              I hardly know which amused me most—their unblushing display of
                              selfish meanness, or the glow of indignation in your countenance, which
                              showed how little you know of this world of philanthropy and benevolence
                              that we live in. But had you no suspicion of the cause of those
                              enviable advantages which these sons of Mammon are so anxious to
                              monopolize?”

                              nature has done nothing for the one, and every thing for the
                              other. But the conversation you have heard is a proof that the sand
                              which chokes the waters of the Sound is a trivial obstacle, in comparison
                              with the legislative barriers which have shut out prosperity from
                              the noble Chesapeake. Look at your rivers and bay, and you will see
                              that Virginia ought to be the most prosperous country in the world.
                              Look at the ruins which strew the face of your lower country, the remains
                              of churches and the fragments of tombstones, and you will see
                              that she once was so. Ask for the descendants of the men whose
                              names are sculptured on those monuments, and their present condition

                              will tell you that her prosperity has passed away. Then ask all history.
                              Go to the finest countries in the world—to Asia Minor, to Greece, to
                              Italy; ask what has laid them desolate, and you will receive but one
                              answer, ‘misgovernment.’”

                           <p id="d2e4976">“The fault of submitting to be misgoverned, certainly. But no
                              more than that. Let the 
                              <hi id="d2e4978" style="font-style: italic;">country</hi> enjoy its natural advantages, and
                              they who are too ignorant or too slothful to use them will soon give
                              place to others of a different character. What has there been to prevent
                              the Yankee from selling his barren hills at high prices and coming
                              South, where he might buy the fertile shores of the Chesapeake
                              for a song? No local attachment, certainly—for his home is every where.
                              What is there now to prevent the planter of this neighborhood
                              from exchanging his thirsty fields for the rich and long-coveted
                              low grounds of James River or Roanoke, in Virginia? Are these
                              people wiser, better, more energetic and industrious than the were
                              twelve months ago, that their lands have multiplied in value five fold?
                              Is it your uncle's fault, that, were he now at home the tame slave of
                              power, he could hardly give away his fine estate? The difference is,
                              that this country now enjoys its natural advantages, while Virginia
                              remains under the crushing weight of a system devised for the benefit of
                              her oppressors.”

                           <p id="d2e4992">“I will answer that,” said B—, “because my friend's modesty might
                              restrain him from giving the true answer. It has been obtained by
                              intelligence, manly frankness, and fair dealing. It has been obtained by
                              offering to other nations terms most favorable to their peculiar and
                              distinctive interests, in consideration of receiving the like advantage.
                              Instead of nursing artificial interests to rival the iron and cotton
                              fabrics, and the shipping of England, the wine of France, the silk and
                              oil of Italy, and enviously snatching at whatever benefit nature may
                              have vouchsafed to other parts of the world, this people only ask to
                              exchange for these things their own peculiar productions. A trade
                              perfectly free, totally discharged from all duties, would certainly be
                              best for all. But revenue must be had, and the impost is the best
                              source of revenue. No State can be expected to give that up. But it
                              has been found practicable so to regulate that matter as reduce the

                              I will give you the outline in a few words. These States were first
                              driven to think of separation by a tariff of protection. Their Federal
                              constitution guards against it by express prohibition, and by requiring
                              that the impost, like the tax laws of Virginia, should be annual.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5004">“They have felt the danger to liberty from excessive revenue. Their
                              constitution requires that the estimates of the expense of the current
                              year shall be made the measure of revenue to be raised for that year.
                              The imports of the preceding year are taken as a basis of calculation,
                              and credit being given for any surplus in the treasury, a tariff is laid
                              which, on that basis, would produce the sum required.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5007">“Then there can never be any surplus for an emergency,” said
                              Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5010">“Always,” replied B—; “in the right place, and the only safe
                              place—the pockets of a prosperous people. There is no place in the
                              treasury to keep money. The till of the treasury has a hole in the
                              bottom, and the money always finds its way into the pockets of sharpers,
                              parasites, man-worshippers, and pseudo patriots. But let that pass.
                              You see that a small revenue alone will probably be wanting, and being
                              raised annually, the tariff can be annually adjusted.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5013">“Now, what says justice, as to the revenue to be raised by two nations
                              on the trade between the two, seeing that it is equally levied on
                              the citizens of both?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5016">“On that hypothesis each should receive an equal share of it,” said
                              Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5019">“Precisely so,” answered B—, “and let these terms be held out to
                              all nations, and if one will not accept them another will. On this
                              principle a system of commercial arrangements has been set on foot
                              which, by restoring to these States the benefit of their natural advantages,
                              is at once producing an effect which explains their former prosperity.
                              It places in stronger relief the evils of the opposite system to Virginia,
                              and really leaves her; while she retains her present connexion
                              with the North, without any resource. Tobacco she cannot sell at all.

                              manufactories of the North, from which she will not receive in return
                              the third part as much of the manufactured article as the Carolina
                              planter will get for his. This is her fate. She sees it, and would throw
                              off the yoke. But her Northern masters see it too. She is all that

                              remains to them of their Southern dependencies, which, though not

                              and they are in the condition of the wolf when there are no sheep left.
                              Wolf eat wolf, and Yankee cheat Yankee. This they will guard against
                              by all means lawful and unlawful, for Virginia alone mitigates the
                              ruin that their insatiate rapacity has brought upon them. They will
                              hold on to her with the gripe of death; and she must and will struggle
                              to free herself, as from death.

                              affairs as we now speak of. Is he not an ignorant clown?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5056">“He is all that,” said B. “But he writes as good a hand as Marshal
                              Saxe, and has probably read as many books as Cincinnatus. But
                              to speak seriously, he is no common clown. I picked him up, nearly
                              forty years ago, a little, dirty, ragged boy, without money, without
                              friends, without education, and without principles. All these wants I
                              found means to supply, except that of education, which to him would
                              be quite superfluous. But he now has money sufficient, and friends
                              without number; and, what is better still, he has become an honest
                              man, and discharges the duties of one none the worse for having had
                              a pretty large experience in knavery. Such as he is, he is bound to
                              me by gratitude, such as few men are capable of. More than a dozen
                              years ago, he followed the bent of early habit, and retired to his native
                              mountains, where he has married, and lives after the manner of the
                              country, as if he were worth nothing in the world but his rifle. He
                              has a good deal of money, which I manage for him; and as he has no
                              taste for extravagance of any sort, and is generous as a king, he always
                              has a dollar to spare a friend.

                           <p id="d2e5059">“When I tell you that the people of that district see so little money
                              that they always count it by four-pence-half-pennies, you will readily
                              believe that a little help goes a great way. They don't see that Schwartz
                              has any property; but their opinion of his sagacity and enterprise
                              takes away all wonder at the fact, that he is always able, as well as
                              ready, to give aid to a friend at time of need. You will, of course,

                              infer, that his influence among them is very great. Now that, and all
                              his faculties of body, mind, and purse, are at my command. He is
                              aware of the state of public affairs; adopts all my views, as far as he
                              can understand them, and beyond that point trusts me implicitly. It
                              is through his instrumentality that the minds of the mountaineers of
                              that district are prepared for action at this moment. No force is actually
                              organized, but every thing is ready for the emergency. The dispositions
                              of the people, and the strong fastnesses of the country, will
                              make it a secure retreat to a partisan corps. The materials for such a
                              corps may be found in part among the inhabitants. A nucleus is all
                              that is wanting, and to that all the persecuted and distressed, from
                              every quarter, will gather.”

                              want—men and a leader. Your friend Schwartz must be the very man
                              to command those fellows, and might not like to submit to the authority
                              of another.”

                           <p id="d2e5067">“He is not the man to command,” said B—, “because he could not
                              keep up intelligence with other parts of the country, though as a
                              medium of intelligence there is none better. Indeed he cannot be spared
                              from that branch of service. Besides, though he might command his
                              neighbors, you will be joined by men who will not submit to be commanded
                              by any but a gentleman. As to any reluctance on his part, go
                              to him in my name, or in that of your uncle or aunt, and you command
                              him, body and soul. You will find all his faculties devoted to your
                              service, without envy, jealousy, or grudging; and you will do well to
                              use his mind more than his body. In many particulars he is one of
                              the most efficient men in the world; and as he perfectly understands
                              himself, and knows what he is fit for, you may always leave him to
                              choose his own function, and to execute it in his own way.”

                              that I keep myself out of harm's way, and free from all suspicion, until
                              the time shall come; when I propose to act a part which shall make
                              me a conspicuous mark for the malice or policy of our enemies. Hence
                              I affect to live, and keep myself as much as possible on this side of the
                              line. What you do there must be done in such a way as to indicate
                              no connexion with me. I therefore propose that you accompany my
                              friend here to South Carolina, where you may derive much benefit from
                              seeing the first men in that State, with whom he will make you acquainted.
                              From thence I would have you address letters to your friends
                              (especially those in the army) so worded as to lead them to attribute your
                              change of opinions (which should be made to seem progressive) to the
                              influence of these new associations. A few weeks will be sufficient for
                              this purpose, and you may return to Virginia early in the summer.
                              Here, continued B—, pointing to a map which hung in the room, “is
                              the point at which you will enter the State, and here will be the principal
                              scene of your operations. You will there find Schwartz, to whom
                              you shall be properly accredited, and from whom you will learn the
                              resources to be placed at your command, and the capabilities of the country.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5103">“Now observe  Our object is to organize a small force, under which
                              the district may be protected in declaring for the Independence of
                              Virginia, and prepared to afford a place of refuge to the Legislature,
                              should they be driven from Richmond before they have time to organize
                              the operations of the Government. Of course, they must have an
                              opportunity to assemble there, if but for a day. This it must be

                              care to secure, by a sudden movement from the midland counties on
                              the southern boundary, and in this we 
                              <hi id="d2e5108" style="font-style: italic;">may</hi> need your co-operation.
                              On that point we shall take care to keep you advised.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e5114">Now, our first object being to free Richmond from the presence of
                              the federal army, at the moment the Legislature is to meet, we must be
                              careful to cause no alarm, for the safety of that place. Any movement
                              in that direction would produce a concentration of force there, and
                              increase our difficulties. You should, therefore, be careful so to shape
                              your operations as rather to call the attention of the enemy to other
                              points; and if you can make them of sufficient importance to draw
                              detachments from Richmond, a double purpose will be answered. You
                              will have no cause to fear any force that can be brought against you.
                              Your field of operations affords situations which may defy assault, and,
                              the line of North Carolina being at your back, you may, at any
                              moment, cross it and disband for a time.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5117">“But I am not sure whether our end may not be answered best by
                              giving to all your operations such a character as may exclude the idea
                              of any political object. As none of those who are conspicuous as
                              malcontents in the lower country will join you, this deception will not be
                              difficult. In beating up the quarters of the troops near you, you may
                              seem to act but in self-defence; and should you extend your blow so
                              far as Lynchburg, your mountaineers will hardly fail to levy such
                              contributions on the camp-followers, and Yankee peddlers there, (who call
                              themselves merchants,) as to give the measure the appearance of a
                              mere marauding expedition.”

                           <p id="d2e5120">“I am not so very sure,” replied Douglas, “that I should like to mix
                              my little reputation as a soldier and a gentleman with an affair of that sort.’
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5123">“I am not suggesting anything contrary to the laws of war,” said
                              B—. “The violation of them would be but in appearance. Care
                              would be taken to indemnify any who might be wronged, whenever it
                              shall be expedient for you to throw off the mask. As to any temporary
                              misconstruction, your name would connect you with your uncle, and,
                              through him, with me and all our friends; and moreover, would whet
                              the malice of your worthy friends, the Bakers, who would move heaven
                              and earth to circumvent you. Better, therefore, to drop the last name.
                              Archibald Douglas is name enough to satisfy the ambition of any
                              reasonable man, at least until he can cap it with a yet more honorable
                              addition, if that be possible.”

                           <p id="d2e5127">While this conversation was going on, there was some appearance of
                              embarrassment about Douglas, which did not escape the observation of
                              his uncle. At length he said to him, in an under tone, that, before
                              carrying the matter under discussion any farther, he would be glad to
                              have a few words with him in private.

                           <p id="d2e5130">“I understand your wish,” said the old gentleman, aloud; “it shall
                              be indulged.”

                           <p id="d2e5135">“I suspect you mistake me,” said Douglas, coloring very high.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5138">“Not at all,” replied the other. “You only suppose so because you do
                              not know that one of my friends here received his wife in marriage at
                              my hands, and that the other stood father to mine. Hence I have no
                              such reserves with them as you may suppose. 
                              <hi id="d2e5140" style="font-style: italic;">Now</hi> do I understand
                              you?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5144">“I dare say you do,” replied Douglas, blushing yet more deeply.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5148">“Then, I say again, your wish shall be indulged. You shall not
                              leave us until you are fully established in all the rights which it is
                              mine to confer. But you must suppress your raptures until you hear
                              the conditions. Our plan requires secresy, and above all, that there
                              should be no appearance of concert between you and us, and no cause
                              to suspect it. This thing, therefore, must be absolutely private; no
                              witnesses but those here present, and your aunt, and Lucia; and in the
                              next moment your foot must be in the stirrup. Are you content?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5151">“Content!” said Douglas. “Indeed I am not; but I see that you
                              are acting upon a concerted plan, and that all expostulation must be
                              vain. Let me at least see Delia now.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5154">“I suspect she has gone to bed,” said Mr. T—. “Retired! I believe
                              is the word introduced by our Yankee school-mistresses, whose
                              prurient imaginations are shocked at the name of a bed. Poor girl,
                              she was glad to retire, in the plain English sense of the word, as soon
                              as we got here, and, I dare say, has been in bed half an hour. She
                              and your aunt were on active service all last night, while you were
                              keeping a snoring watch over our friend Whiting. Come, my boy!
                              You shall not infect her with the fever of your brain to-night. If you
                              cannot sleep, it is no reason why she should not. And now let us turn
                              again to other matters.”

                           <p id="d2e5157">“The next question, then,” said the southron, “is how we can aid
                              you? By sword, or tongue, or pen, or purse?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5160">“By purse as much as you please,” said B—. “Our young friend
                              here will need a small military chest, which we have no means of filling.
                              As to the rest, keep out of the scrape. We wish to join you in
                              peace, and then remain at peace, which will not be, if you strike a blow
                              in our behalf now. As much 
                              <hi id="d2e5162" style="font-style: italic;">individual</hi> aid as you please to our
                              rendezvous just before the first Monday in December. A thousand
                              independent volunteers, 
                              <hi id="d2e5165" style="font-style: italic;">pour le coup</hi>, would be welcome. In the
                              meantime, if you can send our young friend here a promising young officer
                              from your military school, to be his second in command, it is all we
                              would ask. Of course, he will come as of his own head, for you must
                              not seem to have anything to do with the matter.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5169">Many other topics connected with our subject were discussed, but I

                              deem it unadvisable to speak of more than is necessary to explain the
                              subsequent situation of the parties. When they met again at breakfast,
                              the swimming eye and changing cheek of Delia told that she had
                              been made acquainted with all that had passed. The countenance of
                              Douglas beamed with high excitement, at once pleasant and painful.
                              A glance of triumphant encouragement to Delia, and her answering
                              tearful smile, showed that they perfectly understood each other.
                              Indeed, it was time they should, for it had been settled that B—, who
                              was a resident and justice of the peace of the county, should perform
                              the marriage ceremony, according to the unceremonious law of North
                              Carolina, immediately after breakfast.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5175">As soon as it was over, they adjourned to the parlor, where B—,
                              drawing Delia to him, seated her on his knee. “I don't half like this
                              business,” said he. “I have no mind to take an active part in giving
                              up my own little girl to this young fellow. I am too old to think of
                              loving and fighting all in a breath, as he does, and I thought to wait
                              till the wars were over, and here he comes and cuts me out. But I
                              am determined to do nothing in prejudice of my claim until I find that
                              I have no chance. Young man,” added he, in a tone gradually changing
                              from playful to serious, “do you love this dear girl with that faithful,
                              single-hearted love, which man owes to a woman who gives him all
                              her heart, and entrusts to him all her happiness and all her hopes?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5178">As he said this he took the hand of Douglas, and went on: “Do
                              you thus love her, and will you in good faith manifest this love, by
                              being to her a true and devoted husband, in every change and vicissitude
                              of life, so long as life shall last? Answer me, Douglas,” he continued.
                              with a voice approaching to sternness, and a fixed and searching look,
                              while he strongly grasped the young man's hand.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5181">“Assuredly I will,” said Douglas, somewhat hurt.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5184">“And you dear,” said B—, resuming his kind and playful tone, “do
                              you love this young fellow in like sort, and will you, on your part, be
                              to him thus faithful as his wife?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5187">While B—said this, the blushing Delia tried to disengage herself;
                              but he detained her, and caught the hand with which she endeavored
                              to loosen his from her waist, and held it fast. At length she hid her
                              face on his neck, whispering:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5190">“You know I do. You know I will.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5194">“Then God bless you, my children,” said B—, bringing their hands
                              together and grasping both firmly in one of his; “for you are married
                              as fast as the law can tie you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5197">In a moment the whole party were on their feet, each expressing a
                              different variety of surprise. Douglas was the first to understand his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5199"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="153" data-tei-n="146"> </a></span>
                              situation fully, as appeared by his springing forward and catching his
                              bride to his bosom, imprinting on her pure cheek the kiss that holy
                              nature prompts, and that all the caprices of fashion (thank God!) can
                              never shame. From him she escaped into the arms of her mother,
                              who, caressing her with murmured tenderness, looked half reproachfully
                              at B—. Then smiling through the tear that filled her large blue
                              eye, she shook her finger at him, and said, “Just like you! just like
                              you!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5202">“Fairly cheated you of your scene, Margaret. All the matronly
                              airs, and maidenly airs, that you and Delia have been rehearsing this
                              morning, gone for nothing. And there is dear little Lucia crying as if
                              to break her heart, because sister Delia was married before she could
                              fix her pretty little face for the occasion. Never mind, dear! When
                              your turn comes there will be less hurry, and you shall have a ceremony
                              as long as the whole liturgy. Well, Douglas, you will not quarrel with
                              me, I am sure; and I think Delia will forgive me for the trick I played
                              her. You have but an hour to stay together, and where was the sense
                              of giving that up to the flutter and agitation of a deferred ceremony?
                              I suspect if I were always to manage the matter in this way, I should
                              have my hands as full of business as the dentist that used to conjure
                              people's teeth out of their mouths without their knowing it, while he
                              was pretending just to fix his instrument. But go, my children.
                              Empty your full hearts into each other's bosoms, and thank me for the
                              privilege.”

                           <p id="d2e5244">AND so it was. I can add nothing to the language of the poet. I
                              can supply nothing to the imagination of the reader. Thus Douglas
                              and Delia parted. He accompanied his new acquaintance to the southern
                              capital; he there met with men whose names live and will live in
                              the history of their country, and whose memories will be honored while
                              virtue is held in reverence among men. From these, and especially
                              from the accomplished gentleman to whose friendship he had been introduced
                              by his uncle and Mr. B—, he received such lights as dispelled
                              every shadow of doubt from his mind. The wrongs of Virginia,
                              her rights and her remedies, became the subject of all his thoughts,
                              and he burned with impatience for the time when he might draw his
                              sword on her behalf, and turn to her use, as he had expressed it, the
                              lessons learned in the school of her oppressors.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5247">That time at length arrived. Returning by the upper road which
                              skirts the foot of the mountains, he re-entered Virginia nearly at the
                              spot to which his brother had gone in quest of him. There, as he had
                              been taught to expect, he found Schwartz, whose reception of him fully
                              justified the assurances of B—. To that gentleman he showed
                              unbounded devotion, delighted to speak of favors received at his hands,
                              and of “moving accidents by flood and field,” which they had encountered
                              together. Next to B—, in his estimation, stood Mrs. Trevor;
                              then Delia, for whom, when a child, he had formed a passionate
                              attachment; and last, Mr. Trevor himself, whom, after the rest, he
                              respected and admired above all human beings. A hint from B—that
                              Douglas was the husband of Delia placed him at once in the same catalogue
                              of worthies, and from the first moment he devoted himself not
                              less to his personal service than to the advancement of the common
                              cause. He had already organized a small corps, the command of which
                              he unreservedly surrendered, making it his constant study to recommend
                              the new commander to the confidence of the men.

                           <p id="d2e5253">No man could deserve it better, or was better qualified to win it.
                              Frank, affable, generous and kind, his deportment was marked by that
                              self-respectful courtesy which has all the good effect of dignity, without
                              ever passing by that name. With nothing repulsive, austere, or cold
                              in his demeanor, he was a man whose orders no soldier would I question,
                              whose displeasure no gentleman would choose to incur, whose feelings
                              no friend, however careless, would wound. Liberally supplied with
                              money by his southern friends, and instructed by Schwartz in the judicious
                              use of it, he took effectual measures to prevent distress in the
                              families of his followers. A small sum amply satisfied their simple
                              wants, and his men had the satisfaction of knowing that their families
                              suffered nothing by their absence from their little farms.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5256">Beside the small embodied corps I have mentioned, the whole population
                              of that warlike district were placed under a sort of organization,
                              so that, while they pursued their occupations of hunting or farming,
                              they were prepared, at any moment, to join an expedition or to resist
                              an attack.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5259">Schwartz, who knew the country, inch by inch, made Douglas acquainted
                              with all its strengths and all its passes, so that he soon became
                              an expert woodsman, and an active mountaineer. His first care
                              was to select a place for a stationary camp. For this purpose he chose
                              a position strong by nature, which he made nearly impregnable. He
                              next provided horses enough to mount a part of his corps. For these
                              the rich herbage of the mountains afforded abundant subsistence during
                              the summer months. Of ammunition there was no stint. The lead
                              mines were just at his back, beyond the Alleghany. Powder is made
                              of good quality in all that region, and the quantity necessary for the
                              rifle is so small, that the rifleman may be said to carry a hundred lives
                              in his powder-horn. Of provisions he had plenty, though wanting
                              many things deemed necessary in a regular army. But the pure air of
                              the mountains, and the exercise of hunting and scouting, preserved the
                              health of the men without tents, or salt, or vinegar, or vegetables of
                              any kind. Venison and beef, dried in the sun, or over the fire by the
                              process called jerking, was prepared in the season of abundance for
                              winter use, and proved the best sort of food for a marauding corps.
                              Light, compact, and nutritious, there is no diet on which a man can
                              travel so far or fight so hard.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5262">Nothing now remained but to make his enemy feel him. Stooping
                              from his mountain fastness, he soon broke up all the military posts
                              in the adjacent counties; so that, in a few weeks, not a blue-coat was to
                              be seen on the south side of Staunton river. Freed from the presence
                              of their enemy, the people were found ready to rise en masse. He dissuaded
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5264"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="156" data-tei-n="149"> </a></span>
                              them from doing more than to put themselves in readiness for
                              action, to furnish him needed supplies, for which he paid fairly, and to
                              give him notice of the approach of the enemy. For this purpose he
                              established a sort of half military organization, and had it in his power
                              to increase his little force to five times its number in a few days. His
                              strength being thus adapted to any occasion which could be expected
                              to offer, after sweeping away the enemy from the south side of the
                              river, he proceeded to break up the posts in the counties on the northern
                              bank. In the end, though the enemy were nominally in possession
                              of all the country between James river and Roanoke, they held no
                              post higher than Lynchburg, nor any farther south than Farmville.
                              Above this last place, their scouts and foraging parties showed themselves
                              occasionally, but never ventured to leave the banks of James
                              river for more than a single night.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5267">At Lynchburg, not long before the time at which our story commences,
                              two companies had been posted. As Douglas had never shown
                              a force of more than a hundred men, no fear of an attack on that point
                              was entertained. But suddenly collecting a number of auxiliaries, he
                              struck at them, drove them from their post, enriched his men with
                              everything that the laws of war permitted him to seize, and retreated
                              to his stronghold in the mountains. The supplies of arms, ammunition,
                              clothing, and blankets thus procured, put him in a condition to
                              increase his corps, if necessary. Thus, at the time of which we speak,
                              having little more than a hundred men embodied, he could have
                              marched five times that number to Richmond; and, for any service
                              nearer at hand, could have commanded a yet larger force. Though
                              unprovided with many of the conveniences of military life, they were not
                              deficient in essentials. There was “not a bit of feather in his host,” nor
                              drum, nor trumpet, nor banner. But there were stout hearts, and
                              strong hands, and fleet limbs, and good rifles, and knives and tomahawks;
                              and that system and harmony which spring from a sense of
                              danger, a high purpose, and confidence in a leader. To the listening
                              ear, a whisper speaks louder than a trumpet to the heedless. To the
                              trusting heart, the chieftain's voice supersedes the spirit-stirring drum.

                           <p id="d2e5271">While Douglas thus maintained his position among the mountains,
                              it became a sort of Cave of Adullam. His little corps was a nucleus
                              to which the discontented and persecuted gathered continually. His
                              embodied force was increased, while the organization of the neighboring
                              population became more perfect, their confidence firmer, their zeal
                              more ardent. So effectually had he broken the power of the Central
                              Government in that quarter, that it had been deemed expedient to
                              throw a much larger force into Lynchburg, to curb his progress in that
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5273"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="157" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span>
                              direction, and to restrain the disaffected in the counties along the north
                              bank of James river. Could he have co-operated with the friends of
                              Virginia there, it was not clear that the flame might not spread on and
                              on, in the direction of Washington, until the very seat of empire might
                              be unsafe. Hence a regiment had been detached from the army at
                              Richmond, and another from the North, originally destined for that
                              place, was turned aside to Lynchburg. Aware of these movements,
                              Douglas had no doubt that the purpose of such an assemblage of force
                              was not merely preventive. He saw that attempts would be made to
                              recover the ground which the enemy had lost on the south side of
                              James river; and that, by remaining strictly on the defensive, he
                              might be forced to withdraw his embodied force to their mountain
                              stronghold, and not only lose the aid of his irregulars, but give them
                              up to the vengeance of the enemy. Under these circumstances,
                              attack was the most effectual form of defence, and boldness was true
                              prudence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5276">The time, too, was at hand for the decisive movement, in the lower
                              counties, for the relief of Richmond. The desired diversion had been
                              effected, and Douglas found himself capable of bringing into the field
                              a force, the presence of which should be no inconsiderable aid to that
                              about to assemble below. To strike at his enemy therefore, to overwhelm
                              him, if possible, and, if not, to elude him and fall down to the
                              assistance of B—, seemed to him the surest plan for preserving the
                              safety and independence even of the mountain region. If successful,
                              every desirable end would be accomplished. Even should he fail, his
                              duty to the faithful yeomanry and peasantry of that devoted section
                              was rather to draw the enemy away after him toward Richmond, than
                              by falling directly back, or even by remaining where he was, to invite
                              them to overrun the country which had afforded him such zealous and
                              efficient co-operation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5279">Influenced by these considerations, Douglas had despatched Schwartz
                              to lay them before B—, and receive his instructions. He had long
                              ago recognized him as the person of whom his aunt had said that “the
                              destiny of Virginia depended on him.” He had received at his hands
                              the sort of authority which he wielded, now indeed by his own personal
                              influence and character, but originally as the trusted representative
                              of B—. He had no mind to shake off that character. He had
                              seen that, by means not exactly understood, that gentleman commanded
                              resources, both at home and abroad, which enabled him to meditate
                              plans in which all the operations of Douglas's corps, however brilliant,
                              were but circumstances of less importance in themselves than in their
                              relations.

                           <p id="d2e5284">Schwartz was the sole medium of communication between the two.
                              With nothing in his appearance to attract attention—nothing in his
                              manners or common style of conversation betokening powers superior
                              to those of any other peasant—his intelligence and fidelity supplied
                              the place of letters. He understood everything, and forgot nothing
                              that was said to him. He therefore carried no papers, and passed
                              unsuspected through the country, amusing, with the most harmless
                              gossip, all he chanced to fall in with. He was a man who knew how to
                              have business anywhere and at any moment; and he passed along more
                              like a sparrow hopping from twig to twig, pecking at a berry here and
                              a leaf there, and never seeming to have an ulterior object, than with
                              the strong-winged flight which indicates a distant and important
                              destination.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5287">In one of Arthur's visits to Lucia, (his betrothal with whom was no
                              longer a secret in her father's family,) he was made acquainted with
                              Douglas's marriage. He was also entrusted with the important information
                              that the gallant leader, with whose exploits the country rung,
                              and whom his imagination had endued with almost superhuman powers,
                              was his own best beloved brother. He was instantly on fire to join
                              him, and Schwartz was instructed to convey to him the necessary
                              intelligence; and, if possible, to fall in with him on the way. But he
                              had been turned aside by objects of higher moment on his return, and
                              Arthur had got ahead of him. Having ascertained this fact in the
                              county of Charlotte, where their roads came together, Schwartz travelled
                              hard to overtake him; left his tired horse at the entrance of the
                              defile, and, following on foot, came up with him as we have seen.

                           <p id="d2e5319">LET us now return to the deep glen, at the bottom of which we left
                              our friend Arthur, accompanied by his mountain guide. Schwartz was
                              welcomed with cordial joy by his comrades, and, having asked for the
                              Captain, was told he was in his tent. Arthur looked around in vain
                              for a tent, but saw none. The beetling crags on both sides of the dell
                              seemed to be the only shelter that the place afforded. But against the
                              rock, a hundred yards below, and directly beneath the spot from which
                              Schwartz had given notice of his presence, hung a piece of tent-cloth.
                              One edge of this was tacked to a pole which lay horizontally against
                              the rocky wall, the ends being supported by forks about ten feet long.
                              This proved to be a sort of door to a wide-mouthed cavernous recess in
                              the rock, deep enough to afford room for the few little conveniences
                              which an officer can expect to keep about him in active service.
                              Approaching this, Schwartz lifted a corner, and our travellers stood in the
                              presence of Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5322">He was seated at a course table, poring over a rude manuscript map,
                              and did not lift his head until he heard the word ‘brother’ uttered by
                              the well-known voice of Arthur. In a moment they were in each
                              other's arms, and, in the next, the new-comer was overwhelmed with
                              questions about his father, mother, and various friends. Some indeed
                              were not named; for, though Schwartz was in the secret of the fact,
                              he was incapable of being let into the deeper mystery of hearts like
                              those of Douglas and Delia. To such the utterance of a beloved name
                              in the presence of the uninitiated is an unpardonable profanation. But
                              though that of Delia was not spoken, Arthur took care so to emphasize
                              his account of the health of his uncle's family, as to convey to the
                              mind of Douglas an assurance of all he wished to hear. But if
                              Schwartz was not deep in the tender mysteries of refined and delicate
                              love, no man better understood a hint, or better knew how to improve
                              it. He accordingly interrupted the conversation, just to say that he
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5324"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="160" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span>
                              brought important intelligence, which must be communicated that
                              night; adding that he would leave them together for an hour. He
                              now withdrew, and afforded the desired opportunity for unreserved
                              conversation.

                           <p id="d2e5328">“My Delia,” said Douglas; “I understand that she is well, and, I
                              hope, happy.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5331">“She is happy,” said Arthur. “She hears of you, from the impartial
                              voice of public fame, in terms that fill her heart with pride, and
                              leave no room there for alarm or melancholy. She feels as becomes a
                              soldier's wife, anxious for her husband's fate, but confident in his
                              fortunes. She has caught this notion from. Mr. B—,who is her oracle,
                              and who seems to have imparted to her, not only all his sentiments, but
                              all the energy and buoyancy of his self-confident mind.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5334">“Thank God!” said Douglas. “Just so would I have her to be. I
                              knew it would be so. I saw her noble mother, when danger threatened
                              my uncle; and I saw her too. But this is the first positive information
                              on 
                              <hi id="d2e5336" style="font-style: italic;">that</hi> point, that has reached me since I have been here. Mr.
                              B—and I can only correspond by messages through Schwartz, and
                              though he is plain and accurate as a printed book in repeating what he
                              understands, yet ideas of this sort are not in his line. And my good
                              and venerable old father—are you here with his permission?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5340">“I am not; nor does he know where I am. I have no doubt that I
                              should have his approbation if he did. I am sure 
                              <hi id="d2e5342" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> have.”

                           <p id="d2e5346">“I!” exclaimed Douglas, with a start of violent surprise. “What
                              does he know of me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5349">“Nothing at all,” said Arthur, smiling. “But he knows of a
                              certain partisan leader, whom the world calls Captain Douglas, .and if I
                              can read the old man's eyes, when he hears that name, he would rather
                              call that man his son than any other on earth.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5353">As Arthur spoke the eyes of Douglas filled, and pressing his hand
                              to his brow, he bowed his head a moment on the table. Then rising,
                              he stood erect, and looking up with a rapt and abstracted air, his eye
                              flashing through his tears, he folded his arms, and speaking in the
                              measured tone of one who feels deeply, but in whose mind thought
                              masters feeling, he parodied that noble speech which Shakespeare puts
                              in the mouth of Prince Henry:

                              of down. Are you prepared, my dear fellow, to partake with me in
                              such feelings? That, I know, depends in part on Lucia. What of

                              fears for the safety of him she loves but when she doubts his truth.
                              Let her feel that she is his second self, and self-confidence calms her
                              fears. Let her feel that she lives in his heart, and, strong in love, she
                              defies the dagger which assails it. Calphurnia trembled for Caesar.
                              Why? He was the husband of every woman in Rome. Had he
                              been true to her, she would have felt only that prudent fear that he
                              would not have derided. He would, perhaps, have yielded to her
                              discreet remonstrance, and her love would have justified the confidence
                              which characterizes the love of woman, by saving his life. But, what
                              a rhapsody I am uttering! You say my father does not know where
                              you are? How is that ?”

                              their minions are all around him. It seems that you are supposed to
                              be in the South for no good purpose, and not without an understanding
                              with him. My disappearance will attract farther notice. For that he
                              cares little; but he is so scrupulous in his notions of honor and truth,
                              that, were he questioned about us, he could hardly conceal any thing
                              he might know. Your letters, I see, still come from the South, though
                              they say nothing of your whereabout. Of course, he thinks you are
                              there; and I, without undeceiving him, simply asked leave to go to
                              look for you. That his feelings are with us, I have no doubt. But he
                              is so beset by spies, and so hampered by the position of our brothers in
                              the army and navy, that he even tries to hide the secret of his thoughts
                              from himself.”

                              afraid, from all he can learn, that them fellows at Lynchburg may be
                              too many for you; so, he says, you must find out exactly how that is,
                              and if you don't think it a pretty good chance, just slip down along
                              the line, toward the middle of November, and join him.”

                           <p id="d2e5416">“Just where the Petersburg railroad crosses the line,” said Schwartz.
                              “You see the folks there are all friendly, because as long as things stay
                              as they are, their railroad an't worth an old flint, and so they are
                              patching up all the old cars, and fixing every thing for the Colonel, as soon
                              as he can start a regiment or so, to make a dash at Petersburg, and so
                              hold on there till the rest of his men join him. Now, if we were to be
                              the first there, Captain, I have a notion that we'd be the very boys for
                              them chaps at Petersburg.”

                           <p id="d2e5419">“I should like that well,” said Douglas. “But I understand my old
                              acquaintance, Col. Mason, at Lynchburg, has a great desire to see me,
                              and I should hate to disappoint him.”

                           <p id="d2e5422">“I don't think he commands there now,” said Schwartz. “There
                              is another regiment come from the North to join him, and they say the
                              other is the oldest colonel.”

                           <p id="d2e5425">“That is of course,” said Douglas, “for Mason is the youngest in
                              the army. But I am not sorry for the exchange, for they have hardly
                              sent as good a one. There is not a man among them I would not
                              rather meet than Mason. Have you been able to learn the particulars
                              of their force there?”

                           <p id="d2e5428">“As well as I can understand,” replied Schwartz, “the whole number
                              is not far from a thousand, and may be a few more.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e5435">“I have not a doubt of it, sir, if we could get at them on fair terms.
                              The people along down between here and Staunton river don't like the
                              thoughts of what them fellows may do to them, and they are keen to
                              take them before they are ready. I talked to the head-men among
                              them as you told me, and they all see that the right way is to try to get
                              the first blow. Because, you see, Captain, when we an't gaining we
                              are losing. If we let the enemy hold Lynchburg, and they find two
                              regiments will not do, they will bring four, and so on, till they get the
                              upper hand, and then they will pay these poor fellows about here for
                              old and new. But if we could make out to give them a real beating,
                              and so drive them clean off, why all the country as far as the Rappahannock
                              would rise that minute, and they'd have enough to do to hold
                              their own at Fredericksburg.”

                              attack one. I had hopes, however, that we might have drawn out the
                              enemy by some device, even when Mason commanded. He is too
                              brave to be ashamed to be prudent. I wish I knew whom they have
                              sent to supersede him. But whoever he is, it is a hundred to one, that
                              being set over the head of an abler man, he will be impatient to show
                              his superiority by reversing his predecessor's plans, and shaming the
                              prudence of Mason by some hasty display of valor. If I did but know
                              who was in command!”

                           <p id="d2e5449">“I tried to find that out,” replied Schwartz; “because I knew you

                              sir, you told me from the first almost exactly how this Col. Mason was
                              going to do. But I could not find any body that could tell me the
                              new Colonel's name. But whoever he is, Mr. B—thinks, and so do I,
                              (but that is nothing,) and I have a notion you do too partly, sir, that
                              if we mean to do any thing with them, we must try to catch them somewhere
                              between here and Lynchburg.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5453">“I am afraid that is all too true,” said Douglas, “and if no such
                              chance offers, we shall have to give them the slip as B—proposes; and
                              I should hate it.”

                           <p id="d2e5456">“And so would I,” said Schwartz; “and so you see, sir, I have
                              been trying to fix a sort of a plan to draw them out, and that is what I
                              want to tell you about.”

                              allotted to fall in with your brother about Little Roanoke bridge, where
                              our roads come together. The people there are friendly, and mighty
                              clever people, and if they don't know all about me, they don't want
                              much of it; for they are our own sort of folks, and true as steel. So
                              I thought I could depend on them to take notice for me when such a
                              man might pass, and let me know. When I got there, by all I could
                              learn, your brother had not gone by; and, as I was pretty tired, and
                              that is one of the places where I commonly lie by to pick up news, I
                              thought I would stop a while.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5488">“I had not been there long, before here comes the Captain that
                              commands the company at Farmville; and, if ever I saw a conceited
                              fool, you may be sure he is one. What he was after, the Lord knows.
                              He said he was a reconnoitering, but I have a notion he was just looking
                              for some body to talk to; and as the folks there an't got much chat
                              for any body, he just claps to talking to me. And he run on about
                              one thing and another, and there was nothing I wanted to know but
                              what he told me, only just I knew it all before. But, I thought, may
                              be, I might get something out of him, so I let him talk, and I sot and
                              listened.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5492">“After a while he gets to talking about you. And, Lord! how he
                              wished you would come in his way; and how he would have served
                              you, if you had tried to beat up his quarters, like you did them fellows
                              at Lynchburg. But he was in hopes to have a clip at you yet,
                              only just you were always hiding and skulking in the mountains, like a
                              wolf, and then coming down in the night to kill sheep. And he
                              reckoned 
                              <hi id="d2e5494" style="font-style: italic;">you knew</hi> where the 
                              <hi id="d2e5497" style="font-style: italic;">dogs</hi> was, and took care to keep out of
                              their way. And then he laughed, and thought he was mighty smart.
                              So, thinks I, ‘stranger, if you have a mind to get into hot water, may
                              be you may have a chance.’ So I speaks up; and, says I, ‘after all, that
                              Captain Douglas an't half the man he's cracked up for, no how.’”

                              tricks enough, and signs and countersigns to keep out of harm's way;
                              but,” says I, “if a man could just get hold of his signs, and so get at
                              him, he an't nothing for a right, real, hard fight.”

                           <p id="d2e5509">“They tell me,” says he, “there an't no such thing as getting in
                              twenty miles of him, or more, may be; and all the folks through the
                              country there stands guard for him, and nobody else know where he is.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5512">“That's very true,” says I;“ but then, you see, stranger, when too
                              many folks has got a secret, then it an't a secret no more.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5515">“It's a wonder,” says he, “some of them don't tell.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5519">“May be they cannot get any thing by telling,” says I. “There's
                              many a poor fellow there, to my knowing, that don't see a dollar once
                              a year, and its mighty little the sight of a few yellow jackets would not
                              make them tell, only just they never seed any, and don't know what
                              they are. But they'd be right apt to find out.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5522">“You talk like you know that part of the country,” says he. “May
                              be 
                              <hi id="d2e5524" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> know something about it.”

                           <p id="d2e5528">“May be I might,” says I. “But then,” says I, “it don't become
                              a poor fellow, like me, to know any thing that a grand officer, with his
                              fine apperlets, all of solid gold, don't know. Lord!” says I, “if I had
                              but half the money you give for your apperlets, I 
                              <hi id="d2e5530" style="font-style: italic;">reckon</hi> I'd know
                              something then.”

                           <p id="d2e5534">“And with that, he looks right hard at me, and says he, ‘may be
                              you'd like to list for a soldier.’
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5537">“May be I would,” says I, “if they pays me well. 'Cause you see,”
                              says I, “sir, as to the country and the President, and all that, its what
                              I don't know nothing about; only I takes their part as takes my part.
                              And that's the reason,” says I, “I would not stay up yonder.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5540">“Why,” says he, “do you live there, when you are at home?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5544">“I cannot say,” says I, “that I have got a home rightly any where.
                              But I did 
                              <hi id="d2e5546" style="font-style: italic;">live</hi> there, after a fashion; and they wanted me to do like
                              the rest of them, and quit my business and keep guard, and stop every
                              man that could not give the signs. And what was I to get by it?
                              Just nothing at all. If I had any bread of my own to eat, why I
                              might eat it; and if I killed a deer, they'd take their share, and
                              thought they did great things if they let me keep the skin; but as to
                              pay, they don't think of such a thing. But that would not do for me,”
                              says I; “and, more than that, it won't do for more, besides me, whatever
                              Captain Douglas may think of it, I can tell him.”

                              bounty, and clothes, and rations, and all. 'Cause,” says he, “the
                              President, he keeps the key of the treasury, and we are his soldiers, and
                              we all live like fighting cocks, I can tell you.”

                              me no odds; and,” says I, “I have been a-thinking, if I could meet
                              with any right clever gentleman, that would pay me for telling, I'd tell
                              it all first, and then list afterwards.

                              if he can get at him; and he is looking every day for more men from
                              the North to help him.”

                              my note for a hundred dollars, to be paid directly after Col. Mason gets
                              a lick at Douglas in the low country, by my help.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5630">“Cannot you give me an order on Mr. Morton, here, in the same
                              way?” says I.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5633">“You are mighty tight,” says he; “but may be I can.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5636">So with that he speaks to Mr. Morton, and he agreed to accept the
                              order. You see, sir, Mr. Morton, as I told you, is a true-hearted
                              Virginian; and he knows me, and I just sorter winked at him, to let him
                              know all was safe. For as to that fellow paying him again, after he
                              paid me, Mr. Morton hadn't no thought of it, nor I neither. But he
                              seed what I was after, and says he to the Captain: “To be sure, sir,
                              its nothing I would not do to serve the country.” And with that they
                              fixed the order all right, and gives it to me, and I slips it back again
                              into Mr. Morton's hand. And then I takes the Captain out again, and
                              tells him the way up here; and, says I, “Now, if you can get to see
                              Captain Douglas, you must fix a good story to tell him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5639">“And what must that be?” says he.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5643">“Why, you have only just to tell him that you have raised a parcel
                              of men in Bedford county, or somewhere thereaway, sorter toward
                              Lynchburg, and you want to know where to join him. Then he'll be
                              sure to tell you when he is coming down out of the mountains, and he'll
                              name a place for you to meet him at, and then if you don't fix him
                              about right, it an't my fault.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5646">“But how am I to get to him?” says he.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5649">“That's it,” says I, “and that's what you never could do without
                              help. You see,” says I, “sir, every man in that country lives by hunting,
                              more or less; and every man has a rifle for himself, and one for
                              every one of his boys, and may be more. And when a fellow is going
                              any where, he never knows when he may see a deer; so you never can
                              catch them without their rifles. But then you may travel all through
                              the country, and you won't see a man that looks any ways like a soldier.
                              And when they want to stop a man, they don't bawl at him and ask
                              for the countersign. That sort of thing may do in an army, but it
                              won't do with folks that have not got an army to back them. So you
                              may fall in with ever so many of them, and they'll find you out; but
                              if they choose to let you pass, you'll never find them out, nor know
                              what they are after.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5652">“But how are they to find me out,” says he, “if they an't got no
                              countersign?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5655">“They an't got no countersign, 
                              <hi id="d2e5657" style="font-style: italic;">rightly</hi>,” says I; “but it is pretty
                              much the same thing, if a man asks a civil question, and you don't

                              there, and you meets one of them fellows, and he was to ask you,
                              mighty innocent like, what parts you were from. What would you
                              say?”

                           <p id="d2e5663">“I don't know,” says he. “May be I'd tell him I was from down
                              about Halifax court-house.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5667">“And that minute,” says I; “he'd know all about you.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5670">“How's that,” says he.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5673">“Why, that's the way they ax for the countersign,” says I.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5676">“What is the countersign?” says he.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5679">“CURRITUCK,” says I; “when they ax you that you must say you
                              come from Currituck.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5682">“And is that all?” says he. “Why that is a countersign, sure
                              enough. But don't they never change it?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5686">“No,” says I; “the men are too much scattered all through the
                              country, for that; but it answers mighty well, the way they fix it.
                              They don't let you off with one question, just so, but they'll ask you
                              a heap more; and they'll say a heap of simple things to you, just to
                              hear what you'll say; and just about the time you think you have
                              fooled them, they'll find you out. There's a parcel of sharp fellows
                              up thereaway, mind, I tell you; and you'll have to get your lesson
                              mighty well before you go there. You see, some will ask you one
                              question and some another. You don't know what its going to be; so
                              I must tell you all the straight of it, and you must practise before we
                              part; and then,” says I, “you can write it all down, and all the way
                              you go you can be saying it over.” So, with that, sir, I tells him the
                              biggest part of our questions: but you may be sure I give him wrong
                              answers to every one of them. But then I told our people at the different
                              stations along about him, and told them to pass him, and never
                              let him know but what his answers were all right. So then I tells him
                              that when he got to you, you would want to know, may be, how he
                              came by the signs; and, says I, “when he axes you that, you must tell
                              him you got them from Job Dixon,” says I. “That's a fellow the
                              Captain keeps busy recruiting away down the country, and when he
                              hears that, he won't suspicion you the least in the world; 'cause you
                              see,” says I, “the man they call Job Dixon has got another name
                              besides that, and that name an't nothing but a sort of countersign
                              for the Captain to know the men by that he sends in.” You see,
                              Captain, I fixed all this way, that I might let you know exactly, so that
                              if the fellow should come when I was out of the way, you might know
                              what to think of him, just as if I was here. And it won't do to let
                              him see me, no how.

                           <p id="d2e5713">“Why the Colonel says,” replied Schwartz, “that he wants you to
                              join him at his rendezvous about the last of November, or may be
                              a little earlier; so whatever you do ought to be done time enough to fall
                              back, if we get worsted, and slip along down the line, according to
                              your old plan. So I am a thinking it would be well to fix the time for
                              meeting this fellow about the tenth of the month, and then, if we can
                              catch them in their own trap, we shall have time to follow up the blow
                              and break up their whole establishment there at Lynchburg, and then
                              march boldly down the straight road.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5716">“Do you know of any crossing place on Staunton river, in the direction
                              of Lynchburg,” asked Douglas, “that would answer for an ambuscade?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5719">“I have a notion,” said Schwartz, “that Jones's Ford would suit as
                              well as any other; because there's a deep hollow comes down on both
                              sides of it, and thick woods on the hills.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5722">“That will do then,” said Douglas. “So now let us take our supper
                              and go to rest; for I must be at the piquet in time to meet your
                              man. Before you go to sleep, suppose you send one of our boys to tell
                              them to stop him if he gets there before me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5726">The supper was produced, and fully justified what Witt had told
                              Arthur of the fare he might expect. As to lodging, bear-skins were
                              plenty, and so were blankets, which had been collected during the
                              expedition against Lynchburg. But a rock is a hard bed, put on it
                              what you will. Yet youth, and health, and high excitement, gave
                              Arthur a most luxurious supper, and a night of such sleep as the best
                              lodged prince in Europe might envy.

                           <p id="d2e5746">WHEN Arthur awoke, he found himself alone. The sun was high
                              in the heavens, but a deep shadow hung over the dark glen, into which
                              his rays never looked, except at noon-day. Arthur now walked out,
                              and amused himself with gazing around on the singular spot which his
                              brother had chosen as a place of refuge. It was, indeed, a place of
                              strength, which seemed calculated to bid defiance to any thing but
                              famine.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5749">The glen, at this point, might be some two hundred feet deep. Above
                              and below, the little stream filled the whole chasm, pouring furiously
                              along between overhanging cliffs. The tops of these, except in the
                              immediate vicinity, were crowned with lofty trees, which, nodding to
                              each other across the gulph, in some places nearly intermingled their
                              branches. The valley, just where Douglas had pitched his camp, was
                              somewhat wider. Just above, the stream seemed to gush from the very
                              bowels of the mountain, dashing, as it tumbled over a fall of twenty
                              or thirty feet, against the dark evergreens which clustered both sides
                              of the gulph. From thence flowing through a wider space, it still
                              confined itself to a narrow and deep channel, scooped into an almost
                              cavernous bed, under the western cliff. Thence, turning abruptly to
                              the southeast, it swept across the dell to the opposite hill, from which
                              it again recoiled in like manner. There was thus, on each side, between
                              the hill and the receding stream, a spot of dry ground, or rather rock.
                              It was indeed nothing but a rocky shelf, a little above inundation,
                              jutting in a half moon from the base of the cliff. About the middle of
                              its passage from hill to hill, the stream tumbled over a ledge, the highest
                              points of which, rising above the water, served as stepping stones, and
                              afforded a passage across, practicable indeed, but neither commodious,
                              nor, to the eye of a stranger, even safe.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5753">The sort of stair which afforded the only approach to this savage
                              den, hung directly over the stream at the point where, having crossed
                              from the western side of the glen, it again whirled back, leaving, as I
                              have said, a dry spot on its eastern margin. At the upper corner of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5755"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="171" data-tei-n="164"> </a></span>
                              this shelf, where it touched the cliff, the path reached the bottom;
                              and an hundred yards below, at the lower extremity of the same
                              platform, hung the tent-cloth that indicated the quarters of the
                              chief.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5758">The sort of cave, the mouth of which was concealed by this, was but
                              a deepening of the recess under the cliff, which every where afforded a
                              partial shelter from the weather, and a complete defence against rocks
                              tumbled from above. Under this were the rude beds and camp-fires of
                              the men, and in front of them a breast-work of logs, raised high enough
                              to afford protection from any shot fired from the opposite hill. Between
                              the upper log and that next below it, was a sort of loop-hole, made
                              by cutting corresponding notches in each; and as the edges of
                              the cliffs had been shorn of all their growth, a man could not
                              show himself on either, without being exposed to the fatal fire of
                              men directing their aim with a rest, and in all the coolness of perfect
                              safety.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5761">The most curious part of the whole establishment was a sort of mill.
                              At the point where the stream, breaking over the rocky ledge of which
                              I have spoken, swept away around the shoulder of the platform, was
                              placed a small log pen. The end of a shaft, projecting from it, overhung
                              the water. Into this were driven stakes, fitted at one end into
                              large auger-holes, and, at the other, spread out like a broad oar. These
                              fan-like extremities dipped in the water, and, yielding to its force, kept
                              the shaft revolving night and day. Machinery equally rude connected
                              its movements with those of a pair of light mill-stones, which found no
                              rest, and required no attention. Though grinding less than a bushel
                              in the hour, it still ground on and on, affording coarse bread for the
                              whole company, and showing how true the old adage, that “fair and
                              softly go far in a day.” One man was seen to replenish the hopper.
                              Others were passing and re-passing, each with his share of meal. The
                              whole was covered with rude boards. Exposed to the fire of each
                              cliff, it was, of course, capable of being made to command both, and
                              some of its features showed that it was intended to be occupied as a
                              tower of strength in case of attack.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5764">In short, to the unpracticed eye of Arthur, the whole presented the
                              appearance of impregnable security and well arranged preparation.
                              There was indeed no present danger, but the place had been chosen
                              and fitted with a view to the last extremity. The course of the stream,
                              tending to the South, led in a few miles into the State of North
                              Carolina, and in that direction there was an outlet practicable,
                              though difficult. Between the camp and the State line there was
                              no point at which the glen could be entered; and Douglas, if
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5766"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="172" data-tei-n="165"> </a></span>
                              driven to retreat in that direction, had none but natural obstacles to
                              overcome.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5769">Cold weather was now approaching, and there was no station where
                              the troops of Douglas were so little exposed to the severity of the season
                              as this. The soft air from the waterfall, though never warm, was
                              never intensely cold, and no other wind but that from the South ever
                              entered the glen. Hence as many men as were not engaged on active
                              duty were assembled here. Still the number present was but small.
                              Some were at the piquet, some on the scout. Besides, it was now the
                              hunting season, and many were abroad in the woods, as the carcasses
                              brought in during the course of the morning plainly showed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5772">Arthur now looked around for Schwartz, and hearing his voice behind
                              one of the breast-works, passed around the end of it, and silently
                              joining the circle, listened to his discourse, which seemed to be a sort
                              of military lecture.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5776">“You see, boys,” said he, “as to 
                              <hi id="d2e5778" style="font-style: italic;">tictacs</hi>, or whatever they call it,
                              that sort of thing an't made for the like of us. When a parcel of
                              fellows lists for soldiers, just because they an't got nothing else to do,
                              and may be one half of them is cowards, and the other half not much
                              better, they are obliged to have rules to go by. Because, if once you
                              can beat it into a fellow's head that after he has got into danger it is
                              safer for him to stand still than to run away, why then the worse scared
                              he is the surer he will be to stay there. But it an't so with us, because
                              if any of us was any way scary, he would not be here no how.
                              The only rule for us is the Indian rule.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5782">“In the first place, it is our business always to know where the
                              inimy is before he knows where we are, and then, if we don't want to
                              fight him, keep out of his way. Now the right way to do that, is just
                              to squander, like a flock of partridges.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5785">“Then if you are going to fight, the only rule is to give the word,
                              and let every man kill all he can, and take care of himself the best he
                              can. Now that way the riglars fight—if one man in ten kills a man,
                              they call it desperate bloody work. But I reckon if there was an
                              inimy now coming up the valley to the foot of the Devil's Back-bone,
                              and the word was to kill all we could before he got there, any of us
                              here would feel mighty cheap if he did not kill somebody.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5788">“And mind, boys, whether we fight or run, whether we keep
                              together, or squander, ‘two and two’ is the word. You must all mate
                              yourselves two and two, to stand together and run together, to fight
                              together and die together. One of you must call himself number one,
                              and the other number two, and then, if there's a hundred together and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5790"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="173" data-tei-n="166"> </a></span>
                              the inimy comes, number two never fires till number one has fired and
                              loaded again. You see, men, a fellow takes good aim when he knows
                              there's another one by, to hit if he misses; and fifty rifles in that way
                              will do more than a hundred when every one knows that's his last
                              chance. Fifty rifles will stop a troop of horse, and a hundred cannot
                              do no more. But if the guns are all empty, then here comes what's
                              left of them slashing away with the broad-swords like devils. But let
                              there be a few more guns to pepper away at them while the first are
                              loading, and they will go to the right-about mighty quick.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5793">“Now mind what I tell you, boys, and the first time it comes to the
                              pinch, you'll say old Schwartz didn't fight Indians so long for nothing.
                              And as to running, any man that's afraid to run when he sees cause,
                              is half a coward, any how. Do you run just when you please. I God!
                              I'd hate to depend on a man to fight that I could not trust to run.
                              There is no harm in running, if you know where you are running to,
                              and your friends know it too; and the right way is to fix a place, every
                              morning, to meet at night, and let every man get there as he can, and
                              do what mischief he can. But, mind, if it comes to that, always run
                              two and two, and then one can help another; and if one comes up
                              missing, the other can tell what's become of him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5796">“I'm telling our boys,” continued Schwartz, who now observed
                              Arthur, “some of the lessons I learned among the Shawnees. You see,
                              Mr. Arthur, (you must not think strange of my calling you so, sir, for
                              all your family seem like my own flesh and blood to me—for all you
                              don't know how that is;) you see, sir, the Captain is a regular officer,
                              built plum from the ground up; but for all that, he knows that all this
                              is true; and, before now, when he and I have been setting over the
                              fire, at night, he has told me about one Gineral Braddock, I think they
                              called him, that got his men shot all to pieces, and himself, too, just
                              because he would not believe that there was any other way to fight but just
                              his way. Now, you see, sir, the reason why he was taken at an 
                              <hi id="d2e5798" style="font-style: italic;">onplush</hi>
                              was, that he was fighting agin Indians. Well, suppose we fight Indian
                              fashion—will not that be pretty much the same thing? May be we
                              an't exactly up to that, but we must do the best we can; for as to
                              fighting the riglars just in their own way, why they'll beat us as long
                              as the sun shines.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5803">“Do you mind that night,” continued Schwartz, laughing, “when
                              the Lieutenant and his men came there to your uncle's to take him and
                              the Captain? That was Indian play for you. I God! if I had not
                              
                              <hi id="d2e5805" style="font-style: italic;">heard</hi> that the Colonel was there, I should have knowed he was at the
                              fixing of that business. You see, sir, that is what a man learns by
                              living in places where a body is never safe; and the upshot of it is, that
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5808"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="174" data-tei-n="167"> </a></span>
                              after a while he gets so that he never can be in any danger. It's like
                              learning to sleep with one eye always open.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5811">Schwartz now rose from the ground, where he had been sitting, and
                              brushing the ashes from his leathers, joined Arthur, and they repaired
                              to the tent where their simple meal awaited them. From him the
                              youth learned that his brother had repaired to the piquet at an early
                              hour; and to the piquet, gentle reader,

                           <p id="d2e5847">DOUGLAS was at the piquet long enough before the arrival of his
                              guest, to make such arrangements as should prevent the stranger from
                              suspecting that this was not the camp he was desirous to see. He had
                              no mind that his enemy should know the real nature and precise position
                              of his main stronghold. Hence he had determined to give him
                              the meeting at the piquet, and took pains to provide, as if for his own
                              ordinary accommodation, such a breakfast as he would have been content
                              to furnish at his own quarters for the most honored visiter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5850">The spy, who had learned little of his profession but that self-indulgent
                              art which is technically called “playing old soldier,” had been in
                              no haste to leave his rest, and Witt, who understood Schwartz's game,
                              did not hurry him. The breakfast hour, therefore, had fully arrived
                              before he made his appearance. He came accompanied by Witt and
                              another of his party; and, in appearance and manners, fully answered
                              the description of him given by Schwartz. He was a tall, red-haired
                              man, vain, pert, and full of self-complacency. Indeed, so much did
                              he display of a satisfaction, at once chuckling and childish, that Douglas,
                              even though unwarned, must have suspected treachery. Besides, he
                              never could have believed a being, manifestly so frivolous and foolish,
                              capable of the high purpose of devoting himself to a life of toil,
                              hardship, and danger. The vain and self-indulgent may receive momentary
                              impulses, under the influence of which brilliant achievements may be
                              suddenly accomplished; but from such the tasks of study, virtue, and
                              enduring courage, must never be expected.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5854">He seemed, at first, more intent upon his breakfast than anything
                              else, and when it appeared, made faces at his coarse fare which ill
                              accorded with his professed indifference to all personal inconvenience.
                              But, bad as it was, he contrived to swallow enough to show that he was
                              not prepared to play the ascetic any more in regard to the quantity
                              than the quality of his food.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5857">“You see,” said Douglas, “the life we lead. If you are not prepared

                              to submit cheerfully to privations, compared to which what you
                              see here is luxury, you should not join us.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5862">“Damn luxury,” said the other. “What do I care about luxury?
                              To be sure, I have been used to it all my life; coffee or tea, one, every
                              morning for breakfast; and good light bread, and potatoes and pies; and
                              then, for dinner, pork or fresh meat, or codfish at least every day in the
                              week, and all sorts of 
                              <hi id="d2e5864" style="font-style: italic;">sass</hi>; and then pies again, and cheese, and all that. But I am
                              ready to give it all up to serve my country, and live as hard as anybody.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5868">“I am glad to hear it,” said Douglas, drawing some papers from his
                              pocket. Among these he affected to search in vain for a particular paper,
                              and in doing so, carelessly throw on the table the letter endorsed
                              with the name Job Dixon. He saw that it caught the other's eyes,
                              and, expressing some dissatisfaction at his own carelessness, said: “You
                              have a right to know, before you join us, all about our force, and I
                              ought to show you my last return; but I have it not at hand, though I
                              believe I know pretty well the number of my men. But stay,” continued
                              he, interrupting himself with a start, and looking at the gallant
                              Captain with a keenness that made his very back ache, “How came
                              you by my pass-words, sir?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5871">“I got them from a man they call Job Dixon,” replied the trembling
                              Captain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5874">“Job Dixon!” replied Douglas, immediately resuming his complacency,
                              “then all is right.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5878">“O yes, all is right,” said the other, recovering from his alarm, but
                              more fluttered and confused than ever. “He told me that wa'nt his
                              name, sure enough, and he said that name was only a sort of a countersign
                              to you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5881">It cost Douglas some effort to suppress a smile at seeing the delicate
                              and dangerous office of a spy undertaken by one so destitute of all the
                              qualities necessary to it; but he commanded himself, and asked whether
                              the other was now content to join him.

                           <p id="d2e5884">“To be sure I am,” said he; “and not only I, but fifty more as good
                              fellows as ever stepped shoe-leather. You see, that was what I doubted
                              about. I thought may be as I had such a company, I had a right to
                              set up for myself; but after I heard all about you from that man, Job
                              Dixon, or whatever else his name is, I made up my mind to join you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5887">“Where are your men?” asked Douglas.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5890">“They are all about home yet,” said the Captain, “but I can bring
                              them together any day, and any place you please to name. I suppose
                              you don't mean to stay up here in the mountains all the time, and may
                              be it might suit as well for me to fall in with you somewhere.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5893">“That is true,” said Douglas. “We are not so well off here for rations
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5895"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="177" data-tei-n="170"> </a></span>
                              as to want anybody before we have use for them. As long as we
                              stay here we are strong enough. A regiment of men could not climb
                              the Devil's back-bone before our faces. But I propose to move shortly,
                              and should be glad of a reinforcement on the way. What county are
                              your men in?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5899">“In Bedford county,” replied the other, repeating his lesson exactly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5902">“That will do, then,” said Douglas. “I propose to march against
                              Mason, at Lynchburg, early in November, and on the fifth day of the
                              month I will meet you at Jones's Ford, on Staunton river.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5905">“I cannot say that I know exactly where that is,” said the spy.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5908">“It is little out of your way into any part of Bedford county,” said
                              Douglas; “and as I want to see some of our friend's down in that quarter,
                              I will ride there with you. I am told Mason is pretty strong, and
                              I want to get all the force I can, and that is not so much but what I
                              shall be glad of your help.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5911">“How many men have you?” asked the Yankee Captain.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5914">“I have but a handful 
                              <hi id="d2e5916" style="font-style: italic;">here</hi>, just now; but I am sending out orders
                              for more to join on the route, and I am in hopes to reach the river
                              with four hundred at least. I shall stay there, at all events, till more
                              come in; because it would be foolish to attack Mason's regiment with
                              less than five or six hundred.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5921">“That will do,” said the other; “for Mason is not more than four
                              hundred strong.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5924">“Indeed!” replied Douglas, affecting surprise and pleasure. “Then I
                              am pretty sure of him. I had heard as much before, but I don't trust
                              everybody. I was afraid there was a trap set for me; but now I am
                              satisfied, and if I can leave Staunton river with six hundred men, I
                              shall gather force enough before I get to Lynchburg to drive Mason
                              and his regiment before me like chaff.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5927">Having said this, Douglas set about the necessary arrangements for
                              accompanying his new acquaintance to Jones's Ford. As the distance
                              was too great for one day, he proposed to pass the night at the house of
                              a trusty friend, from whence the Yankee officer would have it in his
                              power to reach a tavern, two miles beyond the river, the next day.
                              He now despatched a note to Arthur, saying that he wished to examine the
                              ground at the river, in company with him and Schwartz. He therefore
                              directed them to follow at a cautious distance, so as not to be seen
                              by the spy; to pass them in the night, and take up their quarters at a
                              house in advance, and the next day proceed to the dwelling of Mr.
                              Gordon, (a staunch friend,) near the river, and wait for him there.
                              Meantime a horse, that stood piqueted hard by, was saddled, and Douglas
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5929"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="178" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span>
                              set out, accompanied by the treacherous Captain and the faithful
                              Witt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5932">The journey was made without any occurrence worth noting. In
                              the conversation of the stranger there was nothing to beguile Douglas
                              from his own thoughts. The vain babble of the prating coxcomb was
                              all wasted on the impenetrable Witt; and, after a few fruitless attempts
                              to overcome the taciturnity of his companions, he followed their example,
                              and the greater part of the journey was made in silence. Late on
                              the second evening they reached the river. The spy was directed to
                              the public house on the other side, and Douglas and Witt returned to
                              Mr. Gordon's, where they found Arthur and Schwartz.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5935">As they were now in a land of civilization and comfort, Douglas was
                              not sorry to obtain, once more, a good night's lodging, which his
                              hospitable friend was delighted to afford. But this rare enjoyment did
                              not make him forgetful of the necessity of watching the motions of
                              his enemy. He accordingly despatched a scout to the house to which
                              the Yankee had been directed, to make sure that he had gone on.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5938">At a late hour the man returned, and roused Douglas to inform him
                              that the spy had indeed gone as far as he had intended, and that he
                              had there fallen in with a party of a dozen dragoons, commanded by a
                              subaltern, who were on a scout through the country. With this officer
                              he had been seen to be engaged in private and earnest conversation,
                              and orders had been issued to the men to look well to the condition of
                              their arms, and to be in readiness to move at daylight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5942">It at once occurred to Douglas that a new scheme had entered the
                              head of the vain and frivolous being who had thrust himself into an
                              affair requiring qualities so different. It was probable that he wished
                              to avail himself of the presence of this little party to endeavor to surprise
                              his enemy, whom he had reason to believe to be still near the
                              Ford. The folly of risking the defeat of his favorite enterprise by
                              joining in the attempt, and thus throwing off his mask, was not likely
                              to occur to him. The question with Douglas was, whether by abiding
                              the attack he should afford the bungling fool, whom he had been leading
                              into his own trap, a chance to escape from it by his own blunder. In
                              this apprehension, however, he did not give that worthy due credit for
                              his discretion. He had indeed considered Douglas as his proper prey;
                              and though he had been unable to restrain his disposition to babble, he
                              sorely repented his indiscretion when he found the other officer disposed
                              to anticipate him. He had accordingly earnestly dissuaded him
                              from attempting anything; and, not prevailing in this, had determined
                              to go on alone, and leave the other to execute his project as he
                              might.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5945"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="172"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5947">But though uncertain what might be the conduct of the spy, Douglas
                              could not resist his inclination to throw himself in the way of the
                              expected attack. It was necessary that he should examine the ground
                              carefully, and he had not time to wait until the scouting party should
                              have left the neighborhood. Besides, he was anxious to inform himself
                              precisely of the force and position of the enemy, and the name of
                              their new commander. For this purpose he was eager to make at least
                              one prisoner. And, after all, perhaps not the least moving consideration
                              was his desire to taste once more the stormy joy of battle.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5950">Upon the whole, he determined to turn the tables on his enemy,
                              if possible; and, instead of returning to bed, prepared immediately
                              for action. All things were soon ready. The master of the house, his
                              two sons, and three of the neighbors, who, hearing that he was there,
                              had called to see him, added to his own party, made a force of ten men,
                              with which he was not afraid to abide the attack of thirteen. At
                              the head of these he took the road, and by daylight had occupied the
                              ground where he wished to meet the enemy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5953">At the point of which we speak, the road, after passing for some
                              miles over a broad and level ridge, at the distance of a quarter of a
                              mile from the river, dives suddenly into a steep defile between two
                              hills. The descent is rapid, and in less than a hundred yards, the
                              hills come down abruptly on either hand, leaving between them barely
                              space enough for the road, which is quite narrow. They are steep,
                              rugged, with projecting rocks; and altogether impracticable to cavalry;
                              and are moreover covered with a heavy growth of timber and brushwood.
                              At the distance of about two hundred yards from the plain
                              above, the road turns sharp to the right. It then pursues a course
                              nearly direct, for a like distance; and then, turning short to the left,
                              the river, ford, and the opposite landing, are at once in fall view.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5956">A point a little below the first mentioned bend was selected by Douglas
                              for his position. He posted Witt and three others on one side of
                              the road, behind rocks and trees, while he, Arthur, and one more, disposed
                              themselves, in like manner, on the other. Schwartz, with the rest,
                              passed through the defile, with orders to hide themselves near the
                              bank, and let the enemy pass without interruption. A pole had been
                              thrown across the road, some twenty yards in front of Douglas and his
                              party. The crossing of this, by the enemy, was to be the signal for
                              firing. The officer was designated to be the mark of Witt. The right
                              and left hand man of the leading file had each his appropriate executioner
                              appointed; then the two next, and then two more, were in like
                              manner foredoomed, so that no shot should be thrown away. While
                              these arrangements were making, Arthur bethought him of Schwartz's
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5958"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="180" data-tei-n="173"> </a></span>
                              lecture on tactics, and was at once sensible of the vast superiority of
                              untaught courage and sagacity, on occasions like this, over the sort of
                              discipline on which the martinet is so apt to pride himself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5962">About sunrise the enemy appeared, consisting, as the scout had said,
                              of a dozen men, under the command of a single officer. To the great
                              relief of Douglas, the redoubtable Yankee Captain was not with them.
                              As the hill was steep, they advanced in a walk, while the officer, who
                              was in the rear, occasionally turned his horse's head to the hill, seeming
                              to examine for some recess in which his party might draw aside,
                              and form a sort of ambuscade; but there was no such spot. The
                              ground was everywhere too steep for cavalry; and, disappointed, he
                              put spurs to his horse, and pushed forward to resume his place at the
                              head of the party. They were now near the fatal point; every rifle
                              was in rest, and duly levelled at its mark, and in the moment that the
                              leading file were crossing the pole, six saddles were empty, and six
                              horses ran masterless. The aim of Witt at the officer, who was much
                              more distant, and moving rapidly, was less fatal. But his ball took
                              effect, as was plainly shown by the sword arm, which, at the moment,
                              fell powerless. The men went to the right about in a moment, and a
                              shout, which the echoes of the steep gorge multiplied into a hundred
                              voices, sent them down the hill at full speed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5965">The officer, though wounded, was not quite so ready to take to his
                              heels, and called to his men to halt. With all but one, he succeeded;
                              but that one, wild with terror, dashed on. In the meantime, Schwartz
                              and his little party had planted themselves in the road, near the river,
                              and their array was the first object that met the eye of the affrighted
                              soldier as he turned the angle of the road. But panic is as apt to
                              hurry a man into danger as away from it, and the sight of this new
                              enemy only urged the poor wretch to a more desperate effort to escape,
                              by breaking by them. In vain did the men throw up their arms, and
                              call to him to stop. He rushed on, right upon Schwartz, who stood in
                              the middle of the road, and who, as a 
                              <hi id="d2e5967" style="font-style: italic;">

                              </hi> stopped his career
                              with a bullet. The report of his rifle, and a glimpse of Douglas's men
                              advancing along the side of the hill to get within shot, decided the
                              officer that it was time to look to his safety. Turning the angle of the
                              road, he saw the fate of his fallen soldier, and the cause of it.
                              Immediately calling on his men to follow, he dashed on with an impetuosity
                              which showed a determination to force a passage or perish.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5974">The result was inevitable. Schwartz was in the act of loading his
                              rifle. The other three levelled theirs. They had not been trained in
                              Schwartz's school of tactics, and all three, attracted by the epaulette
                              and plume and sash of the officer, fired at him. He fell dead, and the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5976"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="181" data-tei-n="174"> </a></span>
                              rest, perceiving their advantage, rushed on the mountaineers, who, of
                              necessity, sprang aside, and let them pass. One of them was not so
                              nimble but that, as he clambered up the rocky face of the hill, a
                              sweeping back-handed stroke inflicted a deep gash in the back part of his
                              thigh. This was the only injury received by the party of Douglas in
                              the affair, and dearly did it cost the man who gave it. Schwartz
                              marked him, and coolly went on loading his rifle. By the time he had
                              effected this, the soldier was half way across the river, and the next
                              moment tumbled from his horse, and went floating down the stream.
                              The other five gained the shore before another rifle could be loaded,
                              and, doubling a rocky point around which the road turned, disappeared.

                           <p id="d2e5987">THIS victory, though on a small scale, was complete in itself. It
                              was a favorable omen, too, and might serve as a sort of rehearsal of
                              the more important battle to be fought on the same ground. In one
                              thing only Douglas had been disappointed, by the eagerness of
                              Schwartz's men. He had made no prisoners, and the fallen enemy
                              were all either dead, or not in condition to be harassed by such questions
                              as he wished to ask. They were necessarily committed to the
                              care of such of the party as lived in the neighborhood; and their
                              horses and arms being secured, were placed in the same hands for safe
                              keeping.

                           <p id="d2e5990">The feelings of Arthur, as he looked on this fearful scene of slaughter,
                              were such as might be expected to possess the mind of a youth,
                              who, as yet, had never seen the blood of man shed in strife. But
                              these are nothing to the purpose of my tale. It is enough to say, that
                              the contemplation of it wrought the usual change in his character. He
                              now felt that to kill or be killed was the order of the day; and, though
                              his next sleep was haunted by visions of the ghastly objects that lay
                              before him, he awoke from it with a mind prepared for the stern duties
                              of war.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5993">Requesting the company and advice of his host, Douglas now proceeded
                              to examine the ground. He found the river hills every where intersected,
                              on both sides of the river, by ravines such as that I have described.
                              The ford was shallow, but just above was deep water, which, on
                              the north side, came down quite near to the gravel bar, which served as a
                              dam. Here a steep and high rock bounded the river, and along the
                              base of it, the water eddied in a deep pool, and then swept away in a
                              strong, but shallow current. At a short distance below was the mouth
                              of a ravine, overgrown with lofty trees, and clustering with brushwood,
                              at a distance of fifty yards from the landing-place. The road, issuing
                              from the river at the foot of the rock, holds a straight course for twenty
                              yards, or thereabouts, and then turning short to the left, is no more
                              in sight of the river. From thence, a short, but steep assent through
                              a deep cleft in the hills, brings the traveller to the top, where he turns
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e5995"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="183" data-tei-n="176"> </a></span>
                              again to the right, and resumes the direction towards Lynchburg.
                              After a thorough examination of the whole, the party returned to
                              breakfast at the house of Mr. Gordon.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e5999">Douglas rode slowly and thoughtfully. At length he said apart to
                              Schwartz:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6002">“Your plot is admirable; but I am afraid it will fail.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6005">“What chance of that?” asked Schwartz. “They will be ashamed
                              to bring more than a thousand men against you, even if they had
                              them. We can raise as many as they can, and we shall be on the
                              ground, and have the same advantage we had just now.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6008">“But suppose they come and take possession first,” said Douglas.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6011">“Oh! no danger of that. They'll be in no hurry to leave their
                              snug quarters any sooner than they can help; and we can be here a
                              day or two before the time.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6014">“It may be so,” said Douglas, “but I don't think Col. Mason takes
                              me for an absolute fool; and if he does, he has reason to know that I
                              have sharp-witted men about me. But any man's wits may fail him
                              sometimes. For example, it has never occurred to either of us, that
                              Mason will certainly not believe that we have been fooled by such a
                              fellow as this Yankee of yours. Will he not, therefore, at once
                              suspect the truth, and conclude that we are trying to catch him in his
                              own trap?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6018">“I God!” said Schwartz, “that is true. I had not thought of that.
                              The fellow is too silly to be made bait of, sure enough. But then, you
                              see, Captain, we can fix them any how. Mr. Gordon here can raise
                              men enough, in three days, to keep them from crossing the river, until
                              we are ready for them, and then, you know, we can push across a part
                              of our men, and toll them over. If once we get them into a right
                              sharp fight, they'll follow us across the river fast enough.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6021">“I have no doubt of their coming to look for us,” said Douglas,
                              “and no doubt of a fight; but we must be prepared to meet more men
                              than we have bargained for. Depend upon it, they will bring every
                              man they can raise. Why, would you believe it, the fellow talked to
                              me about living at home on codfish, and potatoes, and cider, and pies,
                              and 
                              <hi id="d2e6023" style="font-style: italic;">all sorts of sass</hi>? Such a simpleton could not impose on a child.
                              Col. Mason has talents worthy of a better cause, and he will see through
                              the whole affair. I suppose he is superseded; but he is an honorable
                              man, and will frankly give the benefit of his suspicions to his superior,
                              who can hardly be such a fool as to disregard his suggestions. We
                              must bestir ourselves, therefore, or give up the game and escape from
                              our own plot.

                           <p id="d2e6029">“Gentlemen,” continued Douglas, speaking aloud, and in a sustained
                              and decisive tone, “this is our place of rendezvous; the time mid-day
                              on the third of November. Every man must come prepared for action,
                              and such as mean to accompany me to the lower country, must bring 
                              with them all their necessaries. Mr. Gordon, I must depend on you
                              to hold this pass, and keep the enemy from crossing the river. I shall
                              send a force to support you, if necessary. You, Schwartz, know what
                              to do better than I can tell you. You, Witt, will return with me, and
                              we will talk, as we ride, of what is to be done. Mr. Gordon, 
                              <hi id="d2e6031" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> could
                              travel without food, but our horses cannot. We must trouble you for
                              something for all, and then we part until the day of rendezvous. Until
                              that time, ‘Vigilance and Activity’ is the word—but then ‘FREEDOM,
                              INDEPENDENCE, and GLORY.’”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6035">As Douglas said this they arrived at Mr. Gordon's door. The ready
                              meal was hastily swallowed, the horses fed, and they departed for the
                              camp. On the way Schwartz, turning to the left, kept a southward
                              course through the district, along the foot of the mountains, to rouse
                              the inhabitants in that quarter, and to collect a party to support Mr.
                              Gordon. The rest returned to the camp, from whence runners were
                              despatched throughout all the adjacent country, and even beyond the
                              mountain to the head-waters of the Holston. Leaving them thus employed,
                              let us repair to the head-quarters of the enemy.

                           <p id="d2e6038">In the handsome parlor of a handsome house, in the suburbs of
                              Lynchburg, we find two officers seated at a game of piquet. The hour
                              is nine at night. The room is richly furnished. A bright fire burns
                              on the hearth, and the blaze of sconce and astral lamps sheds its
                              soft, luxurious, moonlight beams into every corner. Wine, cordials,
                              fruits, and cigars are placed on a table, and every thing betokens comfort
                              and luxury, ease and indolence. The dress of these officers corresponds
                              with the scene. Both glitter with gold and flutter in lace,
                              and their richly mounted swords and highly finished pistols, which lie
                              on the table, show that the owners abound in the means of display and
                              self-indulgence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6042">Such was indeed the fact. The pay of the army, gradually increased
                              by law during thirty years, had grown to a noble revenue. The
                              
                              <hi id="d2e6044" style="font-style: italic;">emoluments</hi>, as they are called, under a system of fraud and connivance,
                              had advanced (
                              <hi id="d2e6047" style="font-style: italic;">without law</hi>) yet more rapidly; so that to be a Colonel
                              in the army of the United States was to be a rich man. Such was
                              the rank of both these officers. It was true that the treasury had
                              already begun to feel the drain of the vast sums accumulated under an
                              iniquitous tariff, and now employed to fortify the tyranny that had
                              enforced that pernicious system. The loss of the southern trade gave
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6050"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="185" data-tei-n="178"> </a></span>
                              reason to fear that the supply now on hand, if once exhausted, would
                              not be speedily renewed. But the rulers felt but the more sensibly
                              that the energetic employment both of force and corruption was necessary
                              to retain the little that remained, by holding Virginia in subjection.
                              With this view, the same system of wasteful expenditure, commenced
                              twenty years before, was kept up; and all who served the
                              crown with becoming zeal were encouraged to hold open their mouths
                              that they might be filled.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6053">In another part of the room a company of subalterns fluttered around
                              a bevy of fair damsels. To these young ladies the mistress of this
                              mansion had of late become an object of much increased regard. No
                              friend was so dear, no society so desirable, nor house so pleasant
                              to visit at as hers. Many an extra visit did she receive, since the
                              abounding loyalty of her husband had invited the commandant of the post to
                              make it his head-quarters. Many a wistful glance had been cast during
                              the evening, from the assiduous subalterns, toward the handsome and
                              unheeding wearer of two epaulettes, to whose authority all who approached
                              him were bound to bow. But it was all in vain. Sufficient
                              to himself, he valued not the admiring eyes which were bent upon
                              him; or if they occupied any thing of his attention, it was to be made
                              the subject of invidious comparison with the ladies of the highest
                              fashion in the northern cities, whose lavish attentions had rendered
                              him totally heedless of the vulgar admiration of a parcel of half-bred
                              Virginia girls.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6056">These remarks, however, apply to only one of the officers in question.
                              The other manifested no such insensibility, though his attentions
                              to the fair were only marked by a staid courtesy, hardly more flattering
                              than the perfect indifference of his companion. Still he paid such
                              attention as it becomes a gentleman to pay to every thing that wears
                              the exterior of a lady. But the day when he was himself an object
                              of court to them was past. Indeed, the ladies had already begun to
                              despair of thawing the coldness of his temperament, when, being
                              superseded by a younger and handsomer commander, he was laid on the
                              shelf and condemned as quite

                           <p id="d2e6068">The reader, without doubt, already understands that, of the two officers
                              before us, the elder in years, though the younger in commission, is
                              Col. Mason, late commandant of the post. His companion is Col.
                              Owen Trevor, whose impatience for distinction has been indulged by
                              sending him to Lynchburg with his regiment. Here, taking rank of
                              Mason, he has been in fact placed in command of a brigade, with an
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6070"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="186" data-tei-n="179"> </a></span>
                              understanding that time and opportunity will be afforded him to show
                              himself qualified for the rank, by discharging the functions of a
                              brigadier. This post has been assigned him because in this direction is the
                              only enemy actually in arms.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6073">Although the force under the command of Douglas had been originally
                              but a handful, Mason had seen that it possessed, in a marvellous
                              degree, the faculty of occasional expansion. His intelligence had
                              taught him to expect that it would ere long be greatly increased, if not
                              crushed by a vigorous movement on his part. Hence he was desirous
                              of acting on the offensive, especially as he had no doubt, from the
                              past, that Lynchburg was the object of Douglas. But he had seen
                              enough of the character and resources of his enemy to know that a
                              small force would be unavailing, and had therefore earnestly desired to
                              be reinforced. In answer to this request he had received, not the
                              moderate aid that he had desired, but an order to surrender his command
                              to Col. Trevor, whose well-appointed regiment was ordered to the
                              post.

                           <p id="d2e6077">Col. Mason was a man of honor and talent. He was one of the
                              many subjects of that strong delusion which had so extensively prevailed;
                              and, under the influence of which, Virginia, for thirty years,
                              had been sacrificing the 
                              <hi id="d2e6079" style="font-style: italic;">substance</hi> of liberty and prosperity to the
                              
                              <hi id="d2e6082" style="font-style: italic;">forms</hi> of a constitution devised to secure, but perverted to destroy
                              them. He belonged, moreover to that unfortunate class of partisans
                              whom it is safe to neglect. Acting on 
                              <hi id="d2e6085" style="font-style: italic;">principles</hi>, however erroneous,
                              it was clearly seen that these alone were sufficient to bind him to the
                              service to which he had devoted himself. It was at the same time
                              little doubted that a change of opinions would be followed by a 
                              renunciation of all the advantages of his situation, whatever they might be.
                              To waste on such a man the means of corrupting the corruptible, and
                              securing the faithless, would indeed have been “ridiculous excess.”
                              He had won his way to his present rank by the strict performance of
                              every duty of the subordinate offices, through which he had risen by
                              regular gradation. In the shuffling and cutting of the military pack,
                              he had seen junior officers placed above him by that sort of legerdemain
                              which had so long before procured his master the name of the
                              magician. He had not indeed acquiesced tamely in this, but means
                              had been always found so soothe him, and he had been retained in the
                              service by dextrous appeals to that magnanimity which they who knew
                              not how to appreciate, yet knew well how to play upon.

                           <p id="d2e6089">But he had not yet forgotten how, ten-years before, some pretext
                              had been found for reversing the relative rank of himself and Col.

                              had been devised to reconcile him to that which gave the rank of
                              Captain to one, whom he, still a Lieutenant, had once commanded.
                              Having repressed his dissatisfaction at that time, he now felt bound to
                              acquiesce in the circumstances which placed his former subordinate
                              immediately in authority over him. If this occurrence made him
                              repent his former tameness, now when it was too late to remonstrate,
                              he did not say so, but addressed himself with grave precision to the
                              fulfilment of all his commander's orders.

                           <p id="d2e6114">COLONEL TREVOR was the spoiled child of fortune and patronage.
                              He was old enough to remember his father's rise in life. Hence, in
                              estimating his consequence in society, he had formed a habit of comparing
                              him with the class from which he sprung, and not with that
                              more intellectual order of men, in which he had at last found his
                              proper place, and where he had long remained stationary in well
                              ascertained equality. This circumstance alone made an important difference
                              between him and his younger brothers. The sort of respect with

                           <p id="d2e6120">In the commencement of Col. Trevor's military career, the approbation
                              of his father had been of more consequence to the usurper than
                              now, when his throne stood strong on its foundations. The character
                              of that worthy gentleman, too, had been less understood. The President
                              had not been aware how absolutely the convictions of his own
                              mind and high sense of duty supplied the place of those 
                              <foreign id="d2e6122" xml:lang="fre">douceurs</foreign>, the
                              frequent repetition and continued expectation of which is necessary to
                              bind the faith of the unprincipled. Before this discovery was made,
                              Col. Trevor had been already advanced to a rank, and invested with an
                              adventitious consequence, which made it important to cultivate him on
                              his own account. His early training had taught him the grand maxim
                              of the court—“Nothing ask, nothing have.” He had discovered that
                              any display of fixed principle, however favorable to the usurper's plans,
                              was no passport to advancement; that rewards were only for the mercenary,
                              and that they were always dispensed with a freedom duly proportioned
                              to the eagerness with which they were sought. The caustic
                              wit of John Randolph had unintentionally and almost with his last
                              breath supplied the faction with a countersign not to be mistaken. If
                              any man talked about his principles, (as all men do and must at times,)
                              there was always at hand some dextrous pimp, whose business it was to
                              ascertain their number. If they were found to be either more or less
                              than seven, the discovery was fatal to his hopes of advancement.

                           <p id="d2e6127">The character of Douglas Trevor had been formed under circumstances
                              directly the reverse of those which had operated on his elder
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6129"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="189" data-tei-n="182"> </a></span>
                              brother. He only remembered his father in the same circles and the
                              same place in society in which his latter days had been spent. No
                              change of condition had led the youth to turn his back on the companions
                              of his boyhood; no rapid promotion had filled him with a fond conceit
                              of his own consequence, or an overweening eagerness for rank and
                              emolument; and his unbought fidelity had shown that he was of the
                              number of those on whom rewards would be wasted. Thus it happened,
                              (as it so often does,) that two young men, sons of the same parents,
                              educated in the same school, and trained to the same profession, were
                              just the reverse of each other, in particulars wherein nature had probably
                              made little difference between them. So it was, that while the
                              one was indifferent to duty, frivolous, self-indulgent, and mercenary,
                              the other was assiduous, discreet, temperate, and disinterested.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6132">It may be inferred from what I have said, that the rank of Col.
                              Trevor was already above his merit. The consequence was, that having
                              reached his present elevation by the force of causes not within himself,
                              his own consciousness afforded no standard for his farther pretensions.
                              He could see no reason why he should not be a field-marshal
                              as well as a colonel. And so it was; for he had no just claims to either
                              rank on the score of service or qualification. A stone thrown up, were
                              it endued with consciousness and thought, could see no reason, as long
                              as it was ascending, why it might not fly to the moon. If my experience
                              in life has taught me any thing, it is, that a man who sets no
                              bounds to his aspirations, unless his daily intercourse with the world
                              affords daily proofs of an intrinsic superiority over all he meets, is
                              already raised above his merit.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6135">The gentlemen, of whom I have been speaking, were busily engaged
                              in their game, when the Orderly in waiting entered and announced
                              an officer who wished to report himself to the commandant of the post.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6138">“Let him call in the morning, and be damned to him,” said Colonel
                              Trevor. “Is this an hour to disturb a gentleman?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6141">The Orderly saluted and withdrew, but presently returned to say that
                              the officer had particular business with Colonel Mason, and wished to
                              see him immediately. Mason accordingly left the room, and was gone
                              but a few minutes, when he too came back.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6144">“This officer, sir,” said he, “asked to see me, supposing me still in
                              command here. His intelligence is for you; and, from what I heard
                              before I discovered his mistake, it may be important that you should
                              receive it to-night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6148">“Well,” said Trevor, in a tone at once lazy and peevish, “I suppose
                              I must see him. But it is damned hard that I cannot have a moment's
                              leisure. Let him come in.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e6153">He was summoned accordingly, and proved to be no other than our
                              acquaintance, the Yankee spy, whom I now introduce to the reader, as
                              he announced himself. He is Captain Amos Cottle, of the 20th regiment
                              of infantry, in the army of the United States. His name, I
                              presume, (like that of the fourteen James Thomsons, in Don Juan,) had
                              been bestowed in honor of the illustrious bard immortalized by Lord
                              Byron. He was invited to take a glass of wine, and, having seated
                              himself, requested a private conference with the commanding officer.
                              This was a signal for the dispersion of the ladies, and their assiduous
                              attendants, who adjourned to another room. Mason was about to follow,
                              but the Colonel carelessly requested him to remain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6156">Captain Cottle was then invited to open his budget, which he did by
                              telling what the reader already knows. Not a sentence did he utter,
                              in which some indication of folly, vanity, or indiscretion did not escape
                              him. All this, however, passed unmarked of Col. Trevor, whose eyes
                              sparkled at the welcome intelligence. Nothing could be more apropos
                              to his wishes, or to the plan of the President. “
                              <foreign id="d2e6158" xml:lang="lat">Veni, vidi, vici.</foreign>”
                              The exploit of Caesar was the only parallel to that which he proposed
                              to achieve. Occasionally he looked to Mason for sympathy and concurrence
                              with his unexpressed thoughts. As often he withdrew his
                              eye, chilled and perplexed by the cold, steady, thoughtful look of his
                              companion. What could this mean? Could Mason be insensible to
                              the advantage the plot, or indifferent to its issue? Could envy so
                              far prevail with a man heretofore distinguished by his disinterested
                              zeal for the service, as to damp his ardor in an enterprise of so much
                              promise? He was at first indignant at this idea, but a little reflection
                              made him judge his brother-officer with more candor.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6162">“Poor Mason,” said he to himself. “I don't wonder that he is a
                              little mortified at my good fortune. It is something hard that he should
                              have held this post so long, without a chance to do any thing, and that
                              I should have come just in time to rob him of this. But then, damn
                              it! it is his own fault. What did he want with a reinforcement against
                              a parcel of ragged militia? It was right to supersede an officer who
                              would ask more than one regiment to meet any number of such ragamuffins
                              that could come against him. Besides, he ought to have broken
                              up their den long ago. If Douglas escapes me this time, it shall
                              not be long before I smoke him out of his hole, or there is no virtue in
                              gun-powder.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6165">Having thus reasoned himself into a state of exquisite self-complacency,
                              he heard the story of Captain Cottle to the end, and then asked
                              the opinion of Mason.

                           <p id="d2e6171">“I cannot say,” replied that gentleman, “that I am prepared to give
                              an opinion.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6174">“I hope,” said Trevor, “that you don't mean to deny me the benefit
                              of your thoughts.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6177">“So far from it, that I make it a point of conscience not to speak
                              without having first thought. When I have done so, I will tell you
                              what I think. To speak now would be but to give you the crude suggestions
                              of unreflecting and impertinent presumption.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6180">“I cannot understand,” said Trevor, “how you can require time to
                              think in so plain a case.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6183">“I might say, in reply,” answered Mason, “that as the case is so
                              clear to you, you can hardly need my advice. Indeed, I understand
                              your request of it but as a compliment to which I am not insensible,
                              and which I shall not decline. When I am prepared to speak, therefore,
                              I shall speak as plainly as if the case were as full of difficulty to
                              you as it is to me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6187">Having said this, Mason drew Cottle into conversation; enquired the
                              particulars of his visit to the mountain; encouraged him to recite his
                              conversations with Douglas; and, filling him full of vanity and conceit
                              by his deferential deportment, made the light shine through him, so as
                              to expose his folly to the most careless observer. At length he was
                              dismissed for the night, and Mason, addressing Trevor, said: “I am
                              now ready to give you my thoughts. I could not do so in Captain Cottle's
                              presence; and, indeed, my mind was not clear until I had some
                              more conversation with him. I am now satisfied.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6190">“Let's hear, then, the result of your cogitations,” asked Trevor, with
                              something of a sneer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6193">Mason colored slightly, but said, in a calm tone: “I have had some
                              experience of this Captain Douglas, and am morally sure he has not been
                              deceived by this man, as he supposes.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6196">“What!” exclaimed Trevor. “Do you forget that Captain Cottle is
                              an officer whose rank is a pledge for his honor, and who would forfeit
                              his commission and his life by bringing false intelligence to his commander?”

                              The man is palpably a Yankee—”

                           <p id="d2e6202">“And the cunning of the Yankee is proverbial,” interrupted Trevor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6206">“It is indeed”, replied Mason; “but as he is not only a Yankee,
                              but obviously so, he could not have made Douglas believe that he was
                              an influential inhabitant of Bedford, a native of the county, and a
                              zealous stickler for the sovereignty of Virginia.”

                           <p id="d2e6214">“And not without reason,” said Mason. “His plans, and his manner
                              of conducting them, all show it. His intelligence appears to be
                              always correct and ready, and his devices for the concealment of his
                              own schemes are commonly impenetrable. It is clear, from many circumstances,
                              that he has agents who pass through the country unsuspected;
                              and I should not be surprised if Cottle had fallen in with one
                              of them. I have no doubt that Douglas will be found at Jones's Ford
                              on the day appointed; but my life upon it, instead of coming there to
                              be surprised, he proposes to come there to surprise you.”

                           <p id="d2e6223">“I have no apprehension that he will surprise you,” said Mason,
                              “because I am sure you will take all proper precaution. I merely
                              mean to say that he will attempt it.”

                              I must use it, to be sure, superfluous as it may be against a set
                              of inexperienced militia.”

                           <p id="d2e6230">“Of one sort of experience,” said Mason, “and that not the least
                              important, they have had more than we. They have tasted danger
                              more than once; and their skill in the use of the rifle is such as men
                              who live with the weapon in their hands, and they alone, can be expected
                              to acquire.”

                           <p id="d2e6233">“I hope to bring in some of them as prisoners,” said Trevor, “and
                              then we shall see how that is. I will pit a dozen of our sharp-shooters
                              against a dozen of them, my horse to yours.”

                           <p id="d2e6236">“I am not in the habit of betting,” replied Mason, smiling quietly;
                              “but, in this case, I dare say I may do it innocently, as the offence will
                              hardly reach beyond intention; so I take your bet.”

                           <p id="d2e6239">“How do you mean?” asked Trevor, sharply.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6242">“I mean,” said Mason, “that I am not very sure that you will take
                              a dozen of them.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6246">“Not sure!” exclaimed Trevor; “how can they escape me?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6249">“I don't profess to understand their craft,” said Mason; “but they
                              are hard to catch. In short, Colonel Trevor, my instructions require
                              me to afford you all the information I have acquired here. It is therefore
                              my duty, even without question from you, to assure you that you
                              are in the midst of a disaffected country, and that you are going against
                              an enemy not to be despised, and among a people universally hostile.
                              Knowing those things, and invited by you to advise what is to be done
                              in this affair, my advice is to march your whole disposable force to the
                              appointed place, using every precaution to guard against surprise. It
                              might be as well to anticipate Douglas, so far at least as to understand
                              the ground, and to occupy it before the day.”
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6252"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="193" data-tei-n="186"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6254">“And so he takes warning, and escapes me.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6257">“By no means. Cottle's scheme will have been made available so
                              far as to draw him down from the mountains. You neither need nor
                              desire any other advantage. But I see that I cannot easily make myself
                              understood, because our minds are occupied with different things.
                              You are thinking about the trap set for Douglas, and I am thinking
                              about the snare he has laid for you. Depend upon it, Colonel Trevor,
                              that the old story of catching a Tartar, may be illustrated by catching
                              Douglas among the river hills. He may be caught; and yet, neither
                              come away nor let you come. Observe,” continued Mason, “when I
                              inquired of this Captain Cottle about the nature of the ground at the
                              Ford, behold, he had not taken notice of it! but, on cross-examination,
                              by finding what he did not see, I am satisfied that there is no low
                              ground, nor cleared land at the place; that the hills come sheer down
                              to the river, and, by almost necessary consequence, that the road leads
                              through a deep defile. The choice of such a place confirms my suspicion
                              of Douglas's plan, and affords the means to counterwork it. If we
                              occupy the strong points of the ground, and he comes with only such a
                              body of men as Cottle expects, we take him without effusion of blood.
                              If he comes in force, our position will give us all the advantage he
                              seeks; and, trust me, in that case we shall have need of them.”

                              and emphasizing every word.

                           <p id="d2e6273">“Our discipline and experience are of little consequence,” said Mason,
                              “if we do not use them. One use of them is to know how to take
                              advantages.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6276">“Be it so,” said Trevor; “I shall seek none. A fair field and a
                              clear sky are all I ask; and I shall be careful to take no measure which
                              may alarm this mountain wolf, and drive him back to his den before I
                              can come up with him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6279">These words were hardly spoken when the Orderly announced that
                              a sergeant of dragoons had just returned from a scouting party with
                              important intelligence, and had come to make his report to the Colonel.
                              What this was the reader will infer, when told that he was the
                              noncommissioned officer on whom had devolved the command of the four
                              men who had escaped with him from Jones's Ford. His information
                              confirmed Mason's suspicions, and might have served as a damper to
                              the flattering anticipations of a man less sanguine than Colonel Trevor.
                              Its only effect on him was to sharpen his eagerness for the expected
                              rencontre. Yet the Sergeant, when questioned, frankly admitted that his
                              party had not been out-numbered. But it was clear that their design
                              had been, by some means, disclosed to Douglas; and his advantage had
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6281"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="194" data-tei-n="187"> </a></span>
                              been the result of judicious dispositions, and the skill of his men in
                              the use of that most terrible of all weapons.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6284">But all this abated nothing of Colonel Trevor's contempt for a foe
                              unskilled in the manual exercise, ignorant of the grand manoeuvres
                              and dressed in buckskin. Every attempt on the part of Col. Mason to
                              bring him to listen to reason proved fruitless. Indeed the conversation
                              occasionally took such a turn as to create a doubt in the mind of that
                              gentleman, whether to press his advice any farther might not make it
                              difficult to reconcile with his own self-respect the deference which he
                              knew to be due to his commander. He therefore determined to receive
                              and execute in silence all orders which might be given, and leave the
                              event to Providence.

                           <p id="d2e6316">FREED at length from his troublesome adviser, Col. Trevor was
                              left to the uninterrupted enjoyment of his anticipated triumph. He
                              seemed to tread on air, and, with a flashing eye, and spread nostrils, to
                              look forward to the glories, and snuff up the carnage of the expected
                              fight. Such was his impatience for the adventure, that, in the eagerness
                              of anticipation, he gave no thought to the necessary preparations.
                              It was enough to issue the customary order for the troops to be in
                              readiness for the march, with a supply of cartridges and rations suitable to
                              the expedition.

                           <p id="d2e6319">The third day of November at length arrived, and the troops took
                              up the line of march. As they issued in glittering rank from the barracks
                              above the town, the Colonel, proudly mounted on his stately
                              charger, posted himself in the gateway of the house, where he had
                              taken up his quarters, and received their passing salute. The portico
                              of the house was crowded with female figures; the windows were clustered
                              with fair faces; the noble oak-trees in the yard were hung with
                              garlands, in token of the loyalty of the household, and of anticipated
                              triumph in his assured victory. But the Colonel saw nothing of this.
                              His eye saw not the waving of handkerchiefs, his ear heard not the
                              cheering farewells issuing in tones ef music from rosy lips. He heard
                              only the spirit-stirring drum and clanging bugle; he saw nothing but
                              the stately steppings of his well-trained troops as they marched by;
                              and then, his eye, following them, dwelt with delight upon their
                              picturesque appearance as they wound along the slope of the hill, and
                              crossed Blackwater-bridge. Beyond this, imagination presented objects
                              of yet greater interest—the battle-field, the tumult of the strife,
                              the rout, the pursuit, the carnage, the vanquished leader led in chains
                              to the foot of the throne, the gracious smile of approving majesty, and
                              the rich rewards of successful valor. These things he saw; but saw
                              not the gaunt figure of his host, who stood near, his strong features
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6321"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="196" data-tei-n="189"> </a></span>
                              and manly person illy sorting with the abject part he condemned himself
                              to act. He sought in vain to catch the eye of the excited commander,
                              desirous, in his parting words, to convoy some expression of
                              loyalty and zeal. Colonel Trevor marked him not, and, as the rear of
                              the column was about to pass, put spurs to his horse, and galloped to
                              the front.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6325">At this point of my story, I must crave the indulgence of the
                              reader, while I introduce my humble self to his notice. A native of
                              South Carolina, and the heir of a goodly inheritance, which, during a
                              long minority, had been at nurse in the hands of an honest and prudent
                              guardian, I was just of age, the master of a handsome income,
                              and of a large sum of money in hand. Having a taste for in military
                              life, my guardian had procured me a situation in the military academy,
                              which had been established by the State, as a counterpoise to that
                              institution at which the Federal Government had taught so many of our
                              southern youths to whet their swords against the only sovereignty to
                              which they owed allegiance. My proficiency had been seen, and gave
                              entire satisfaction to my teachers. I had imbibed political opinions
                              which made me a zealous advocate for the rights of the
                              States, and a strenuous asserter of the unalienable independence of
                              South Carolina. When, in compliance with the request of Mr. B—,
                              enquiry had been made for a young man qualified and disposed to aid
                              young Trevor in his enterprise, I had been selected for that purpose.
                              I was invited to Columbia, made acquainted with the plans of the
                              insurgents in Virginia, and provided with letters to my future commander.
                              Journeying to Virginia by the route that he had pursued,
                              on the evening of the first day of November I entered the valley described
                              in the first chapter. I soon encountered a crowd of men, who
                              filled the road and the yard of a house contiguous to it. There were
                              wagons, horses, and arms; and the men, moving quietly but busily,
                              seemed all earnestly engaged in sonic important preparation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6328">I was presently stopped, courteously though peremptorily; and having
                              expressed a wish to see Captain Douglas, was conducted to the
                              house. There, pen in hand, and busily engaged in writing, sat a young
                              man of small stature and slight figure. Though quite handsome, there
                              was nothing remarkable in his features, but a bright gray eye, of calm,
                              thoughtful and searching expression, strongly contrasted with the dark
                              brown, curling hair that clustered over his brow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6331">Being accosted by my conductor, he raised his head—when I stepped
                              forward, and handed him my letters. He glanced hastily to the signature
                              of the first he opened, then read it leisurely, and looking at me
                              with a beaming countenance, extended his hand. “You are welcome,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6333"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="197" data-tei-n="190"> </a></span>
                              sir,” said he, “welcome to danger's hour. In the morning we march
                              on an expedition which may decide the fate of the campaign. My
                              engagements must excuse my seeming neglect of you this evening.
                              But let me make you known to your future comrades.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6336">Then turning to a fair haired youth, already known to the reader as
                              Arthur Trevor, he introduced him as his mother's son. I was then
                              made acquainted with Schwartz and Witt, and several others. Among
                              the number were a few young men from the lower counties, of good
                              families and education, who, in this crisis, had left their homes to
                              engage in this expedition. These, like their leader, had all learned to
                              accommodate themselves to the fashions of that wild country, and its
                              wilder climate, and especially to their own wild life. Each individual
                              was dressed, from top to toe in leather, no otherwise differing from the
                              dress of the rudest mountaineer, than in neatness, and a certain easy
                              grace, and air of fashion, which no dress can entirely conceal. In any
                              dress, in any company, under any circumstances, Douglas Trevor would
                              have been recognized as a gentleman.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6339">I hardly remember how I fared, or how I passed the night. As a
                              stranger, I presume somewhat better than most others; but I took
                              pains to show that I was content to eat what I could get, and to lodge
                              as I might.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6342">At daylight we were on the road. But little attention was paid to
                              order. No enemy was near, and nobody was inclined to desert. There
                              was therefore no necessity for harassing men and horses, by forcing
                              them to keep in ranks. Each man rode where, and with whom he
                              pleased, except that a few were directed to keep near the wagons, not
                              so much to guard as to assist in case of need  It is impossible to
                              conceive a military array with less of the “pomp and circumstance of
                              war.” The horses were, for the most part, substantial, and in substantial
                              order. Their equipments were of the rudest sort. Plough-bridles
                              and pack-saddles were most common. The only arms were the rifle,
                              knife, and tomahawk, with their appropriate accompaniments of
                              powder-horn, charger, and pouch. Douglas, indeed, had a sword, and the
                              few sabres taken from the dragoons had been distributed among the
                              principal men. But they were all too wise to encumber their persons with
                              these weapons, which might have been troublesome in their mode
                              of warfare. A strong loop of thick leather, stitched to the skirt
                              of the saddle, in front of the left knee, received the sword, the hilt of
                              which stood up above the pummel. Two or three of the saddles were
                              of the Spanish fashion, the horn of which served to support any trifle
                              the rider might wish to hang on it. Douglas, in particular, carried,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6344"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="198" data-tei-n="191"> </a></span>
                              in this way, a leather case, containing his writing materials, and
                              serving as a tablet for writing on horseback.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6348">But rude as these equipments were, yet to one acquainted with the
                              object of the expedition, there was an appearance of efficiency in the
                              whole which gave the corps a truly formidablo aspect. The perfect
                              order of the arms, the strong, though rude dress of the men, their
                              sinewy frames, their sun-burnt faces; and, above all, the serious and
                              resolved expression of countenance which generally prevailed, were
                              tokens which none but a martinet would overlook.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6351">As yet no duty had been assigned to me, so that I was perfectly
                              disengaged. It was not until we had rode several miles, that Douglas
                              found leisure to converse with me. He then joined me, accompanied
                              by Schwartz, to whom, in my presence, he explained my situation.
                              Schwartz heard him with thoughtful attention, and then said—“It is
                              all mighty well, sir, if Mr. Sidney will only just take it right. You
                              see, sir,” continued he, addressing me, “there an't no officers among
                              us, and we only just call the Captain so for short. If he was a Captain
                              or a Gineral it would not make much odds, because these fellows
                              just go for what is right and hard fighting; and him they believe in,
                              him they mind. But as to who is first and who is second, that's neither
                              here nor there. I have not a doubt that you are the sort of a man
                              we want; but all that we can do, is to give you a fair chance to let the
                              men see it. The Captain can be asking your advice, now and then,
                              and I and Witt will do the same, and when they see that, they will
                              begin to find out what you are. And then, you see, sir, when once we
                              get to fighting, a man is never in such a flurry himself, but what he
                              can see who knows what he is about, and who does not. So, by the
                              time we have had a skrimmage or two, the men will know all about
                              you; and whenever the Captain is out of the way, they will all be looking
                              to you to know what to do; just in the way of giving your
                              
                              <hi id="d2e6353" style="font-style: italic;">opinion</hi>, mind; but, 
                              <hi id="d2e6356" style="font-style: italic;">after a while</hi>, it will get to be 
                              <hi id="d2e6359" style="font-style: italic;">orders</hi>. And then,
                              if any thing happens to the Captain, and Witt and I don't see cause
                              to change our mind, why, we only just have to follow you, and the
                              men they follow us, and all will go straight. So you must just make
                              yourself easy and keep quiet. We'll tell you when to speak, and
                              after a while you'll find yourself second in command before you know
                              it.”

                           <p id="d2e6363">I had no difficulty in acknowledging the reasonableness of these
                              ideas, though it seemed a new thing to find a man possessing the
                              influence and authority of Schwartz, devising means to transfer them to
                              another. But he knew, and the event showed that he was right, that
                              there were some duties of a commander for which he was not fit; and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6365"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="199" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span>
                              that there were other things to which a chief could not devote himself,
                              for which he was better qualified than any other.

                           <p id="d2e6368">On the third of November we reached the rendezvous, at the house
                              of Mr. Gordon. On the way we had received frequent accessions of
                              strength, and here we were joined by a yet larger reinforcement. Our
                              whole number could not have been much, if at all, short of a thousand
                              men.

                           <p id="d2e6371">Meantime scouts came in, from whom we learned that the same day
                              had been fixed for the march of the troops from Lynchburg. It followed
                              that we had abundance of time for our preparations. It so happened,
                              that they had not learned the name of the new commander;
                              but it was understood that a reinforcement had arrived, and that nearly
                              the whole disposable force was on the march. This included a troop
                              of dragoons and a company of artillery, with two pieces of cannon, in
                              addition to a full regiment of infantry, and one battalion of another.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6374">Having ascertained his force, and fixed on those on whom he could
                              rely to understand and execute his plans, Douglas proceeded to make a
                              temporary organization, suited to the occasion. The men were divided
                              into corps, to each of which a post was provisionally assigned, to be
                              occupied as soon as the approach of the enemy should be announced.
                              Across the road, near the head of the defile, and just above the first
                              angle next the top of the ascent, was constructed a barricade of logs,
                              similar to those already described. This reached, on each side, to the
                              foot of the hills, at steep, rocky, and impracticable points. It was
                              long enough for twenty men to man its twenty loop-holes, and as it
                              reached above their heads, they were quite concealed. An hundred
                              men were allotted to this post, who were ranged five deep behind the
                              barricade, and instructed to fire in turn, each man falling back to the
                              rear to reload as soon as he had discharged his piece.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6378">Others were distributed along the opposite faces of the hills over-looking
                              the road, and directed to seek out hiding-places behind rocks,
                              trees, and bushes. These men were under the immediate orders of
                              individuals selected for the occasion, but attached to the command of
                              Witt, who was stationed at the barrier.

                           <p id="d2e6381">About a hundred were placed in ambush in the mouth of the ravine,
                              just below the road, on the north side of the river, under Schwartz.
                              These were all picked men—our steadiest and coolest sharp-shooters—
                              who were placed there for the purpose of attacking and carrying the
                              guns of the enemy at the water's edge.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6384">Douglas himself, at the head of the rest of his corps, prepared to
                              occupy the road on the north side of the river, to bring on the action.
                              These were divided into two equal bodies, and the whole ranged in
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6386"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="200" data-tei-n="193"> </a></span>
                              platoons, at open order, across the road. Of the two battalions, as they
                              may be called, the foremost was placed under my command. The
                              other Douglas commanded in person. My orders were to post my
                              headmost platoon just at the bend of the road, on the top of the hill
                              where it turns to the right. They were instructed to fire 
                              <foreign id="d2e6388" xml:lang="lat">ad limitum</foreign>,
                              each man choosing and making sure of his mark, and then to file away
                              by the right, and, taking to their heels, to run down to the river,
                              cross it, and dispose themselves on the other bank, so as most effectually to
                              gall the enemy, should he attempt to cross. Each platoon, in succession,
                              was to march up to the same ground, and, having fired, to execute
                              the same manoeuvre. The remaining column, under Douglas, were to
                              stand their ground until the enemy should come in view on the top of
                              the hill, and then to fall back fighting, and cross under cover of those
                              who should have passed before. But the best account of what was
                              ordered will be gathered from what was done.

                           <p id="d2e6425">WHILE these arrangements were in progress, scouts were hourly
                              arriving. The country being altogether friendly, they were readily
                              provided with fresh horses; and, before the enemy were half way
                              from Lynchburg, we were fully apprised of their number, equipments,
                              and order of march. First came a squadron of dragoons; then a light
                              company; then Trevor's regiment, about five hundred strong; then a
                              company of artillery; then one battalion of Mason's regiment,
                              consisting of something more than two hundred men; the whole followed
                              by a few light troops, by way of rear-guard. The whole might amount
                              to a thousand men, well appointed and prepared at all points for efficient
                              action.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6428">On the morning of the fifth of November the men were ordered to
                              betake themselves to their allotted posts; and Douglas, having visited
                              each, and seen that all was right, and rightly understood, addressed
                              himself to his particular command. Where every man is an officer,
                              each must be told individually beforehand what is expected from him.
                              Panic apart, they will be apt to fulfil such instructions, and will fight
                              with the terrible efficiency of individual animosity. Hence the formidable
                              character of partisan warfare.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6432">At length the enemy made their appearance. Clinging to the idea
                              of surprising Douglas, Col. Trevor sent forward no advance, but determined
                              to bring the whole strength of his corps to bear upon him at
                              once. If he employed any scouts, they were either unfaithful, or were
                              not permitted to approach near enough to learn any thing of the position
                              or movements of Douglas. The consequence was, that Col. Trevor
                              received the first intimation of his presence from a sharp firing in
                              front, which sent his horse to the right-about and back to the rear.
                              Pressing forward, he immediately ordered his sharp-shooters to disperse
                              and take positions to gall us, while he pushed on his solid column of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6434"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="195"> </a></span>
                              heavy infantry. The reception prepared for them was such as he had
                              not dreamed of. His men fell like leaves in autumn—and, as fast as
                              one platoon of the mountaineers discharged their pieces, another was
                              on the same ground to pour in again that terrible fire, of which the
                              martinets of the regular service have so inadequate an idea. Instead
                              of the deep-mouthed peal of muskets, discharged simultaneously, there
                              is the sharp, short crack of rifle after rifle, fired by men no one of
                              whom touches the trigger until he sees precisely where his ball is to
                              go. The effect was suitable to the cause; but yet the steady infantry
                              pressed on,
                              
                              <quote style=" display: inline; ">“Each stepping where his comrade stood,”</quote>
                              to form an unbroken front, in order to charge with the bayonet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6440">Suddenly the firing ceased, and, behold, their enemy seemed to
                              have fled from the expected charge. The fact was, that my last platoon,
                              having fired, had withdrawn like their predecessors, and were
                              running at full speed after their companions, down the hill and across
                              the river. At the water's edge, I stopped and joined Schwartz in his
                              ambush. It had been arranged that I should do this; because, in case
                              we should be so fortunate as to seize the cannon, my skill as an
                              artillerist might be of great use. Meantime, my men having crossed over,
                              dispersed themselves along the bank, the face of the hills, and across
                              the road, to cover the retreat of those who remained.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6443">The regulars had necessarily spent a few moments in repairing the
                              wreck of their shattered column before they advanced. They then
                              moved forward, but, before they turned the angle of the road, most of
                              my men were across the river. At the same time, the column under
                              the immediate command of Douglas was seen drawn up in the road,
                              near the foot of the hill, with the rear resting on the water's edge. As
                              the enemy advanced the front platoon fired, faced to the right, and
                              filing along the flank of the column, entered the river, and crossed just
                              below the ford. They next filed to the left in the same way, and
                              crossed above the ford. In this manner the whole column disappeared,
                              one platoon after another, while their fire was answered by a roar of
                              musketry, which, being discharged from the higher ground, did more
                              harm to those on the farther bank of the river than to the nearer enemy.
                              At length the last platoon was withdrawn, and the regulars
                              rushed down toward the river for the purpose of annoying them in
                              crossing. In this attempt they were again checked and driven back
                              by the terrible fire of my men, who, having already crossed, were
                              drawn up, as I have said, on the other bank.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d2e6448">Col. Trevor now saw the necessity of advancing his artillery, which
                              was accordingly hurried down to the water's edge to clear a passage for
                              the infantry. By the time the cannon were untimbered, not a man of
                              the mountaineers was to be seen. As soon as their companions had
                              crossed, they dispersed with every appearance of confusion and alarm;
                              some scampering along the road, and some clambering up the hills on
                              both sides of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6451">The way was now open, and the infantry advanced to cross the river.
                              At this moment Colonel Mason, riding up to Colonel Trevor, pointed
                              out the advantageous position of the artillery as a cover to his rear, if
                              he should be forced to retreat. “Give me leave to suggest,” said he,
                              “that it may be well to leave the cannon where they are. The cavalry,
                              too, cannot act with effect among those hills, and the two together,
                              should the fortune of the day be unpropitious, may be of more use
                              here than on the other side.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6455">“You say true,” said Trevor. “It shall be as you advise, and you,
                              Colonel, will remain in command of this reserve.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6458">“I earnestly beg, sir,” said Mason, “that you will not deny me a
                              share in the work of the day. The Captains of artillery and dragoons
                              are all-sufficient to the command of their respective corps.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6461">“Pardon me, sir,” said Trevor. “None can be so proper to execute
                              your prudent and cautious device as you, its author. You will be
                              pleased, therefore, to repair to the rear, rally the dragoons, and bring
                              them down to the water's edge. Let them be ready to cross at a moment's
                              warning, to assist in the pursuit as soon as I have driven the
                              enemy into the plain.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6464">Saying this, Colonel Trevor turned off, and giving the word to march,
                              dashed into the river. Poor Mason, insulted and mortified, nevertheless
                              patiently addressed himself to the duty assigned him. Thus was
                              this able and brave man denied all participation in an affair which his
                              arrogant and sanguine commander believed to be an abounding source
                              of honor to all who might be engaged in it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6467">I have omitted to mention that, as soon as the plan of endeavoring
                              to surprise the artillery had been adopted, Schwartz had requested me
                              to draw the outline of a piece of mounted ordnance in the sand, and
                              to mark the proper positions of the artillerists employed about it.
                              While I did this, some ten or fifteen of our best marksmen stood by,
                              looking on attentively. When my sketch was done, he turned to one
                              of them, and pointing to one of the marks made to stand for an artillerist,
                              said coolly: “Now, this is your man;” and to another, “this
                              is yours.” Thus he went on till he had doomed every victim.

                              please suppose that Col. Trevor's regiment have forded the river, and
                              have passed up the road and out of sight. It will be remembered that
                              the hills on both sides of the defile had been lined with concealed
                              marksmen, and that the greater part of the advance had, on recrossing
                              the river, thrown themselves into the same places of concealment. But
                              the idea that they had done so for any purpose but that of safety,
                              entered not into Col. Trevor's mind. Indeed, if he had had any doubt,
                              it must have been removed when he found, that as his column wound
                              through the deep defile, not a shot molested their march. At the first
                              angle of the road he halted and let the column march past him. He
                              could see, from this point, both the head of it, as it advanced, and the
                              rear as it came up. As the later passed the spot where he stood, the
                              leading platoon was in the act of turning the next angle of the road.
                              At that moment he heard the startling report of a volley of rifles. He
                              set spurs to his horse to gallop to the front, when every rock and every
                              tree of the surrounding hills burst into flame, and the deep ravine
                              echoed to the report of a hundred rifles. A shot struck his horse, and
                              another piercing his hat, grazed the top of his head deep enough to lay
                              bare the skull, and stun him as he fell under his slaughtered horse.
                              He was thus placed 
                              <hi id="d2e6474" style="font-style: italic;">

                              </hi>, owing the preservation of his life
                              to the insignia of his rank which had endangered it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6482">The sound of this firing was the signal for us. Each of the selected
                              marksmen fixed his aim on his appropriate victim; and, at a word
                              from Schwartz, the artillerymen at the guns fell as if swept away by the
                              breath of a tempest. Rushing from our hiding-place, the cannon were
                              instantly in our possession. The company of artillery were not slow to
                              disappear behind the angle of the rock, and one or two who peeped
                              out, being instantly picked off, we saw no more of them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6485">Presently we heard the heavy tramp of the squadron slowly descending
                              the hill, accompanied with the peculiar sound of dragoons, dressing
                              the front in preparation for a sudden and overwhelming charge. While
                              this was passing, our guns were all reloaded. “Mind, boys,” said 
                              Schwartz; “all of number one.” The word was understood, and
                              every alternate man stood ready, with rifle cocked and trigger set, to
                              receive the enemy. The charge was sounded, and the leading horsemen,
                              wheeling around the rock were rushing on at full speed, when
                              horses and riders were seen to go down in one promiscuous heap. The
                              greater number of the squadron were still out of sight; and, had the
                              way been open, might have followed to share the fate of their companions,
                              and finally to ride us down when our guns should have been
                              all discharged. But the work had been done too effectually. The
                              dead and wounded (both horse and rider) nearly filled the road; and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6487"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="205" data-tei-n="198"> </a></span>
                              for dragoons to pick their way among such appalling obstacles, in the
                              face of fifty loaded rifles, at a distance of twenty paces, was out of the
                              question. A few who made the attempt found this to their cost. The
                              charge was not renewed, and some of our men advancing to the angle
                              of the rock, and occupying inaccessible but commanding points on the
                              hills, soon made them draw off to a safe distance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6490">While this was doing, I, with the few men selected for the service
                              of the artillery, gave my attention to that. Glancing my eye along
                              both pieces, I saw that both had been accurately pointed into the road
                              on the other side. I had nothing, therefore to do but to apply the
                              port-fire, which was still burning in the clenched hand of a dead
                              artillerist. By this time the column had fallen back, and the road below
                              the first angle was fast filling with the retreating mass. I had never
                              before witnessed the effusion of blood; and, heated as mine now was,
                              it ran cold as I applied the match. As the smoke cleared off, I saw
                              the enemy throwing away their arms, and stretching out their hands,
                              some toward me, and some aloft to the unseen foe that galled them
                              from the hills. The fire instantly slackened, and cravats and
                              handkerchiefs being raised on the points of swords and bayonets, it ceased
                              altogether. The mountaineers now poured down from the hills into the
                              ravine, securing the arms of the enemy, mixing among them and hemming
                              them in on every side. Douglas, whose place since he had recrossed
                              the river, had been among these concealed marksmen, was one
                              of the first to approach the enemy. Advancing to those whose rank
                              was most conspicuous, he made known his authority, and received their
                              swords.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6493">Meantime Col. Trevor had recovered his senses, and found himself
                              fastened to the ground by the weight of his horse, which lay upon his
                              leg. He was presently discovered, relieved, and helped to rise. At
                              this moment he caught the eye of Douglas, who hastened to him, less
                              from impatience to demand his sword than to offer assistance to one
                              who seemed to be an officer of high rank, and badly wounded. In the
                              figure before him, all smeared with blood and dirt, he saw nothing by
                              which he could recognize his brother. To the Colonel, the disguise of
                              Douglas was hardly less complete. He had seen him receiving the
                              surrender of others, and stood prepared to go through the same humiliating
                              ceremony. He felt that his own disgrace was complete, and the
                              form of surrender was thought of with indifference. He had already
                              reached the lowest depth of abasement.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6496">“But in that lowest depth a lower deep” seemed to open, when, as
                              he extended his hand to deliver his sword to the victor, he discovered
                              that the hand put forth to receive it was that of Douglas. He flung
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6498"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="206" data-tei-n="199"> </a></span>
                              down his sword, stamping with rage, and immediately after called to
                              his men to resume their arms. The voice struck the ear of Douglas,
                              though dissonant with passion. The figure, too, confirmed his suspicion
                              of the truth; and he immediately rushed to screen his brother with
                              his own body from the rifles pointed against him. Calling for aid to
                              those around, he presently succeeded in securing the Colonel, and after
                              one or two fruitless attempts to soothe him, ordered him away to the
                              house of Mr. Gordon. To that gentleman he spoke aside, and explaining
                              in confidence the strange scene that he had just witnessed,
                              besought him to take command of the escort, and to pay all imaginable
                              attention to the health, comfort, and feelings of the Colonel. He was
                              accordingly led away, raging and foaming at the mouth like a spoiled
                              child who has been deprived of his toy, or baulked in his amusement.
                              The mortification of Douglas was extreme; but he had the satisfaction
                              to find that Arthur was not present; and to no other person but
                              Schwartz and myself did the name of Colonel Trevor afford a hint of
                              the connexion.

                           <p id="d2e6543">I SHALL not detain the reader with a detail of the farther particulars
                              of this skirmish. Indeed we hardly staid to acquaint ourselves with
                              its exact results. As at least half the men who had fought under
                              Douglas on that day had no intention to follow him any farther, we left
                              to them the care of the killed, wounded, and prisoners. The body
                              of Col. Mason alone was selected for a more honorable burial than the
                              rude hands of the mountaineers could bestow. It was dragged from
                              beneath the incumbent mass of men and horses, placed on a suitable
                              carriage, covered with the colors of his regiment, and taken to Lynchburg,
                              to be there restored to his companions in arms. The band of
                              his regiment were also marched to that place to assist in rendering the
                              last honors to their late commander.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6546">Having given the necessary orders, Douglas snatched a moment to
                              ride to Mr. Gordon's, where he hoped to find his brother in a more
                              reasonable mood. The Colonel had been confined in a private room;
                              and being treated with great courtesy and respect, had lost nothing of
                              his arrogance. Such is always the effect of delicate attention to the
                              undeserving. A man of merit would have been softened and melted
                              by the deference with which. Colonel Trevor was treated. To him it
                              seemed but that sort of spontaneous homage to greatness which the
                              heart pays unconsciously. The effect of it was, that being told by Mr.
                              Gordon that his brother had come to visit him in his room, he sent
                              him the following magnanimous note, pencilled on the back of a letter:

                              at once savage and coldly selfish. But he had no time to waste in
                              parleying with the ungoverned passions of his brother, and wrote an
                              answer in these words:

                           <p id="d2e6585">While Douglas was engaged in this painful duty, Arthur was employed
                              in preparing a formal report of the events of the day. This
                              was signed by the Chief on his return, and with it the young man was
                              despatched to B—, with instructions to ask his orders, and return with
                              them, unless another messenger should be preferred. In the meantime
                              all things had been made ready for the march to Lynchburg. I
                              shall not give the history of this. It was triumphal, as far as complete
                              success and the applauding gratulations of the people could make it so.
                              We had no difficulty in adding to our numbers as many men as the
                              fruits of our victory enabled us to supply with arms. Some joined us
                              instantly, and others engaged to rendezvous at Lynchburg in a few
                              days.

                           <p id="d2e6588">There was nothing to damp the pleasure of Douglas, but the conduct
                              of his perverse brother, and the presence of the dead body of his old
                              friend, Colonel Mason. On our arrival before the camp at Lynchburg,
                              I received orders to present myself with a flag before the gate, at the
                              head of a detachment which escorted the body, accompanied by the
                              music of his band, and all the sad and imposing insignia of a military
                              funeral.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6592">An officer came out to meet us, and thus received the first authentic
                              history of the fate of the expedition. I was instructed to deliver over
                              the body of Colonel Mason with every circumstance of respect and
                              courtesy. I was also charged to demand the surrender of the entrenched
                              camp, and of the garrison as prisoners of war.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6595">A negotiation ensued, which ended in a suspension of arms for five
                              days, and an agreement to surrender if, in that time, no reinforcement
                              arrived.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6598">This arrangement was by no means unwelcome to Douglas. It gave
                              him time to receive and organize the new recruits that were pouring
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6600"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="209" data-tei-n="202"> </a></span>
                              in, and to await the return of Arthur. In the meantime much of that
                              sort of intercourse which is common on such occasions took place.
                              There are few things in life more pleasant than it is. There must be
                              less of malignity in human nature than is generally supposed, or men
                              would not seize, with so much eagerness, on opportunities to lose the
                              idea of public hostility in the kindly interchange of courtesy and good
                              offices. Friendships are never formed more suddenly and cordially than
                              under such circumstances. So we found it on this occasion. Major
                              Wood, the officer in command, was a gentleman and soldier, honorable,
                              frank, generous, and accomplished. I was brought much into contact
                              with him, and found him enthusiastic in his acknowledgments of the
                              merits of Douglas, and eager to become acquainted with him. But the
                              time had not come when he was willing to be known by his true name;
                              and besides that he was acquainted with the Major, there were many
                              others in the camp who would have recognized him. He therefore
                              confined himself to his quarters, on various pleas of business; and, to
                              make his seclusion effectual, took lodgings in a house in the suburbs of
                              the town. By his advice, I mixed much with the men; and, as I had
                              acquitted myself to their entire satisfaction in the late affair, I found
                              that I was in a fair way to be recognized as second in command.
                              Schwartz and Witt made a point of consulting me publicly on all occasions;
                              and this circumstance, together with my daily attention to the
                              organization of the troops, obtained me full credit for all my military
                              skill, and a great deal more.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6603">The five days passed away quite pleasantly. The regulars, finding
                              that they were not like to fall into the hands of savages, were becoming
                              reconciled to the fate which now seemed inevitable; and we parted
                              on the last night of the truce, with no unpleasant anticipations of the
                              surrender which was to take place the next day at noon.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6606">The morning came, and our men paraded in high spirits, and with
                              considerable show of order and discipline. This was particularly the
                              case with a small company which had been detailed for the service of
                              the artillery, who took their stand at the guns with the air of men
                              proud of their new acquirements. I had indeed taken great pains to
                              train and exercise them, and, by universal consent, was recognized as
                              the immediate commander of this corps, which was drawn up with the
                              cannon planted directly against the gate of the camp.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6609">All this time Douglas did not make his appearance. At length the
                              hour approached for the garrison to march out, and lay down their
                              arms, when Schwartz went to his quarters to receive his orders. He
                              soon returned, and taking me aside, told me that Douglas was not at
                              his quarters, and was nowhere to be seen.

                           <p id="d2e6615">We had already observed appearances in the camp not at all answerable
                              to the expected surrender, and I was now startled at this intelligence.
                              The character of Major Wood forbade indeed any suspicion of
                              foul play. But the time was near at hand when the enemy should
                              march out, and we heard nothing of their drums, calling the men to
                              parade. We determined, therefore, to send a flag to the camp on some
                              pretext. The officer who carried it was immediately warned off, and
                              having said that he had a communication for Major Wood, was told
                              that that officer was no longer in command, and that COL. TREVOR
                              would receive no communication from rebels and traitors.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6618">This was decisive. The quarters of Douglas were not very distant
                              from the enemy, and such had been the appearance of perfect good
                              faith in all their proceedings, that our camp had been guarded even
                              more negligently than is common with militia. It seemed, indeed, almost
                              incredible that Col. Trevor could have been guilty of an act of
                              base treachery against the life or liberty of his generous brother; but
                              to Schwartz and myself, who knew the connexion, even this seemed
                              hardly less extravagant than his former conduct. That he had escaped;
                              joined the troops, and disclaimed the capitulation entered into by
                              Major Wood, was certain. To have surprised and carried off Douglas
                              could not be much worse.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6621">We now consulted with Witt, to whom we communicated our suspicions,
                              at the same time disclosing the true name of our young commander,
                              and his relation to Col. Trevor. What was suspicion with us,
                              was at once absolute certainty with him. I do not think I ever witnessed
                              such a change as our communication made in the whole appearance
                              and demeanor of the man. Heretofore, I had always seen him
                              cool, cautious, deliberate, and thoughtful. There was, besides, a
                              prevailing tone of benevolence in all he said, which, added to his sobriety
                              and strong sense, gave him some claim to the title of philosopher. But
                              now the expression of his countenance was terrible and awful. He
                              had made no show of regard for Douglas; but his attachment was deep
                              and abiding, and his alarm for his safety was in the same degree. He
                              was impatient of a moment's delay, sternly protested against wasting
                              time in discussion, and insisted on immediately storming the camp.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6624">Schwartz was nothing behind him in zeal, though less disturbed by
                              passion; and we presently determined to bring matters to extremities.
                              As soon, therefore, as the hour appointed for surrender arrived, our
                              captive drummer was ordered to beat a parley. To this the only answer
                              was a general fire of musketry from the whole line of the camp on that
                              side, by which a few men were hurt. But the distance was too great
                              for any serious mischief. Enough, however, was done to excite the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6626"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="211" data-tei-n="204"> </a></span>
                              men to fury; and without waiting for the word, they rushed to the assault.
                              Their movement determined me. To rush up to the piqueted
                              entrenchment, behind which the enemy were in comparative safety,
                              was to expose themselves to destruction. It was indispensable to open
                              a way for them. This I effected by a discharge of both pieces of artillery,
                              which tore the gate away, and pointed their attack to this accessible
                              point. The moment after, Colonel Trevor, with his untractable
                              rashness, appeared in the gateway, shouting, and calling to his men to
                              sally forth against us. He was instantly recognized by the incensed
                              Witt, whose fatal aim brought him to the ground. His men fell back;
                              and in a moment after, a white flag was raised.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6629">It was no easy matter to prevail on our men to pay any regard to this
                              signal; but we succeeded in restraining them before it was too late.
                              Of course we demanded the instant surrender of the place, which was
                              unhesitatingly given up. Major Wood now came forward to apologize
                              and explain. Col. Trevor, having made his escape, had returned to the
                              camp soon after tattoo. His whole behavior was that of a man beside
                              himself, and actuated by some inscrutable motive to some inscrutable
                              purpose. Of these he said nothing to his officers, but peremptorily
                              disclaiming the capitulation, gave orders that all things should be prepared
                              for a renewal of hostilities the next morning. Nothing more
                              was known but that he had summoned to his quarters a favorite sergeant
                              of his own regiment, who had been left sick in camp when be marched
                              against Douglas. This sergeant and four soldiers, as it seemed from
                              the morning report, had disappeared in the night.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6633">Major Wood assured us, that all that had been since done had taken
                              place under the immediate orders and superintendence of Colonel Trevor,
                              and in spite of his own most earnest remonstrances. In proof of
                              his sincerity, he appealed to the fact of his unconditional surrender the
                              moment he was apprised of the fall of the Colonel. With all this I
                              was perfectly satisfied, and gladly returned him his sword, with a proper
                              acknowledgment of his gentlemanly conduct.

                           <p id="d2e6636">“And now, Major,” said Schwartz, “there is another matter we
                              want to talk to you about. Do you know any thing of our Captain?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6639">“Of Captain Douglas?” said the Major. “Certainly not. But I
                              hope I may now have the pleasure of seeing him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6642">“Look here, Major,” said Witt, whose eye still glared with ferocity
                              not at all abated by the fall of Trevor; “that a'nt the thing; and we
                              want a straight answer. Captain Douglas is missing, and we want to
                              know what's become of him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6645">“Missing!” said the Major, with unfeigned amazement. “I assure
                              you, upon my honor, I know nothing of him.”

                              Schwartz.

                           <p id="d2e6654">“None that I can imagine,” was the reply.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6657">“Is there not a Captain here,” asked Schwartz; “a red-headed fellow,
                              that commands the company at Farmville?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6660">“Captain Cottle? Yes.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6663">“Well, I want to see him.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6666">He was immediately summoned, and presently made his reluctant
                              appearance. His alarm increased on seeing Schwartz and Witt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6670">“See here, Mister,” said the former; “here is a piece of villainy
                              that we want to know about; and there is nobody, I reckon, so apt to
                              tell us as you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6673">“Indeed, sir,” said Cottle, “I declare, sir, I don't know a word
                              about it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6676">“You don't, eh!” said Schwartz. “Well, any how, you are mighty
                              quick to 
                              <hi id="d2e6678" style="font-style: italic;">find out</hi> that you don't know; that I must say for you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6682">“Did you ever see me before?” said Witt, fixing his terrible eye on
                              the alarmed Captain. “Did you ever see me before?” repeated he.
                              “Do you remember where it was? Do you remember your business
                              there; and did you ever hear of such a thing as a man being hung for
                              a spy?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6685">The collapse of deadly terror came over Cottle at these dreadful
                              words. His face, already pale, became livid; his eye no longer
                              blenched under the fearful glance of Witt; but the lids opened as if by
                              mutual repulsion, while his lip and under jaw fell powerless. He was
                              roused from this state by Schwartz, who asked him what had become of
                              Captain Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6688">He was now effectually scared out of all thought of concealment,
                              and answered without prevarication that Captain Douglas had been
                              surprised, during the night, by the order of Col. Trevor, and sent away
                              immediately under the guard of a sergeant and four men, across the
                              river. He could not say, certainly, where he was gone; but he
                              suspected to Washington, as Col. Trevor appeared to have been writing
                              busily all the time the party were engaged in the capture of Douglas.
                              It was vain to attempt concealing that he had a hand in this, though
                              the disclosure was made with great reluctance. It appeared, moreover,
                              that he had been anxious to accompany the prisoner, supposing him to
                              be ordered for Washington; but Col. Trevor had refused to send him.
                              Indeed, he sent none but those who had not been engaged in the action
                              at the ford, and was certainly right not to trust the vain babbler, whose
                              idle garrulity could hardly have failed to rub off any gloss he might
                              have thought fit to spread over the affair.

                           <p id="d2e6694">“How did they get across the river?” asked Schwartz. “We have
                              a strong guard on the other side, and they had orders to keep a strict
                              watch.”

                           <p id="d2e6697">“Col. Trevor told the sergeant,” replied Cottle, “just to float quietly
                              down the river and land away below; and a handkerchief was tied
                              over the Captain's mouth to keep him from making a noise, and if he
                              did, they were ordered to shoot him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6700">I have no words to express the horror with which I heard this last
                              circumstance. I trusted, and indeed Major Wood seemed to be of that
                              opinion, that Col. Trevor had really been beside himself; but regarding
                              his conduct even as the effect of frenzy, it was hardly less shocking.
                              From Schwartz the communication only called forth some pithy expressions
                              of detestation, without seeming to interrupt the working of his
                              thoughts, which were at once busy to devise some remedy for the evil.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6703">Witt was differently affected. His whole frame and countenance
                              assumed an appearance of stony rigidity, betokening fixed and fearful
                              purpose. He turned his glaring eye to the spot where Col. Trevor had
                              fallen, with an expression that showed his vengeance quite unsatisfied.
                              A glance of fierce scorn fell for a moment on Cottle; and then, with a
                              searching look, he addressed himself to Major Wood.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6706">“Major Wood,” said he, with a voice whose deep, stern tones,
                              demanded the truth and the whole truth, “did you know any thing of
                              this business?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6710">“Upon my honor, I did not; and Captain Cottle, who did know, will
                              tell you so.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6713">“I would hardly take 
                              <hi id="d2e6715" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> word 
                              <hi id="d2e6718" style="font-style: italic;">against himself</hi>,” said Witt, with cold
                              contempt, and not even turning his eye on Cottle. Then pausing a
                              moment, he added, with the same look of severe scrutiny, “Major
                              Wood, do you know who Captain Douglas is? Do you know that he
                              is Col. Trevor's own brother?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6722">“Great God!” exclaimed the Major. “Douglas Trevor! That fine,
                              intelligent, accomplished, noble young man!—”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6725">“Did you know him?” asked the other.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6728">“I did,” said Wood, “and loved him well. Poor fellow! Poor fellow!
                              His doom is sealed.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6731">“That's enough,” said Witt. “I see now that you had no hand in
                              it. But is it not your duty, Major Wood, to bring back Captain Douglas
                              and set him at liberty?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6735">“Would to God that I could,” said the Major; “but he is quite beyond
                              my reach before this.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6738">“See here, Major,” said Schwartz; “write an order to that sergeant
                              to bring him back, and give me a pass to follow him without being
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6740"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="214" data-tei-n="207"> </a></span>
                              stopped, and I will have him back in no time. Them fellows lost
                              ground here crossing the river, and I can catch them.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6743">“That might do,” said the Major, hesitatingly; “and I am bound
                              in honor to do it, because his capture was a breach of my truce. But
                              I shall never be forgiven. No matter; it shall be done if they break
                              me for it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6746">“
                              <hi id="d2e6748" style="font-style: italic;">You</hi> may thank the Major,” said Witt, turning his implacable eye
                              on Cottle, “for that word; for it has given 
                              <hi id="d2e6751" style="font-style: italic;">you</hi> a chance for your life.
                              But for that, you would have been hanging like a dog in half an hour.
                              Now, Major, I don't want you to come to any harm; and so you shall
                              have a fair excuse. Bring Captain Douglas back to us, and we will let
                              this fellow go. But if the Captain is not here before the week is out,
                              then, as sure as there is a God in Heaven, he shall be hanged for a spy,
                              as he is.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6755">There is a difference between the certainty of being hanged in half
                              an hour, and a chance of escape, however unpromising. To Captain
                              Cottle, who had not ventured nearer to Jones's Ford than the rear of
                              the dragoons, and who was now in greater peril than he had ever willingly
                              encountered, the difference was of great importance. Yet his
                              hopes were faint, for he had heard the orders of Trevor, which enjoined
                              despatch; and he was equally earnest in hurrying the Major and
                              Schwartz. His impertinence was cut short by ordering him to close
                              custody in jail; and the credentials of Schwartz being soon prepared,
                              he set out on his journey.

                           <p id="d2e6776">LET us again intrude into the sanctuary of majesty. The President
                              is alone, as before. He has the same air of somewhat impatient expectation.
                              A shade of anxious thought is on his brow, and his cheek
                              is flushed with some little excitement. Yet these elements are all so
                              mixed as to be scarcely perceptible; and were he conscious that we are
                              looking at him, they would be completely concealed. On the table lie
                              a number of letters recently received. Two of them are separated
                              from the rest. He takes up one and reads it a second time. Let us
                              look over him. It runs thus:
                              
                              <quote style=" display: inline; ">“The wisest may be deceived; the most vigilant may be betrayed:
                                 for the MOST trusted are often the most treacherous. CAUTION.”

                           <p id="d2e6782">“What means this?” said the President, musingly. “Who is it that
                              I am warned against? The word ‘MOST’ is underscored. Who does
                              that point at? Whom do I trust 
                              <hi id="d2e6784" style="font-style: italic;">most</hi>? I trust nobody. But I

                              to trust; and whom 
                              <hi id="d2e6790" style="font-style: italic;">most</hi>? Surely, it cannot be he. I should, indeed,
                              be wrong to trust to his 
                              <hi id="d2e6793" style="font-style: italic;">fidelity</hi>. But he is too wise to be false
                              to his own interest. But may he not have an interest that I am not
                              aware of? It must be considered.”

                           <p id="d2e6798">He then took up the other letter, which I beg leave to lay before the
                              reader, as a specimen of the art with which the truth may be so told as
                              to make others believe what is false. I recommend it particularly to
                              military gentlemen, reporting the results of a battle.

                                       head of my own regiment, one battalion of the 15th, a company of artillery
                                       and of dragoons, to meet Douglas on his descent from the

                                       mountains. At Jones's Ford, on Staunton river, I encountered him,
                                       when about half his force had crossed over. I attacked him immediately,
                                       and, after a sharp conflict, drove him across the river. By the
                                       advice of Col. Mason, I left the artillery and dragoons on the north
                                       bank, to protect our rear, placing them under the command of that
                                       distinguished officer.

                                       just as he had fallen back on the reserve. Here he rallied, and the
                                       fight was renewed. I regret to say that, at the first fire, my horse fell
                                       under me, imprisoning my leg by his fall. At the same moment a
                                       ball struck my head, and I came to the ground insensible.

                                       that I was in the hands of the enemy, who assisted me to rise. I
                                       immediately called to my men to resume their arms, but am sorry to
                                       inform you that I was not obeyed. As I had not surrendered, I was
                                       seized and hurried away to the house of a ringleader of these rebels,
                                       where I was confined. From that time I had no means of receiving
                                       any information on which I could rely concerning the events of the
                                       day, as I had no intercourse with any but the rebels.

                                       of Major Wood, beleaguered by the rebels, and a treaty for surrender
                                       in full progress. I rejoice that I have returned in time to prevent a
                                       consummation so disgraceful.

                              that the only way to judge in advance of what a man will do, is
                              to ascertain his interest. See how readily it settled this nice point of
                              casuistry—this delicate question of conflicting duties

                              and every day confirms it. Here comes a new example,” added

                              creeping, cautious tread; his countenance nothing of its abject servility.
                              But there was more of anxiety and less of hope, with a slight
                              appearance of peevish dissatisfaction.

                              for though my duties are clearly necessary to the good of the State,
                              I find it hard to bear the loud reproaches of a misjudging multitude,
                              that reach me through a factious press.”

                              issue from loyal lips. I take care not to know what is said of me by

                              single breath, reach the heart. I can never, I fear, make myself proof
                              against such a phrase as ‘

                              my dear sir. Some feeling must be expected when the edge of the
                              law falls on victims whose offences demand punishment, and yet are
                              such as those the world calls honorable and upright are most likely to

                              and when the curse rises up against me, loud as well as deep, and uttered
                              and echoed on every side, I pray your Excellency to pardon me
                              when I say that I find its honors and emoluments a poor compensation.”

                              whose crimes offend against the laws of God as well as man; and who
                              is not more obnoxious to State policy than to the detestation of all good
                              men, and of none more than yourself.”

                           <p id="d2e6909">“Of no other than that young fellow, Trevor, whose ill luck snatched
                              him away from our hands, when perhaps he was not quite ripe for
                              punishment. But he has since made himself perfect in crime, by becoming
                              the leader of a desperate banditti. In short, he is no other
                              than the famous Captain Douglas, and is now in my power. I think
                              you will find in his case a fair set-off against some of the mortifications
                              of which you complain; and think no more of denying your services
                              to the public, at least until he has fulfilled his destiny.”

                           <p id="d2e6912">The effect of this communication on the mind of the honorable
                              gentleman was such as the President had anticipated. To every being
                              of the name of Trevor he bore a mortal antipathy. In the case of
                              Douglas, this was rendered more intense by the sympathy of a father
                              with a favorite son. An envious malignity was a striking feature in
                              the characters both of father and son; and this had been provoked to
                              the utmost by that unfortunate young man. Both were sensible that
                              the younger Baker had been in bad odor with the public ever since
                              the affair at the falls; and hence, it was not only grateful to their
                              malice, but to their pride, to fasten on Douglas a stigma so dishonorable
                              as to have relation back, and to excuse his adversary with those

                              President went on to give him some particulars of the late military
                              occurrences. Douglas, he said, was on the road, and would reach
                              Washington the next day. The letter, it seems, had been brought by a
                              soldier who had orders to outgo the rest of the party, and ride express
                              to Washington.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6926">“It is well,” said the President, “that I have this timely intimation
                              of his approach. The custody of State prisoners cannot be safely entrusted
                              to any but the military; and that of this young man must be safely
                              committed to no corps in which he had any acquaintance. It seems
                              that he was a universal favorite among men and officers. I am about
                              to take measures to guard against any such blunder.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6929">In such conversation half an hour was passed, when the Minister
                              made his appearance. He had been sent for, and to him the President
                              communicated the history of the capture of Douglas. Had he turned
                              an eye of close scrutiny on the favorite, at the moment when he uttered
                              the name, and announced the fate of his victim, he might have
                              seen a slight expression of countenance which it would not have been
                              easy to interpret. But this escaped him; and he went on to direct
                              that the true name of the prisoner should be kept secret; that his arrival
                              should be watched for; and that he should be at once conducted
                              to a place provided for the separate confinement of State prisoners.
                              It was, moreover, ordered that a detail of officers and men for that
                              prison should be carefully made, so as to exclude any persons whose
                              loyalty was at all doubtful; and especially all who, from former
                              associations, could be supposed to feel any kindness for Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6933">Finally, it was agreed that, should he arrive in the course of that
                              night, or the next day, he should be brought, on the following night,
                              before the triumvirate, in the room where they then were.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6936">“You were right,” continued the President, addressing his Minister,
                              “when you said that this young man had talent. The discovery of his
                              identity explains the marvellous organization and efficiency of that
                              wild banditti that he commanded. His capture must be fatal to their
                              future success. They must be powerless now that they have lost their
                              leader, and must soon disband. That is well. The two regiments may
                              now be marched from Lynchburg to Richmond, and save us the necessity
                              of sending a reinforcement from this quarter. The troops there,
                              with this aid, will certainly be sufficient to check the insurrectionary
                              movements that we hear of in the southern counties, and to cover the
                              meeting of the Legislature. Col. Trevor has certainly deserved well.
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e6938"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="220" data-tei-n="213"> </a></span>
                              I am afraid his unfortunate wound may have occasioned the loss of
                              more men than we could well spare, who seem to have surrendered
                              while he was insensible. But the disabling of Douglas's corps will, of
                              course, set them at liberty to return to their duty. But this takes nothing
                              from Col. Trevor's merit. He must be brevetted. As to Major
                              Wood, in the regular course he should succeed Mason; but I must
                              hear more of this negotiation for a surrender of his post, before he is
                              promoted. That affair must be satisfactorily explained, or he will
                              hardly escape a court-martial.”

                           <p id="d2e6970">ON his departure from Lynchburg, Schwartz had been provided
                              with a suit of clothes half military, to prevent the notice which his
                              rude mountain attire would have attracted. The day was half spent
                              before he was on the road, and the sergeant and his party were already
                              far in advance of him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6973">Col. Trevor had been desirous, for obvious reasons, that his letter
                              and prisoner should reach Washington as soon as possible, and had
                              ordered the party to proceed with all practicable despatch. But, as they
                              might be somewhat retarded by the necessary care of their prisoner,
                              he had directed that the letter should be sent on, as we have seen, by a
                              single soldier, who had reached Washington on the second night. But
                              the sergeant was not far behind, and had used such diligence that he
                              crossed the bridge the next morning at an early hour, just as poor
                              Schwartz came in sight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6977">He recognized the party by the peculiar dress of Douglas, with
                              which he was so familiar; but it was too late. He followed, however,
                              disconcerted by his failure, but not desponding. At the farther end of
                              the bridge he was struck with the countenance and manner of a fine
                              looking man of genteel but plain appearance, who stood gazing
                              earnestly after the prisoner and his guard.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6980">Observing Schwartz, he asked eagerly who the prisoner was, and
                              was told it was Captain Douglas.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6983">“Good God!” exclaimed he, in a tone of deep concern; “is it possible?
                              But thank God! it is no worse.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6986">“Did you think it was anybody you knew?” asked the quick-witted
                              Schwartz.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6989">“Yes,” replied the other. “I was almost sure it was a friend of my
                              own.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6992">“And what was your friend's name, stranger? if I may be so bold.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6996">“You are bold enough,” said the youth. “I am not in the habit
                              of answering questions unless I know who asks them, and why.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e6999">“I don't mean no harm, young man,” replied Schwartz; “and if
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e7001"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="222" data-tei-n="215"> </a></span>
                              you tell me your friend's name and your own too, may be you won't be
                              sorry for it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7004">The stranger looked hard at Schwartz, and in his serious, earnest,
                              and sagacious countenance, saw enough to make him curious to know
                              what this meant. He therefore replied that his friend was Lieutenant
                              Trevor, late of the United States Dragoons.

                              have I wished to know where to find you! Had I been with you, this
                              might have been prevented.”

                           <p id="d2e7041">“May be it is best as it is,” said Schwartz. “The Captain did not
                              want for friends where he was. May be one friend here will do him
                              more good than a hundred anywhere else. That is what I am here for
                              now.”

                              Thank God! I saw him. But for that we might not have found out

                           <p id="d2e7054">Whiting now showed Schwartz where to bestow his horse, and afterwards
                              conducted him to his lodgings. These were in an obscure suburb,
                              humble, plain, and poorly fitted up. Appearances showed that
                              the occupant spent most of his time with the pen, although many of
                              the relics of his former military equipments were to be seen about the
                              room. But the dust on his cap, which hung against the wall, and the
                              mould on the belt and scabbard of his sword, showed that these had
                              been long unused. In truth, the escape of Douglas and his uncle had
                              been fatal to him as a soldier. He had been dismissed the army; and
                              now, as it seemed, earned a poor livelihood by doing for small wages
                              the manual labor of those offices, the salaries of which are received by
                              men who do nothing at all.

                              in distances,” as Monsieur Serrurier said of it, and while a hasty
                              breakfast was preparing for Schwartz, he gave Whiting the particulars
                              of the late battle at Jones's Ford; of Douglas's capture, and of his
                              brother's death, and the surrender of the camp. As soon as he had
                              seen his guest provided for, the young man left him alone. Going out,
                              he proceeded to the first stand of coaches, and stepping into one was
                              driven to the Minister's. Here he alighted, showed a ticket to the
                              porter, entered, threaded several passages, descended a dark stair, and,
                              going into a small room in the basement, touched the spring of a bell.
                              No answering sound was heard; but, in half an hour the Minister appeared.

                              Trevor is in the power of his enemies, and is expected here to-day?”

                              description have been marched into Virginia, and that, except raw
                              recruits, there are none here that it was thought safe to trust on that

                              those same raw recruits. Think you there are many here who could be
                              relied on to peril every thing on behalf of your friend?”

                           <p id="d2e7085">“No doubt of it. I was long enough in the army after his disgrace
                              to know that his whole regiment were indignant at it. A hundred can
                              be found ready to wipe it out with the blood of the President, or their
                              own.”

                              return. You will know what to do. Did you know those who had him

                              will have my best wishes; and the time may come when you may have
                              it in your power to do me justice. My country is to me, Mr. Whiting,

                              what yours is to you. When New England was permitted to join in
                              what you will call the plunder of the South, I was not very scrupulous
                              about the means of securing her share. But nearly all that was worth
                              having is irretrievably lost. What remains can only be retained by
                              means which will but make it an instrument of power in the hands of
                              this man, and so enable him to perpetuate his reign according to the
                              forms of the constitution. Take that away, and leave the matter
                              altogether to the votes of the northern States, and I shall not long have
                              to play second to him. In order to preserve his power, he would be
                              compelled to break up the system of monopoly contrived for the exclusive
                              benefit of his favorite Empire State; or perhaps to concur with me in
                              severing a Union, the benefits of which are now lost, by the escape of
                              our common prey, and of which 
                              <hi id="d2e7098" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> bear all the inconveniences. Of
                              course, I do not pretend that the place to which the favor of my
                              countrymen may advance me in either event, has no charms for me.
                              But you will see that I am actuated by no low and sordid ambition. I
                              am desirous you should see it in this light. It is not my fortune to
                              command the services of many whose esteem is eminently desirable. I
                              am, therefore, the more ambitious of yours. Should I succeed, my
                              acts will vindicate my motives. Should I fail, (and if Virginia
                              disenthralls herself I shall not fail,) you will do me this justice. What
                              news have you of the movements of B—?”

                              was informed that a gentleman and lady craved the favor of a private
                              audience. He directed that they should be shown into the room, the
                              privacy of which we have so often violated, and soon after he entered it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7121">A lady, whose figure and dress denoted youth, was seated on the
                              sofa. She was in deep mourning, and a black veil completely hid her
                              face. By her side sat a gentleman far advanced in life, and of a most
                              venerable aspect. His fair complexion had blanched by time into the
                              cold dead whiteness of age. The color had, in like manner, faded
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d2e7123"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="218"> </a></span>
                              from his pale blue eye; and the quivering of his livid lip, and the
                              trembling of his eyelids, betokened deep and anxious distress. 
                              <hi id="d2e7125" style="font-style: italic;">His</hi>
                              dress also was of black, mournfully contrasting with the almost unearthly
                              whiteness of his face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7129">At the entrance of the President both rose; and the trembling and
                              agitated old gentleman might be seen to give way for a moment, as if
                              about to throw himself on his knees before “the dreaded prince whose
                              will was fate.” But he recovered himself, and with an air of suppliant
                              dignity, stood as erect as the weakness and infirmity of age permitted.
                              The President approached him with a look of perplexity and doubt;
                              and, gazing earnestly at him, said: “I beg to know, sir, who it is.
                              Bless me! Mr. Trevor, is it possible that I see you here, at this
                              moment?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7133">“I am here, sir,” replied the old gentleman, “a broken-hearted,
                              bereaved father, lamenting the loss of one son, and suppliant for the life
                              of another; and this is my niece, who is come to join her prayers to
                              mine, on behalf of her betrothed husband.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7136">There was enough in these words to add to the maiden confusion of
                              poor Delia, but not enough to prevent her from lifting a timid glance,
                              in which there was as much of entreaty as her proud spirit could descend
                              to. She met the eye of the President, as with an air of quick
                              and eager surprise he turned towards her; and in his eye she read a
                              meaning which, in the moment, blasted her hopes and confirmed her
                              in all her detestation of the cold, selfish, and crafty politician, whom
                              she now beheld for the first time. She saw, instantly, that she was the
                              object of some subtle purpose; and felt, that by putting herself in his
                              power, she had but prepared for her husband a deeper distress than all
                              the severities of the law could inflict. But she quailed not at the
                              thought. Her proud and bold spirit came in aid of her weakness; her
                              pale cheek burnt with an indignant glow, and the tears were dissipated
                              from her eyes in the bright and almost fierce glance that flashed from
                              them. Even through her veil too much of this appeared to escape the
                              notice of the President.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7139">He instantly turned away; and, with an air and tone of the most candied
                              courtesy, addressed Mr. Trevor: “You speak in riddles, my dear
                              sir,” said he; “I beg you to explain.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7142">“My task is more painful than I had anticipated,” said the poor old
                              man. “Have I, then, to be the herald of my poor Owen's death, and
                              of the yet more disastrous fate of my other noble boy?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7145">“Col. Trevor dead, sir!” exclaimed the President. “Impossible!
                              I have just received a letter from him, written on the 12th.”

                              fell next morning. I received the news yesterday by the railroad; and
                              by travelling all night by the same conveyance, I am here to entreat
                              that the axe may not glean what the sword has left me. My poor
                              boy Douglas, I am told, is in your power, and perhaps here.”

                              not deny that I expect him; and regret that it is under circumstances
                              which will not allow me the pleasure of extending to him the same
                              courtesy I shall be happy to render to you. Compose yourself, my
                              dear sir; let me beg you and your niece to retire to rooms which are
                              always ready to receive you where I am master; and let me send for
                              your baggage.”

                              mind, instantly exclaimed: “No, my uncle! No, my father! The
                              palace of a tyrant is a prison. There is no mercy here. No hope for
                              my noble husband. Save yourself. Return home while you may, and
                              leave me here to share his fate. Our friends 
                              <hi id="d2e7162" style="font-style: italic;">may</hi> rescue us. They
                              WILL avenge us. But in that cold eye there is no relenting.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d2e7166">“You are harsh, lady,” said the President; “I will not add, unjust.
                              I will prove that, by permitting your instant departure, without even
                              enquiring where you lodge.”

                              said: Take the number of that coach, and let the driver attend me
                              this evening.” Then, as the servant left the room, he went on: “Why,
                              this is better and better. I think I have holds enough now on Baker
                              to bind him to his task, however his heart may yearn after his beggarly
                              estate in Virginia. It seems, forsooth, that after all that has passed,
                              his son yet has a hankering after this girl; the only woman, as he says,
                              that he ever truly loved. It may be but spite against his favored
                              rival; or it may be, in truth, that every thing that bears the shape of
                              man is susceptible of love, or what passes for it. Be it so. He may
                              be gratified; but his father shall fulfil conditions.”

                           <p id="d2e7172">In the evening of the same day the following letter was put into the

                              within the palace; and when you give the order mark well its effect
                              on him you most trust. CAUTION.”
                           </p>

                              <hi id="d2e7181" style="font-style: italic;">proof</hi> as well as accusation,” said the President.
                              “Here 
                              <hi id="d2e7184" style="font-style: italic;">is</hi> treason. How else is it known that Trevor was to be brought
                              here to-night? I will improve this hint. A rescue is to be attempted!
                              Is that it? Then the guard will be attacked on their return without
                              the prisoner. Wo to the traitor if it prove so!”
