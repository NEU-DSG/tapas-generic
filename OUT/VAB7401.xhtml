                           many poets and
                           remarkable people, though we were not always conscious of our privileges. Things certainly
                           strike
                           children oddly, partially, and for such unexpected reasons. They are so busy in early
                           life with all
                           that is going on on every side, that one person or another person, the visitor in
                           the drawing-room,
                           the tortoise-shell cat on the garden wall, the cook's little boy who has come in to
                           partake of cold
                           pudding, all seem very nearly as important one as the other. Perhaps I should not
                           have been so much
                           impressed by my first conscious sight of a poet, if I had then realized all the notabilities
                           who
                           came to our house from time to time. My special poet was a French-man. I first heard
                           his name in
                           London, at a class which I attended in company with a good many other little girls
                           my
                           contemporaries, which class, indeed, still continues, and succeeding generations receive
                           the
                           decorations, the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e536" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">prÃ©sidences</foreign> and the

                        <p id="d74890e544">My poet was a hair-dresser by profession, and a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="4"> </a></span> barber as well. His
                           name was Jasmin (Jaquou Jansemin in the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e548" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">langue d'Oc </foreign>). He
                           was born in 1798 at Agen, in the south of France; <q style=" display: inline; ">"born,"</q> he writes, <q style=" display: inline; ">"of a humpback father
                              and a halting mother in the corner of an old street, in a crowded dwelling, peopled
                              by many
                              rats, on Holy Thursday, at the hour when pancakes are tossed."</q> The humpback father was also
                           a poet in his way, and composed songs for the itinerant players of the neighborhood.
                           So soon as
                           Jasmin could walk he used to accompany his father to the booths, but what he liked
                           better still was
                           gathering fagots in the little islands of the Garonne. <q style=" display: inline; ">"Bareheaded, barefooted," </q> he writes,
                           <q style=" display: inline; ">"we rowed across the stream. I was not alone: there were twenty of us â€” there were
                              thirty of
                              us. We started at the stroke of the mid-day hour, singing in choir."</q> In the evening the
                           children returned as they had leftâ€”<q style=" display: inline; ">"thirty voices chaunting the same cadence, and thirty fagots
                              dancing on thirty heads."</q> They were so poor that Jacques felt it bitterly because his
                           parents could not afford to send him to school. One day he was playing in the market-place
                           when he
                           saw his grandfather carried by to the hospital. It was there the Jasmins were in the
                           habit of dying.
                           But a cousin taught him to read; he became apprenticed to a barber; he rose to be
                           a hair-dresser,
                           and. prospered in his vocation, so. that he was able to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="5"> </a></span> save his
                           father from the usual fate of the Jasmins. The hair-dresser christened his first poems
                           
                           <foreign id="d74890e569" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">Les Papillotes</foreign>, in honor of his profession; which songs, says
                           he, brought a silver streamlet through his shop, and upon this silver streamlet he
                           floated to better
                           fortunes than were usual to the Jasmin family. One day, in a fit of poetic ardor,
                           he broke the
                           terrible arm-chair in which they had all been in the habit of being carried to the
                           hospital. Jasmin,
                           after he became celebrated, would never abandon his home or his little shop, but from
                           time to time
                           he went for a journey; sometimes he would come to Paris, where he was kindly recognized
                           by other
                           authors more fortunate in their worldly circumstances, and he would be made to repeat
                           his own songs
                           by the great ladies who took him up. Chief among them was Lady Elgin, who lived in
                           Paris then, and
                           who was a good friend to all literary aspirants. Longfellow was also among Jasmin's
                           admirers, and
                           translated some of his works. Much of all this I have since read in the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e572" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Nationale</foreign>. As children at our French classes we had only learned
                           some of his lines by heart. I used to break down in utter confusion when my turn came
                           to recite, but
                           at the same time I believe I took in a great deal more than I had any idea of, as
                           I sat there
                           incompetent, wool-gathering. In that long, bare room, only ornamented by a few large
                           maps and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="6"> </a></span> with a flowing border of governesses, there came to one many of
                           those impressions which are not dates or facts, and which don't, alas! count for good
                           marks, but
                           which nevertheless are very useful and agreeable possessions in after-days. We used
                           to have
                           delightful French lessons in literature and poetry, and I still remember the dazzling
                           visions of
                           troubadours evoked by our teacherâ€”troubadours amid the golden landscapes of the south
                           of France, as
                           described in the 
                           <title id="d74890e578">Mysteries of Udolpho</title> the poems themselves as he quoted them almost
                           seemed to have wings and to come flying out of the well-thumbed 
                           <foreign id="d74890e581" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">Recueil</foreign>! We had lessons in morality and in experience as well as in literature. I can
                           still hear M. Roche in his melodious voice quoting <q style=" display: inline; ">
                              <foreign id="d74890e585" xml:lang="fr">"de tout laurier un

                              </foreign></q> and praising the philosophical aptness of the
                           illustration, which seemed to me so splendid that I was quite overpowered by it as
                           I went home with
                           my governess along South Audley Street. There was another heart-rending poem about
                           an angel standing
                           by a cradle and contemplating its own image in the face of an infant, <q style=" display: inline; ">"reflected as in a
                              stream."</q> The angel finally carries away the poor baby, and the mother kneels weeping by the
                           empty cradle. It was a sort of Christmas-card of a poem well suited to the sentimental
                           experience of
                           a little girl of twelve or thirteen years old, and I then and there <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="7"> </a></span>
                           determined that Reboul was my favorite author, after all. But there were many others
                           besides Reboul.
                           Poor AndrÃ© Chenier we were all in love with, and Jasmin aforesaid held his own among
                           the worthy
                           recipients of that golden flower of poesy which played such an important part in our
                           early
                           education, and which was (so we learned) yearly bestowed by the inhabitants of Toulouse
                           upon the
                           most successful competitors in the art. I used to picture the flower itself as a radiant,
                           quivering
                           object covered with delicate, glittering workmanship. Perhaps nowadays I realize that
                           golden flowers
                           of poesy are also bestowed in the south of Englandâ€” in Waterloo Place, or Bedford
                           Street, Covent
                           Garden, shall we say?â€”round golden tokens which are not without their own special
                           graces.

                        <p id="d74890e594">But to return to my memoirs. Our life was divided between London and Paris, where
                           our grandparents
                           dwelt, and where we spent a part of every year, and all my recent studies and experiences
                           rushed
                           into my mind one day soon after our return to France, when my grandmother told me
                           that she had been
                           asked to a party at Lady Elgin's to meet a poet, that his name was Jasmin, and that
                           she was going to
                           take me with her! My heart leaped with excitement; Jasminâ€”the Southâ€”golden flowersâ€”

                           and me in our Sunday best, drove off into the dark streets. We were escorted down-stairs
                           by the
                           cook, with an extra lantern, I remember, and my grandfather in his little black silk
                           toque waved
                           farewell over the staircase. We started expectant, rolling over the rattling stones;
                           we crossed the
                           bridge and saw the dark river below us reflecting the lightsâ€”I remember no stars,
                           but a damp and
                           drizzly darkness overhead, which, for some reason, added to my excitement. We reached
                           the ancient
                           
                           <foreign id="d74890e604" xml:lang="fr">faubourg</foreign> before very long, where the oil-lamps swung by chains
                           across the streets; we turned into the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e607" xml:lang="fr">Rue de Varennes</foreign>, where Lady
                           Elgin lived, and the coachman rapped at the great closed gates of the house, which
                           opened with a
                           grinding sound, and we walked across the court-yard. The apartment was on the ground-floor
                           of a
                           fine, melancholy old house.

                        <p id="d74890e611">I followed my grandmother in her brown velvet gown and her diamond brooch into the
                           reception-room. I
                           remember being surprised to find the gay world so dark on the whole, and talking in
                           such a confused
                           and subdued murmur. I had expected chandeliers, bursts of laughter, people in masks
                           and dominoes. I
                           had taken my ideas from bon-bon-boxes and crackers., But it was evidently all rightâ€”my
                           grandmother
                           looked greatly pleased and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span> animated. I saw her speaking to one
                           person and to another in her dignified way; her manners were true grandmother's mannersâ€”kind,
                           but
                           distant and serious. We considered our grandmother a very important personage, and
                           I remember
                           feeling not a little proud of her beauty and dignity as we moved along. She was not
                           one of your
                           "remains;" she was a very noble-looking old lady, holding her head high, and her diamond
                           cap-pin
                           flashed as she moved across the room.

                        <p id="d74890e616">My grandmother looked pleased and animated, as I have said, and when her friends came
                           up to speak to
                           her she introduced me to some of them. Almost the very first person she greeted, but
                           to whom she did
                           not introduce me, was a handsome, rather romantic, fashionable-looking gentleman,
                           with a quantity of
                           dark hair, and a glass in one eye, leaning against the wall by the door as we entered.
                           She said a
                           few words as we passed. I heard something about "Lady Charlotte," and then we walked
                           on, and
                           presently we came upon another girl, younger than myself and very distinguished looking,
                           in a plaid
                           frock, with beautiful shining braids of thick hair, who seemed quite at home and used
                           to the house;
                           she was with her mother, a regal-looking little woman, with a fine profile and a gold
                           crown; I can
                           still see her in a long green velvet robe slowly crossing the room; she was a well-known

                           youngest daughter. While Mrs. Chapman and my grandmother were talking to one another,
                           little Anne
                           Chapman, who seemed to know most of the people, began telling me who they all were.
                           A great many
                           pages out of M. Roche's

                           all sorts of notable folks murmuring to one another in the big rooms.

                           <said id="d74890e633">"And which is the poet?"</said> said I, eagerly.

                           <said id="d74890e639"> "Oh, where?"</said> said I. 
                           <said id="d74890e642">"Oh, not

                           </said> For suddenly, just under the swinging chandelier, I see a head,
                           like the figure-head of a shipâ€”a jolly, red, shiny, weather-beaten face, with large,
                           round,
                           prominent features, ornamented with little pomatumy wisps of hair, and a massive torso
                           clothed in a
                           mag- nificent frilled shirt over a pink lining....

                           </said> I falter, gazing at Punchinello, high-shouldered, good-humored! 
                           <said id="d74890e654">"Yes, of
                              course it is that,"
                           </said> said the little girl, laughing at my dismay; and the crowd seems to
                           form a circle, in the centre of which stands this droll being, who now begins to recite
                           in a
                           monotonous voice.

                           monotonous voice rises and falls. It leaves off at last, the poet wipes the perspiration
                           from his
                           brow; there is a moment's silence, then a murmur of admiration from the crowd which
                           closes round
                           him. I see the Punchinello being led up to somebody to be thanked and congratulated;
                           my heart goes
                           down, down; more murmurs, more exclamations. The little girl is gone, I am all alone
                           with my
                           disappointment, and then my grandmother calls me to her side and says it is time to
                           come away. As we
                           move towards the door again, we once more pass Mr. Locker, and he nods kindly, and
                           tells me he knows
                           my father. "Well, and what do you think of Jasmin?" he asks; but I can't answer him,
                           my illusions
                           are dashed. As we drive off through the streets the rain is still falling, the oil-lamps
                           are
                           swinging; we cross the bridge once more, but how dull, how dark, how sad it all seems!
                           My
                           grandmother, sitting upright in the dark carriage, says she has spent a very pleasant
                           evening, and
                           that she is delighted with Jasmnin's simplicity and originality. I who had longed
                           to see a poet! who
                           had pictured something so different! I swallowed down <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span> as best I
                           could that gulp of salt-water which is so apt to choke us when we first take our plunge
                           into the
                           experience of life.

                           try to speak cheerfully.

                           and the bitterness
                           of that childish disappointment. How little do we mortals recognize our good-fortune
                           that comes to
                           us now and again in a certain humorous disguise. Why, I had been in a world of poets!
                           A poet had
                           greeted me, a poet had sung to me, I had been hustled by poets; there in the crowd
                           (for all I know
                           to the contrary) were Lamartine and Chateaubriand and Girardin and MÃ©rimÃ©eâ€”so, at
                           least, some one
                           who was present on this occasion reminds me. And as for Frederick Locker, does not
                           his caged
                           musicâ€”like that of the bird of Wood Streetâ€”echo along the arid pavements with sweetest
                           and most
                           welcome note to charm the passers-by as the echoes of "London Lyrics" fall upon the
                           listening ear?
                           And the red face was also that of a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="13"> </a></span> true poet, born to sing his
                           sweet, unpretending song from a true heart, and to bring music into humble places.

                           to be when it
                           was going on. For one thing it isn't nearly so long now as it was then, and remembered
                           events come
                           cheerfully scurrying up one after another, while the intervening periods are no longer
                           the
                           portentous cycles they once were. And another thing to consider is that the people
                           walking in and
                           out of the by-gone mansions of life were not, to our newly-opened eyes, the interesting
                           personages
                           many of them have since become; 
                           <hi id="d74890e712" style="font-style: italic;">then</hi> they were men walking as trees before us,
                           without names or histories; 
                           <hi id="d74890e715" style="font-style: italic;">now</hi> some of the very names mean for us the history of
                           our time. Very young people's eyes are certainly of more importance to them than their
                           ears, and
                           they all 
                           <hi id="d74890e718" style="font-style: italic;">see</hi> the persons they are destined to spend their lives with long before
                           the figures begin to talk and to explain themselves.

                        <p id="d74890e723">My grandmother had a little society of her own at Paris, in the midst of which she
                           seemed to reign
                           from dignity and kindness of heart; her friends, it must be confessed, have not as
                           yet become
                           historic, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span> but she herself was well worthy of a record.
                           Grandmothers in books and memoirs are mostly alike â€”stately, old-fashioned, kindly,
                           and critical.
                           Mine was no exception to the general rule. She had been one of the most beautiful
                           women of her time;
                           she was very tall, with a queenly head and carriage; she always moved in a dignified
                           way. She had an
                           odd taste in dress, I remember, and used to walk out in a red merino cloak trimmed
                           with ermine,
                           which gave her the air of a retired empress wearing out her robes. She was a woman
                           of strong
                           feeling, somewhat imperious, with a passionate love for little children, and with
                           extraordinary
                           sympathy and enthusiasm for any one in trouble or in disgrace. How benevolently she
                           used to look
                           round the room at her many 
                           <foreign id="d74890e727" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">protÃ©gÃ©s,</foreign> with her beautiful
                           gray eyes! Her friends as a rule were shorter than she was and brisker, less serious
                           and emotional.
                           They adopted her views upon politics, religion, and homÅ“pathy, or at all events did
                           not venture to
                           contradict them. But they certainly could not reach her heights, and her almost romantic
                           passion of
                           feeling.

                        <p id="d74890e731">A great many of my earliest recollections seem to consist of old ladiesâ€”armies of
                           old ladies, so they
                           appear to me, as I look back through the larger end of my glasses to the time when
                           my sister and I
                           were two little girls living at Paris. I remember once that after a long stay in England
                           with <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="25" data-tei-n="19"> </a></span> our father, the old ladies seemed changed somehow to our more
                           experienced eyes. They were the same, but with more variety; not all alike as they
                           had seemed
                           before, not all the same age; some were younger, some were older than we had remembered
                           themâ€”one was
                           actually married! Our grandmother looked older to us this time when we came back to
                           Paris; we were
                           used to seeing our father's gray hair, but that hers should turn white too seemed
                           almost unnatural.
                           The very first day we walked out with her after our return, we met the bride of whose
                           marriage we
                           had heard while we were away. She was a little dumpy, good-natured woman of about
                           forty-five, I
                           supposeâ€”shall I ever forget the thrill with which we watched her approach, hanging
                           with careless
                           grace upon her husband's arm ? She wore light, tight kid gloves upon her little fat
                           hands, and a
                           bonnet like a bride's cake. Marriage had not made her proud as it does some people;
                           she recognized
                           us at once and introduced us to the gentleman. 
                           <said id="d74890e735">"Very 'appy to make your acquaintance,
                              miss,"
                           </said> said he. 
                           <said id="d74890e738">"Mrs. C. 'ave often mentioned you at our place."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e741">Children begin by being Philistines. As we parted I said to my grandmother that I
                           had always known
                           people dropped their h's, but that I didn't know one ever married them. My grandmother
                           seemed trying
                           not to laugh, but she answered gravely that <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span> Mr. and Mrs. C. looked
                           very happy, h's or no h's. And so they did, walking off along those illuminated Elysian
                           fields gay
                           with the echoes of Paris in May, while the children capered to itinerant music, and
                           flags were
                           flying and penny trumpets ringing, and strollers and spectators were lining the way,
                           and the long
                           interminable procession of carriages in the centre of the road went rolling steadily
                           towards the
                           Bois de Boulogne. As we walked homewards evening after evening the sun used to set
                           splendidly in the
                           very centre of the great triumphal arch at the far end of the avenue, and flood everything
                           in a
                           glorious tide of light. What indeed did an aspirate more or less matter at such a
                           moment!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e746">I don't think we ever came home from one of our walks that we did not find our grandfather
                           sitting
                           watching for our grandmother's return. We used to ask him if he didn't find it very
                           dull doing
                           nothing in the twilight, but he used to tell us it was his thinking-time. My sister
                           and I thought
                           thinking dreadfully dull, and only longed for candles and

                           good deal of thinking went on in our peaceful home; we should have liked more doing.
                           One day was
                           just like another; my grandmother and my grandfather sat on either side of the hearth
                           in their two
                           accustomed places; there was a French cook in a white <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="21"> </a></span> cap who
                           brought in the trays and the lamp at the appointed hour; there was 
                           <title id="d74890e753">Chambers</title> on the
                           bookshelf, Pickwick, and one or two of my father's books, and 
                           <title id="d74890e756">The Listener</title>, by
                           Caroline Fry, which used to be my last desperate resource when I had just finished
                           all the others.
                           We lived in a sunny little flat on a fourth floor, with windows east and west and
                           a wide horizon
                           from each, and the sound of the cries from the street below, and the confusing roll
                           of the wheels
                           when the windows were open in summer. In winter time we dined at five by lamp-light
                           at the round
                           table in my grandfather's study. After dinner we used to go into the pretty blue drawing-room
                           where
                           the peat fire would be burning brightly in the open grate, and the evening paper would
                           come in with
                           the tea. I can see it all still, hear it, smell the peat, and taste the odd herbaceous
                           tea and the
                           French bread and butter. On the band of the 
                           <title id="d74890e759">Constitutional</title> newspaper was printed "M.
                           le Major Michel Eschmid." It was not my grandfather's name or anything like it, but
                           he would gravely
                           say that when English people lived in France they must expect to have their names
                           gallicised, and
                           his paper certainly found him out evening after evening. While my grandmother with
                           much emphasis
                           read the pews (she was a fervent republican, and so was my grandfather), my sister
                           and I would sit
                           unconscious <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span> of politics anrd happy over our story-books until the
                           fatal, inevitable moment when a ring was heard at the bell and evening callers were
                           announced. Then
                           we reluctantly shut up our books, for we were told to get our needle-work when the
                           company came in,
                           and we had to find chairs and hand teacups, and answer inquiries, and presently go
                           to bed.

                           was-a talkative, economical, and active little societyâ€”

                           ladies were one and all cordially attached to my grandmother, to my grandfather they
                           were still more
                           devoted. A Major is a Maor. He used to sign their pension papers, administer globules
                           for their
                           colds, give point and support to their political opinions. I can see him still sitting
                           in his
                           arm-chair by the fire with a little semi-circle round about the hearth. Ours was anything
                           but a meek
                           and disappointed community. We may have had our reversesâ€”and very important reverses
                           they all seem
                           to have beenâ€”but we had all had spirit enough to leave our native shores and settle
                           in Paris, not

                           settle in Paris and write works upon the French? Why didn't I write and coax him to
                           come, and tell
                           him that it was our grandmother's wish that he should do so; that the speaker, Mademoiselle

                           sandwich of French and English. Oddly enough, though we talked French, and some of
                           us even looked
                           French, we knew no French people. From time to time at other houses I used to hear
                           of real
                           foreigners, but I don't remember seeing any at ours, except a

                           the same one cannot live abroad without imbibing something of the country, of the
                           air and the earth
                           and the waters among which one is living. Breath and food and raiment are a part of
                           one's life after
                           all, and a very considerable part; and all the wonderful tide of foreign sunshine
                           and the cheerful
                           crowds and happy voices outside, and the very click of pots and pans in the little
                           kitchen at the
                           back seemed to have a character of their own. And so, though we knew nothing of the
                           French, we got
                           to know France and to feel at home there beneath its blue sky, and I think to this
                           day a holiday
                           abroad is ten times more a holiday thana holiday at home. Froth mere habit, one seems

                           acquaintances who visited us on their way to other resortsâ€”to Italy, to the German
                           baths. Some
                           stopped in Paris for a week or two at a time, others for a few days only. I remember
                           three Scotch
                           ladies, for whom my grandmother had a great regard, who were not part of our community,
                           but who used
                           to pass through Paris, and always made a certain stay. ... I was very much afraid
                           of them, though
                           interested at the same time <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="25"> </a></span> as girls are in unknown quantities.
                           They were well connected and had estates and grand relations in the distance, though
                           they seemed to
                           live as simply as we did. One winter it was announced that they had taken an apartment
                           for a few
                           weeks, and next morning I was sent with a note to one of them by my grandmother. They
                           were tall,
                           thin ladies, two were widows, one was a spinster; of the three the unmarried one frightened
                           me most.
                           On this occasion, after reading the note, one of the widow ladies said to the spinster,
                           Miss X., who
                           had her bonnet on, 
                           <said id="d74890e800">"Why, you were just going to call on the child's grandmother, were you not?
                              Why don't you take her back with you in the carriage?" 
                           </said>
                           
                           <said id="d74890e803">"I must first go and see how he is this morning,"</said> said Miss X., somewhat anxiously,
                           
                           <said id="d74890e806">"and then I will take her home, of course. Are the things packed?"</said> A servant came
                           in carrying a large basket with a variety of bottles and viands and napkins. I had
                           not presence of
                           mind to run away as I longed to do, and somehow in a few minutes I found myself sitting
                           in a little
                           open carriage with the Scotch lady, and the basket on the opposite seat. I thought
                           her, if possible,
                           more terrible than everâ€”she seemed grave, preoccupied. She had a long nose, a thick
                           brown
                           complexion, grayish sandy hair, and was dressed in scanty cloth skirts gray and sandy
                           too. She spoke
                           to me, I believe, but <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span> my heart was in my mouth; I hardly dared
                           even listen to what she said. We drove along the Champs ElysÃ©es towards the Arc and
                           then turned into
                           a side street, and presently came to a house at the door of which the carriage stopped.
                           The lady got
                           out, carefully carrying her heavy basket, and told me to follow, and we began to climb
                           the shiny
                           stairsâ€”one, two flights I thinkâ€”then we rang at a bell and the door was almost instantly
                           opened. It
                           was opened by a slight, delicate-looking man with long hair, bright eyes, and a thin,
                           hooked nose.
                           When Miss X. saw him she hastily put down her basket upon the floor, caught both his
                           hands in hers,
                           began to shake them gently, and to scold him in an affectionate reproving way for
                           having come to the
                           door. He laughed, said he had guessed who it was, and motioned to her to enter, and
                           I followed at
                           her sign with the basketâ€”followed into a narrow little room, with no furniture in
                           it whatever but an
                           upright piano against the wall and a few straw chairs standing on the wooden shiny
                           floor. He made us
                           sit down with some courtesy, and in reply to her questions said he was pretty well.
                           Had he slept? He
                           shook his head. Had he eaten? He shrugged his shoulders and then he pointed to the
                           piano. He had
                           been composing somethingâ€”I remember that he spoke in an abrupt, light sort of wayâ€”would
                           Miss X. like

                           answered, 
                           <said id="d74890e817">"of course, she would dearly like to hear it; but it would tire him to play; it
                              could not be good for him."
                           </said> He smiled again, shook back his long hair, and sat down
                           immediately; and then the music began and the room was filled with continuous sound,
                           he looking over
                           his shoulder now and then to see if we were liking it. The lady sat absorbed and listening,
                           and as I
                           looked at her I saw tears in her eyesâ€”great clear tears rolling down her cheeks while
                           the music
                           poured on and on. I can't, alas, recall that music! I would give anything to remember
                           it now; but
                           the truth is, I was so interested in the people that I scarcely listened. When he
                           stopped at last
                           and looked round, the lady started up. 
                           <said id="d74890e820">"You mustn't play any more,"</said> she said; 
                           <said id="d74890e823">"no
                              more, no more, it's too beautiful"
                           </said>â€”and she praised him and thanked him in a tender,
                           motherly, pitying sort of way, and then hurriedly said we must go; but as we took
                           leave she added,
                           almost in a whisper with a humble apologizing lookâ€”
                           <said id="d74890e826">"I have brought you some of that jelly, and
                              my sister sent some of the wine you fancied the other day; pray, pray try to take

                           </said> He again shook his head at her, seeming more vexed than grateful. 
                           <said id="d74890e829">"It is
                              very wrong; you shouldn't bring me these things,"

                           down-stairs she wiped her eyes again. By this time I had got to understand the plain,
                           tall, grim,
                           warm-hearted woman; all my silly terrors were gone. She looked hard at me as we drove
                           away.

                        <p id="d74890e845">Sometimes reading the memoirs of the great musician, the sad story of his early death,
                           of his
                           passionate fidelity, and cruel estrangement from the companion he most loved, I have
                           remembered this
                           little scene with comfort and pleasure, and known that he was not altogether alone
                           in life, and that
                           he had good friends who cared for his genius and tended him to the last. Of their
                           affection he was
                           aware. But of their constant secret material guardianship he was unconscious; the
                           basket he
                           evidently hated, the woman he turned to with most grateful response and dependence.
                           He was to the
                           very end absorbed in his music, in his art, in his love. He had bestowed without counting
                           all that
                           he had to give: he poured it forth upon others, never reckoning the cost; and then
                           dying away from
                           it all, he in turn took what came to him as a child might do, without pondering or
                           speculating
                           overmuch.

                        <p id="d74890e864">I BEGAN life at four or five years old as a fervent Napoleonist. The great emperor
                           had not been dead
                           a quarter of a century when I was a little child. He was certainly alive in the hearts
                           of the French
                           people and of the children growing up among them. Influenced by the cook, we adored
                           his memory, and
                           the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e866" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr"></foreign> had a clock with a laurel wreath which from some reason
                           kindled all our enthusiasm.

                        <p id="d74890e870">As a baby holding my father's finger I had stared at the second funeral of Napoleon
                           sweeping up the
                           great roadway of the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e872" xml:lang="fr">Champs ElysÃ©es</foreign>. The ground was white with
                           new-fallen snow, and I had never seen snow before; it seemed to me to be a part of
                           the funeral, a
                           mighty pall indeed spread for the obsequies of so great a warrior. It was the snow
                           I thought about,
                           though I looked with awe at the black and glittering carriages which came up like
                           ships sailing past
                           us, noiselessly one by one. They frightened me, for I thought there was a dead emperor
                           in each. This
                           weird procession gave a strange importance to the memory <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="32"> </a></span> of the
                           great emperor, and also to the little marble statuette of him on the nursery chimney-piece.
                           It stood
                           with folded arms contemplating the decadence of France, black and silent and reproachful.
                           France was
                           no longer an empire, only a kingdom just like any other country; this fact I and the
                           cook bitterly
                           resented. Besides the statuette there was a snuff-box, belonging I know not to whom,
                           that was a
                           treasure of emotional awe. It came out on Sundays, and sometimes of an evening just
                           before bed-time.
                           At first as you looked you saw nothing but the cover of a wooden box ornamented by
                           a drawing in
                           brown sepia, the sketch of a tombstone and a weeping willow-treeâ€” nothing more. Then
                           if you looked
                           again, indicated by ingenious twigs and lines there gradually dawned upon you the
                           figure, the
                           shadowy figure of him who lay beneath the stone. Napoleon, pale and sad, with folded
                           arms, with his
                           cocked hat crushed forward on his brow, the mournful shade of the conqueror who had
                           sent a million
                           of other men to Hades before him.

                        <p id="d74890e878">As we gazed we hated the English. It is true I was very glad they always conquered
                           everybody, and
                           that my grandpapa was a major in their army; but at the same time the cook and I hated
                           the
                           perfidious English, and we felt that if Napoleon had not been betrayed he would still
                           have been
                           reigning over us here in Paris.

                           <foreign id="d74890e885" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">bonne</foreign> to play
                           round about the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e888" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</foreign> near which we lived, and where,
                           alternating with ornamental rosettes, the long lists of Napoleon's battles and triumphs
                           were carved
                           upon the stone. The 
                           <foreign id="d74890e891" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">bonne</foreign> sat at work upon one of the
                           stone benches which surround the Arc, we made gravel pies on the step at her feet
                           and searched for
                           shells in the sand, or, when we were not prevented by the guardian, swung on the iron
                           chains which
                           divide the enclosure from the road. We paid no attention whatever to the inscriptions,
                           in fact we
                           couldn't read very well in those days. We hardly ever looked at the groups of statuary,
                           except that
                           there was one great arm carrying a shield, and a huge leg like the limb in the Castle
                           of Otranto
                           which haunted us, and which we always saw, though we tried 
                           <hi id="d74890e894" style="font-style: italic;">not</hi> to see it. I never
                           remember being very light-hearted or laughing at my play up by the Arc, a general
                           sense of something
                           grim and great and strange and beyond my small ken impressed itself upon me as we
                           played. When I had
                           night-mares at night the Arc de Triomphe, with its writhing figures, was always mixed
                           up with them.
                           One day the guardian in his brass buttons, being in a good humor, allowed us all to
                           climb up without
                           paying to the flat lead terrace on the top. There were easy steps inside the walls,
                           and slits <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="33"> </a></span> for light at intervals; and when we climbed the last steep step
                           and came out upon the summit, we saw the great view, the domes and the pinnacles and
                           gilt
                           weathercocks of the lovely city all spreading before us, and the winding river, and
                           the people
                           looking like grains of sand blown by the wind, and the carriages crawling like insects,
                           and the
                           palace of the Tuileries in its lovely old gardens shining like a toy. But somehow
                           the world from a
                           monumental height is quite different from what it seems from a curb-stone, where much
                           more human
                           impressions are to be found; and that disembodied Paris, spreading like a vision,
                           never appeared to
                           me to be the same place as the noisy, cheerful, beloved city of my early childish
                           recollections.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e900">The first house in which we lived at Paris was an old house in an old avenue enclosed
                           by iron gates
                           which were shut at night. It was called the Avenue Sainte Marie and led from the Faubourg
                           du Roule
                           to the Arc de Triomphe. The avenue was planted with shady trees; on one side there
                           were houses, on
                           the other convent walls. At the door of one of the houses an old man sat in his chair,
                           who used to
                           tell us, as we passed by, that in a few months he would be a hundred years old, and
                           then they would
                           put him into the papers. I used to play in the court-yard belonging to the house in
                           which <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span> we lived. There was a pump and there was a wall with a row of poplar
                           trees beyond it. There was a faded fresco painted on the wall, a dim fountain, a pale
                           Italian
                           garden, a washed-out bird flying away, with a blue tail, across long streaks of mildew
                           that had come
                           from the drippings of the trees. Frescos must have been in fashion at the time when
                           the Avenue
                           Sainte Marie was built,for there was also a dim painting on the convent wall opposite
                           our 
                           <foreign id="d74890e904" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochÃ¨re</foreign>, representing a temple in a garden, and clouds,
                           and another bird with outstretched wings. From beyond this wall we used to hear the
                           bells and the
                           litanies of the nuns. One night I dreamed that I was walking in the convent garden
                           and that my
                           father came out of the temple to fetch me home, and that the bird flapped its wings
                           with a shrill
                           cry. I used to dream a great deal when I was a little child, and then wake up in my
                           creaking wooden
                           bed and stare at the dim floating night-light like a little ship on its sea of oil.
                           Then from the
                           dark corners of the room there used to come all sorts of strange things sailing up
                           upon the
                           darkness. I could see them all, looking like painted pictures. There were flowers,
                           birds, dolls,
                           toys, shining things of every description. I have since heard that this seeing pictures
                           in the dark
                           is not an uncommon faculty among children. I had a vague feeling that the pictures
                           came from the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="42" data-tei-n="36"> </a></span> house of the nuns. My sister being a baby, I had only the porter's
                           niece to play with. She was older than I was, and used to go to school at the convent.
                           She used to
                           wear a black stuff pinafore and a blue ribbon with the image of the Virgin round her
                           neck. As we
                           played we could hear other music than that of the nuns, the brilliant strains of Monsieur
                           Ernest's
                           piano in the apartment over ours. He was a kind young man, very fond of children,
                           who used to open
                           the window and play to us brilliant dances and marches, which we delighted in. When
                           he ceased we
                           went back to our games.

                        <p id="d74890e910">It was later in life that with the help, either of Justine or another relation of
                           the family, I tried
                           to polish up the stairs as a surprise for the porter on his return from an errand.
                           We got the long
                           brooms and sticks out of the lodge where there was nobody to be seen, only an odd
                           smell and a great
                           pot simmering by the fire. One of us carried a feather broom, the other a brush with
                           a strap to it,
                           and a great stick with a bit of wax at one end. Then we set to work, not forgetting
                           the hissing
                           sound. Justine flapped about with the feather broom and duster; I tried to work my
                           foot with the
                           heavy brush; but the brush flies off, down I come on my nose with a scream, the broom
                           clatters
                           echoing down the stairs, the waxed stick falls over the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="37"> </a></span>
                           bannisters, doors open, voices are heard, I have thumped my nose, bumped my forehead,
                           but I do not
                           mind the painâ€”the disgrace, the failure, are what are so terrible to bear!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e916">I cannot clearly remember when I became an Orleanist, but I think I must have been
                           about six years
                           old at the time, standing tiptoe on the aforesaid curb-stone. My grandmother had changed
                           her cook
                           and her apartment, and I had happened to hear my grandfather say that Napoleon was
                           a rascal who had
                           
                           <hi id="d74890e918" style="font-style: italic;">not</hi> been betrayed by the English. Then came a dayâ€”shall I ever forget it?â€”when
                           a yellow carriage jingled by with a beautiful little smiling boy at the window, a
                           fair-haired,
                           blue-eyed prince. It was the little Comte de Paris, who would be a king some day,
                           they told me, and
                           who was smiling and looking so charming that then and there I deserted my colors and
                           went over to
                           the camp of the Orleans. Alas! that the lilies of France should have been smirched
                           and soiled by
                           base and vulgar intrigues, and that my little prince should have stepped down unabashed,
                           as a
                           gray-headed veteran, from the dignified shrine of his youth. I remember once hearing
                           my father say
                           of the Duc d'Aumale, "He has everything in his favorâ€”good looks, dignity, fine manners,
                           intellect,
                           riches, and, above all, misfortune;" and with all of these I invested the image of
                           my own particular
                           little prince.

                           butchers, when the fat ox, covered with garlands and with gilded horns, is led to
                           sacrifice through
                           the streets of Paris, I also, to my great satisfaction, was brought forth to join
                           the procession by
                           a couple of maids, one of whom carried a basket. I remember finding my stumpy self
                           in a court of the
                           Tuileries, the fairy ox having been brought thither for the benefit of the king, and
                           I was hustled
                           to the front of a crowd and stood between my two protectors looking up at a window.
                           Then comes an
                           outcry of cheering, and a venerable, curly-headed old gentleman, Louis Philippe himself,
                           just like
                           all his pictures, appears for an instant behind the glass, and then the people shout
                           again and
                           again, and the window opens, and the king steps out on to the balcony handing out
                           an old lady in a
                           bonnet and frizzed white curls, and, yes, the little boy is there too. Hurrah, hurrah!
                           for all the
                           kings and queens! And somebody is squeezing me up against the basket, but I am now
                           an Orleanist and
                           ready to suffer tortures for the kind old grandpapa and the little boy. Now that I
                           am a gray-headed
                           woman I feel as if I could still stand in the crowd and cry hurrah for honest men
                           who, with old
                           Louis Philippe, would rather give up their crowns than let their subjects be fired
                           upon; and if my

                           had kept to his grandfather's peaceful philosophy, I could have cried hurrah for him

                           my heart.

                           put up for
                           other people, and moralized a little bit before proceeding to amuse ourselves with
                           our own
                           adventures further on. As I have said, the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e934" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</foreign> seems
                           mixed up with all my early life. I remember looking up at it on my way to my first
                           school in an
                           adjoining street, crossing the open space, and instead of stopping to pick up shells
                           as usual,
                           casting, I dare say, a complaisant glance of superiority at the gods of war in their
                           stony chariots,
                           who, after all, never had much education. I was nicely dressed in a plaid frock, and
                           wore two tails
                           of hair tied with ribbons, a black apron, and two little black pantalettes. It was
                           the admired
                           costume of all the young ladies of the school to which I was bound. On this occasion
                           the stony gods
                           witnessed my undue elation and subsequent discomfiture unmoved. The triumphal arch
                           was certainly not
                           intended for my return. I was led home that evening, after a day mostly spent in the
                           corner,
                           crestfallen and crushed by my inferiority to all the other young ladies of the school
                           in their black
                           pinafores and pantalettes.

                           things.
                           There were also merry-makings to be remembered. Did not the Siamese Twins themselves
                           set up their
                           booths in its shadow in company with various wild Bedouins their companions? I thought
                           it cruel of
                           the nurse not to take me in to see the show, and indeed on one occasion I ran away
                           from home to
                           visit it on my own account. The expedition was not a success, but Siam has always
                           seemed to me an
                           interesting country ever since. Besides the twins and their booth, there were cafds
                           and
                           resting-places in those days all round about the Arc, and people enjoying themselves
                           after their
                           long day's work with song and laughter. Wild flowers were still growing at the upper
                           end of the

                           It was a year of catastrophes and revolutionsâ€”a sort of "General Post" among kings
                           and governments.
                           Many of the promenaders (my grandparents among then) used to wear little tricolor
                           rosettes to show
                           their sympathies with the Republic. Shall I ever forget the sight of the enthusiastic

                           before, and, what is even more vivid to my mind, a charming empress presently rose
                           before us,
                           winning all hearts by her grace and her beautiful toilettes. My sister and I stood
                           by the roadside
                           on her wedding-day and watched her carriage rolling past the Arc to St. Cloud; the
                           morning had been
                           full of spring sunshine, but the afternoon was bleak and drear, and I remember how
                           we shivered as we
                           stood. Some years later, when we were no longer little girls, but young ladies in
                           crinolines, we
                           counted the guns fired for the birth of the Prince Imperial at the Tuileries.

                           hopeless chaos
                           in our minds, reaching as far back as the times of Charlemagne and Clovis, and Bertha
                           with the long
                           foot, and Fredegonde who was always plunging her dagger into somebody's back. The
                           early Merovingians
                           will for me ever be associated with a faint smell of snuff and a plaid linen pocket-handkerchief
                           carefully folded, with a little, old, short, stumpy figure, in a black cap and dressed
                           in a scanty
                           black skirt. The figure is that of my Professor of History. An old, old lady, very
                           short, very
                           dignified, uttering little grunts at intervals, and holding a pair of spectacles in
                           one hand and a
                           little old black fat book in the other, from which, with many fumblings and snuff-takings

                           sudden death, of kings, crowns, dynasties, and knights in armor, while we, her pupils,
                           listened,
                           trying not to laugh when she turned two pages at once, or read the same page twice

                           five-franc tickets of admission to the course, should be given by her during the winter

                           where the Major
                           meanwhile had been able to enjoy his after-dinner nap in quiet. He refused to attend
                           the course,
                           saying, after the first lecture, that he found it difficult to follow the drift of
                           Madame's
                           arguments. There used to be a class of four girlsâ€”my sister and myself, our cousin
                           Amy, and Laura
                           C., a friend of my own ageâ€”and then the various ladies, in bonnets; from up-stairs
                           and down-stairs
                           and next door. The lecture lasted an hour by the clock; then the meeting suddenly
                           adjourned, and by

                           ten everybody was already walking down the shiny staircase and starting for home.
                           Paris streets at
                           night may be dark and muddy, or freezing cold, but they never give one that chill,
                           vault-like
                           feeling which London streets are apt to produce when one turns out from a warm fireside
                           into the raw
                           night. The ladies thought nothing of crossing the road and walking along a boulevard
                           till they
                           reached their own doors. Good old Madame used to walk off with those of her pupils
                           who lived her
                           way; they generally left her at the bright chemist's shop round the corner, where
                           Madame Marlin, the
                           chemist's wife, would administer an evening dose of peppermint-water to keep out the
                           coldâ€”so we used
                           to be told by Madame. The old lady lived in one of the tall, shabby houses at the
                           top of the
                           Faubourg, just behind the Arc. We used to find her sitting in a small crowded room,
                           with a tiny
                           ante-room, and an alcove for her bed. There she lived with her poodle, Bibi, among
                           the faded
                           treasures and ancient snuff-boxes and books and portraits and silhouettes of a lifetime;
                           grim
                           effigies of a grim past somewhat softened by dust and time. In the midst of all the
                           chaos one lovely
                           miniature used to hang, shining like a star through the clouds of present loneliness
                           and the
                           spiders' webs of age and poverty. This was the portrait of the beautiful Lady Almeria
                           Carpenter, the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="48"> </a></span> friend of Sir Joshua, with whom in some mysterious, romantic
                           way Madame was connected. Another equally valued relic was a needlebook which had
                           been used by the
                           
                           <foreign id="d74890e1009" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse de Praslin</foreign> on the day when her husband murdered her.
                           Madame's sister had been governess there for many years, and had loved the duchess
                           dearly and been
                           valued by her, and many and mysterious were the confidences poured into my grandmother's
                           ear
                           concerning this sad tragedy. Our cheery, emphatic, mysterious old lady was very popular
                           among us
                           all. One of her kindest friends was my father's cousin, Miss R., who had lived in
                           Paris all her
                           life, and whose visiting-list comprised any one in trouble or poor or lonely and afflicted.
                           I think
                           if it had not been for her help and that of my grandmother our good old friend would
                           have often gone
                           through sore trials. When my father himself came to Paris to fetch us away, he was
                           interested in the
                           accounts he heard of the old lady from his mother and cousin. And Madame is the heroine
                           of a little
                           story which I have seen in print somewhere, and which I know to be true, for was I
                           not sent one day
                           to search for a certain pill-box in my father's room, of which he proceeded to empty
                           the contents
                           into the fireplace, and then, drawing a neat banker's roll from his pocket, to fill
                           up the little
                           cube with a certain number of new napoleons, packing them in closely up to the brim.

                        <p id="d74890e1020">P.S. The remembrance of this pill-box, and of my father's kind hands packing up the
                           napoleons, came
                           to me long after at a time when misfortunes of every kind had fallen upon the familiar
                           friends and
                           places of our early youth, when the glare of burning Paris seemed to reach us far
                           away in our
                           English homes, and we almost thought we could hear the thunders breaking on the unhappy
                           city. We
                           thought of our poor old lady, alone with her dear Bibi, in the midst of all this terror
                           and
                           destruction. As we sat down to our legs of mutton we pictured the horrible 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1022" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">salmis</foreign> and

                           mice to which our neighbors were reduced, the sufferings so heroically borne. Every
                           memory of the
                           past rose up to incite us to make some effort to come to the assistance of our poor
                           old friend; and
                           at last it occurred to me to ask Baroness Mayer de Rothschild, who was always ready
                           with good help
                           for others, whether it would be possible to communicate with my besieged old lady.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1029">I do not know by what meansâ€”perhaps if I knew, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="56" data-tei-n="50"> </a></span> I ought not to say
                           how communications had been established between the English Rothschilds and those
                           who were still in
                           Paris. Some trusty and devoted retainer, some Porthos belonging to the house, had
                           been able to get
                           into Paris carrying letters and messages and food, and he was, so the Baroness now
                           told me, about to
                           return again. By this means I was told that I might send my letters and a draft on
                           the bank in Paris
                           so that poor Madame could obtain a little help of which she must be in cruel need;
                           and this being
                           accomplished, the letter written and the money sent off, I was able with an easier
                           mind to enjoy my
                           own share of the good things of life. Time passed, the siege was raised, and then
                           came a day when,
                           urged by circumstances, and perhaps also by a certain curiosity, I found myself starting
                           for Paris
                           with a friend, under the escort of Mr. Cook, arriving after a night's journey through
                           strange and
                           never-to-be- forgotten experiences at the Gare du Nordâ€”a deserted station among streets
                           all empty
                           and silent. Carriages were no longer to be seen, every figure was dressed in black,
                           and the women's
                           sad faces and long, floating crape veils seemed strangely symbolical and visionary,
                           as I walked
                           along to the house of my father's cousin, Charlotte R., who had been my friend ever
                           since I could
                           remember. She was expecting me in her home to which she had <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span> only
                           been able to return a few days before. It is not my purpose here to describe the strange
                           and
                           pathetic experiences and the sights we saw together during that most eventful week;
                           the sunshine of
                           it all, the smoking ruins, the piteous histories, the strange rebound of life even
                           in the midst of
                           its ashes. The Arc itself was wrapped in sack-cloth to preserve the impassive gods
                           from the injuries
                           of war. The great legs and arms we packed in straw and saw-dust to protect them. One
                           of my first
                           questions was for Madame. 
                           <said id="d74890e1035">"She is particularly well,"</said> said my cousin, smiling.

                           and
                           satisfaction at the trouble I had taken on her behalf. I hoped to have saved her life;
                           at all events
                           I felt that she must owe many little comforts to my exertions, and that her grateful

                           awaited me!

                           in. The room smelt of snuff just as usual; Bibi leaped up from her lap, barking furiously.
                           
                           <said id="d74890e1055">"Ah! my dear child,"</said> said the old lady calmly,

                           by chance one
                           meets a whole country suffering from one over-powering idea, and when one hears the

                           to the sale of his
                           books, or even to the degree of their merit; otherwise some might be overpowered by
                           friends, and
                           others remain solitary all their lives long. It also does not always follow that people
                           who write
                           books are those who see most of one another. On the contrary, authors as a rule, I
                           think, prefer
                           play-mates of other professions than their own, and don't keep together in the same
                           way that
                           soldiers do for instance, or dandies, or lawyers, or members of Parliament. Lawyers,
                           politicians,
                           soldiers, and even doctors, do a great deal of their work together in one another's
                           company; but the
                           hours don't suit for literary people, and one rarely hears of five or six authors
                           sitting down in a
                           row to write books. They are generally shut up apart in different studies, with strict
                           orders given
                           that nobody is to be shown in.

                           Caldron, from which rise one by one these figures of the past, and they go by in turn
                           and vanish one
                           by one into the mistâ€”some are kings and queens in their own right,â€” some are friends,
                           some are
                           dependants. From my caldron rise many figures crowned and uncrowned, some of whom
                           I have looked upon
                           once perhaps, and then realized them in after-life from a different point of view.
                           Now, perhaps,
                           looking back, one can tell their worth better than at the time; one knows which were
                           the true
                           companions, which were the teachers and spiritual pastors, which were but shadows
                           after all. The
                           most splendid person I ever remember seeing had a little pencil sketch in his hand,
                           which he left
                           behind him upon the table. It was a very feeble sketch; it seemed scarcely possible
                           that so grand a
                           being should not be a bolder draughtsman. He appeared to us one Sunday morning in
                           the sunshine. When
                           I came down to breakfast I found him sitting beside my father at the table, with an
                           untasted cup of
                           tea before him; he seemed to fill the bow-window with radiance as if he were Apollo;
                           he leaned
                           against his chair with one elbow resting on its back, with shining studs and curls
                           and boots. We
                           could see his horse looking in at us over the blind. It was indeed a sight <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="65" data-tei-n="59"> </a></span> for little girls to remember all their lives. I think my father had a
                           certain weakness for dandies, those knights of the broadcloth and shining fronts.
                           Magnificent
                           apparitions used to dawn upon us in the hall sometimes, glorious beings on their way
                           to the study,
                           but this one outshone them all. I came upon a description in Lord Lamington's 
                           <title id="d74890e1155">Book of
                              Dandies
                           </title> the other day, which once more evoked the shining memory. Our visitor was Count
                           D'Orsay, of whom Lord Lamington says: <q style=" display: inline; ">"When he appeared in the perfection of dress (for the

                              and
                              complacency which the sense of superiority gives, he was the observed of all! In those
                              days men
                              took great pains with themselves, they did not slouch and moon thro' life .... I have
                              frequently
                              ridden down to Richmond with Count D'Orsay; a striking figure he was; his blue coat,
                              thrown well
                              back to show the wide expanse of snowy shirt-front, his buff waistcoat, his light
                              leathers and
                              polished boots, his well-curled whiskers and handsome countenance; a wide-brimmed
                              glossy hat,
                              and spotless white gloves."</q> Mr. Richard Doyle used to tell us a little story of a well-known
                           literary man who was so carried away by the presence of the brilliant D'Orsay at some
                           city banquet
                           that in a burst of enthusiasm he was heard to call aloud, above the din of voices,
                           <q style=" display: inline; ">"Waiter! for

                           triumphant road, nor did his genius fail him to the last. I have read somewhere a
                           curious
                           description of the romantic sarcophagus he finally devised for himself in a sort of
                           temple, a flight
                           of marble steps leading to a marble shrine where he was duly laid when he died, not
                           long after his
                           return to his own country and to the land of his fathers. He is of that race of men
                           who lived in the
                           beginning of the century, magnificent performers of life's commonplaces, representative
                           heroes and
                           leaders of the scene. Byron belonged to the brilliant company, and greatly admired
                           Count D'Orsat.
                           There is a certain absence of the florid, a frozen coldness in the fashion of to-day
                           which strikes

                        <p id="d74890e1168">I remember a visit from another hero of those times. We were walking across Kensington
                           Square early
                           one morning, when we heard some one hurrying after us and calling, 
                           <said id="d74890e1170">"Thackeray,
                              Thackeray!"
                           </said> This was also one of Byron's friendsâ€”a bright-eyed, active old man, with
                           long, wavy white hair, and a picturesque cloak flung over one shoulder. I can see
                           him still, as he
                           crossed the corner of the square and followed us with a light, rapid step. My father,
                           stopping
                           short, turned back to meet him, greeting him kindly, and bringing him home with <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="67" data-tei-n="61"> </a></span> us to the old brown house at the corner where we were then living. There
                           was a sort of eagerness and vividness of manner about the stranger which was very
                           impressive. You
                           could not help watching him and his cloak, which kept slipping from its place, and
                           which he caught
                           at again and again. We wondered at his romantic, foreign looks, and his gayety and
                           bright, eager
                           way. Afterwards we were told that this was Leigh Hunt. We knew his name very well,
                           for on the
                           drawing-room table, in company with various Ruskins and 
                           <title id="d74890e1175">Punches</title>, lay a pretty,
                           shining book called 
                           <title id="d74890e1178">A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla</title>, from which, in that dilettante,
                           childish fashion which is half play, half impatience, and search for something else,
                           we had
                           contrived to extract our own allowance of honey. It was still an event to see a real
                           author in those
                           days, specially an author with a long cloak flung over his shoulder; though, for the
                           matter of that,
                           it is still and always will be an event to see the faces and hear the voices of those
                           whose thoughts
                           have added something delightful to our lives. Not very long afterwards came a different
                           visitor,
                           still belonging to that same company of people. I had thrown open the dining- room
                           door and come in,
                           looking for something, and then I stopped short, for the room was not empty. A striking
                           and somewhat
                           alarming-looking person stood alone by the fireplace with folded arms-â€”a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="68" data-tei-n="62"> </a></span> dark, impressive-looking man, not tall, but broad and brown and
                           weather-beatenâ€”gazing with a sort of scowl at his own reflection in the glass. As
                           I entered he
                           turned slowly and looked at me over his shoulder. This time it was Trelawny, Byron's
                           biographer and
                           companion, who had come to see my father. He frowned, walked deliberately and slowly
                           from the room,
                           and I saw him no more. As I have said, all these people now seem almost like figures
                           out of a fairy
                           tale. One could almost as well imagine Sindbad, or Prince Charming, or the Seven Champions
                           of
                           Christendom dropping in for an hour's chat. But each generation, however matter-of-fact
                           it may be,
                           sets up fairy figures in turn, to wonder at and delight in. I had not then read any
                           of the books
                           which have since appeared, though I had heard my elders talking, and I knew from hearsay
                           something
                           of the strange, pathetic, irrational histories of these by-gone wanderers searching
                           the world for
                           the Golden Fleece and the Enchanted Gardens. These were the only members of that special,
                           impracticable, romantic crew of Argonauts I ever saw, though I have read and reread
                           their histories
                           and diaries so that I seem to know them all, and can almost hear their voices.

                        <p id="d74890e1184">One of the most notable persons who ever came into our old bow-windowed drawing-room

                           little person, whose small hand nevertheless grasped a mighty lever which set all
                           the literary world
                           of that day vibrating. I can still see the scene quite plainly!â€”the hot summer evening,
                           the open
                           windows, the carriage driving to the door as we all sat silent and expectant; my father,
                           who rarely
                           waited, waiting with us; our governess and my sister and I all in a row, and prepared
                           for the great
                           event. We saw the carriage stop, and out of it sprang the active, well-knit figure
                           of young Mr.
                           George Smith, who was bringing Miss BrontÃ« to see our father. My father, who had been
                           walking up and
                           down the room, goes out into the hall to meet his guests, and then, after a moment's
                           delay, the door
                           opens wide, and the two gentlemen come in, leading a tiny, delicate, serious little
                           lady, pale, with
                           fair, straight hair, and steady eyes. She may be a little over thirty; she is dressed
                           in a little
                           barge dress with a pattern of faint green moss. She enters in mittens, in silence,
                           in seriousness;
                           our hearts are beating with wild excitement. This, then, is the authoress, the unknown
                           power whose
                           books have set all London talking, reading, speculating; some people even say our
                           father wrote the
                           booksâ€”the wonderful books. To say that we little girls had been given 
                           <title id="d74890e1188">Jane Eyre</title> to
                           read scarcely represents the facts of the case; to say that we had <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="70" data-tei-n="64"> </a></span>
                           taken it without leave, read bits here and read bits there, been carried away by an
                           undreamed-of and
                           hitherto unimagined whirlwind into things, times, places, all utterly absorbing and
                           at the same time
                           absolutely unintelligible to us, would more accurately describe our states of mind
                           on that summer's
                           evening as we look at Jane Eyreâ€”-the great Jane Eyreâ€”-the tiny little lady. The moment
                           is so
                           breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the occasion, and we
                           all smile as my
                           father stoops to offer his arm, for, genius though she may be, Miss BrontÃ« can barely
                           reach his
                           elbow. My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and stern, specially
                           to forward
                           little girls who wish to chatter. Mr. George Smith has since told me how she afterwards
                           remarked
                           upon my father's wonderful forbearance and gentleness with our uncalled-for incursions
                           into the
                           conversation. She sat gazing at him with kindling eyes of interest, lighting up with
                           a sort of
                           illumination every now and then as she answered him. I can see her bending forward
                           over the table,
                           not eating, but listening to what he said as he carved the dish before him.

                        <p id="d74890e1194">I think it must have been on this very occasion that my father invited some of his
                           friends in the
                           evening to meet Miss BrontÃ«, for everybody was interested and anxious to see her.
                           Mrs. Crowe, the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="71" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span> reciter of ghost-stories, was there. Mrs. Brookfield, Mrs.
                           Carlyleâ€”-Mr. Carlyle himself was present, so I am told, railing at the appearance
                           of cockneys upon
                           Scotch mountain-sides; there were also too many Americans for his taste; <q style=" display: inline; ">"but the Americans were
                              as God compared to the cockneys,"</q> says the philosopher. Besides the Carlyles, there were
                           Mrs. Elliott and Miss Perry, Mrs. Procter and her daughter, most of my father's habitual
                           friends and
                           companions. In the recent life of Lord Houghton I was amused to see a note quoted
                           in which Lord
                           Houghton also was convened. Would that he had been present!â€”perhaps the party would
                           have gone off
                           better. It was a gloomy and a silent evening. Every one waited for the brilliant conversation
                           which
                           never began at all. Miss BrontÃ« retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low
                           word now and
                           then to our kind governess, Miss Truelock. The room looked very dark; the lamp began
                           to smoke a
                           little; the conversation grew dimmer and more dim; the ladies sat round still expectant;
                           my father
                           was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at
                           all. Mrs.
                           Brookfield, who was in the doorway by the study, near the corner in which Miss BrontÃ«
                           was sitting,
                           leaned forward with a little commonplace, since brilliance was not to be the order
                           of the evening.
                           "Do you like London, Miss BrontÃ«?" she said. Another <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="67"> </a></span> silence, a
                           pause; then Miss BrontÃ« answers "Yes" and "No" very gravely. My sister and I were
                           much too young to
                           be bored in those days; alarmed, impressed we might be, but not yet bored. A party
                           was a party, a
                           lioness was a lioness; andâ€”shall I confess it?â€”at that time an extra dish of biscuits
                           was enough to
                           mark the evening. We felt all the importance of the occasionâ€”tea spread in the dining-room,
                           ladies
                           in the drawing-room. We roamed about inconveniently, no doubt, and excitedly; and
                           in one of my
                           excursions crossing the hall, towards the close of the entertainment, I was surprised
                           to see my
                           father opening the front door with his hat on. He put his fingers to his lips, walked
                           out into the
                           darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him. When I went back to the drawing-room
                           again, the
                           ladies asked me where he was. I vaguely answered that I thought he was coming back.
                           I was puzzled at
                           the time, nor was it all made clear to me till long years afterwards, when one day
                           Mrs. Procter
                           asked me if I knew what had happened once when my father had invited a party to meet
                           Jane Eyre at
                           his house. It was one of the dullest evenings she had ever spent in her life, she
                           said. And then
                           with a good deal of humor she described the situationâ€”the ladies who had all come
                           expecting so much
                           delightful conversation, and how as the evening went on the gloom and the constraint
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="73" data-tei-n="67"> </a></span> increased, and how finally, after the' departure of the more important
                           guests, overwhelmed by the situation, my father had quietly left the room, left the
                           house, and gone
                           off to his club. The ladies waited, wondered, and finally departed also; and as we
                           were going up to
                           bed with our candles after everybody was gone, I remember two pretty Miss Lâ€”-s, in
                           shiny silk
                           dresses, arriving, full of expectation . . . We still said we thought our father would
                           soon be back;
                           but the Miss Lâ€”-s declined to wait upon the chance, laughed, and drove away again
                           almost
                           immediately.

                        <p id="d74890e1206">Since writing the preceding lines, I have visited

                           delightful home where she used to stay with Mrs. Gaskell. I have seen signs and tokens
                           of her
                           presence, faint sketches vanishing away, the delicate writing in the beautiful books

                           most touching chap- ter in the never-to-be-written book of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s happy
                           married life.
                           The paper is signed "W. M. T.;" it was written by the editor, and is printed in one

                           honest eyes; an impetuous honesty seemed to me to characterize the woman. .... I fancied
                           an austere
                           little Joan of Arc marching in upon us and rebuking our easy lives, our easy morals.
                           She gave me the
                           impression of being a very pure and lofty and high-minded person. A great and holy
                           reverence of
                           right and truth seemed to be with her always. Such in our brief interview she appeared
                           to me. As one
                           thinks of that life so noble, so lonelyâ€”of that passion for truthâ€”of those nights
                           and nights of
                           eager study, swarming fancies, invention, depression, elation, and prayer; as one
                           reads of the
                           necessarily incomplete though most touching and admirable history of the heart that
                           throbbed in this
                           one little frameâ€”of this one among the myriads of souls that have lived and died on
                           this great
                           earthâ€”this great earth!â€”this little speck in the infinite universe of God, with what
                           wonder do we
                           think of to-day, with what awe await to-morrow, when that which is now but darkly
                           seen shall be
                           clear!

                           harmless enough, neither sweltered venom nor fillet of finny snake, but the back of
                           one great man's
                           head, the hat and umbrella of another. The first time I ever saw Mr. Gladstone I only
                           saw the soles
                           of his boots. A friend had taken me into the ventilator of the House of Commons, where
                           we listened
                           to a noble speech and watched the two shadows on the grating overhead of the feet
                           of the messenger
                           of glad tidings. One special back I cannot refrain from writing down, in a dark blue
                           frock-coat and
                           strapped trousers, walking leisurely before us up Piccadilly. The sun is shining,
                           and an odd sort of
                           brass buckle which fastens an old-fashioned stock, flashes like a star. "Do look!"
                           I say. "Who is
                           that old gentleman?" " That old gentleman ! Why, that is the Duke of Wellington,"
                           said my father. On
                           another occasion I remember some one coming up to us and beginning to talk very charmingly,
                           and
                           among other things describing some new lord mayor who had been in state to a theatrical
                           performance,
                           by which it seemed he had been much affected. "I cried, I do assure you," the lord
                           mayor had said,
                           "and as for the lady mayoress, she cry too;" and the gentleman <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="76" data-tei-n="7o"> </a></span>
                           smiled and told the little story so dryly and drolly that my sister and I couldn't
                           help laughing,
                           and we went on repeating to one another afterwards, "As for the lady mayoress, she
                           cry too." And
                           then as usual we asked who was that. "Don't you know Lord Palmerston by sight?" said

                        <p id="d74890e1234">Another miscellaneous apparition out of my caldron rises before me as I write. On
                           a certain day we
                           went to call at Mrs. Procter's with our father. We found an old man standing in the
                           middle of the
                           room, taking leave of his hostess, nodding his headâ€”he was a little like a Chinese
                           mandarin with an
                           ivory face. His expression never changed, but seemed quite fixed. He knew my father,
                           and spoke to
                           him and to us too, still in this odd, fixed way. Then he looked at my sister. "My
                           little girl," he
                           said to her, "will you come and live with me You shall be as happy as the day is long;
                           you shall
                           have a white pony tor ride, and feed upon red-currant jelly." This prospect was so
                           alarming and
                           unexpected that the poor little girl suddenly blushed up <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="71"> </a></span> and burst
                           into tears. The old man was Mr. Sam- uel Rogers, but happily he did not see her cry,
                           for he was
                           already on his way to the door.

                        <p id="d74890e1239">My father was very fond of going to the play, and he used to take us when we were
                           children, one on
                           each side of him, in a hansom. He used to take us to the opera too, which was less
                           of a treat.
                           Magnificent envelopes, with unicorns and heraldic emblazonments, used to come very
                           frequently,
                           containing tickets and boxes for the opera. In those days we thought everybody had
                           boxes for the
                           opera as a matter of course. We used to be installed in the front places with our
                           chins resting on
                           the velvet ledges of the box. For a time it used to be very delightful, then sometimes
                           I used
                           suddenly to wake up to find the singing still going on and on as in a dream. I can
                           still see
                           Lablache, a huge reverberating mountain, a sort of Olympus, thundering forth glorious
                           sounds, and
                           addressing deep resounding notes to what seemed to me then a sort of fairy in white.
                           She stood on
                           tiny feet, she put up a delicate finger and sent forth a sweet vibration of song in
                           answer, sweeter,
                           shriller, more charming every instant. Did she fly right up into the air, or was it
                           my own head that
                           came down with a sleepy nod? I slept, I awoke; and each time I was conscious of this
                           exquisite
                           floating ripple of music flowing in and out of my dreams. The singer was Mademoiselle

                           lark's carol. All the great golden house applauded; my father applauded. I longed
                           to hear more, but
                           in vain I struggled, I only slumbered again, waking from minute to minute to see the
                           lovely little
                           lady in white still pouring forth her melody to the thousand lights and people. I

                           <hi id="d74890e1262" style="font-style: italic;">imagined</hi> the songs for ourselves as
                           children do. We gathered all our verbenas and geraniums for a nosegay and gave it
                           to our guests to
                           carry, and watched the carriage roll off in the twilight with wild hopes, unexpressed,
                           that perhaps
                           the flowers would be cast upon the stage at the feet of the great singer. But though

                           turned home again crushed and dilapidated, and though we did not hear the song, it
                           was a reality for
                           me, and lasted until a day long years after, when I heard that stately and glorious

                           into my darkness with a shock of amazement never to be forgotten, and then and there

                           he liked to hear
                           his interesting talk about music. Through Mr. Ella's kindness the doors of the Musical
                           Union flew
                           open wide to us.

                        <p id="d74890e1278">My father used to write in his study at the back of the house in Young Street. The
                           vine shaded his
                           two windows, which looked out upon the bit of garden and the medlar-tree and the Spanish
                           jasmines of
                           which the yellow flowers scented our old brick walls. I can remember the tortoise
                           belonging to the
                           boys next door crawling along the top of the wall where they had set it, and making
                           its way between
                           the jasmine sprigs. Jasmines won't grow now any more, as they did then, in the gardens
                           of
                           Kensington, nor will medlars and vine trees take root and spread their green branches;
                           only herbs
                           and bulbs, such as lilies and Solomon's seals, seem to flourish, though I have a faint
                           hope that all
                           the things people put in will come up all right some centuries hence, when London
                           is resting and at
                           peace, and has turned into the grass-grown ruin one so often hears described. Our
                           garden was not
                           tidy (though on one grand occasion a man came <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="81" data-tei-n="75"> </a></span> to mow the grass),
                           but it was full of sweet things. There were verbenas-red, blue, and scented; and there
                           were lovely
                           stacks of flags, blades of green with purple heads between, and bunches of London-pride
                           growing
                           luxuriantly; and there were some blush-roses at the end of the garden which were not
                           always quite
                           eaten up by the caterpillars. Lady Duff Gordon came to stay with us once (it was on
                           that occasion, I
                           think, that the grass was mowed), and she afterwards sent us some doves, which used
                           to hang high up
                           in a wicker cage from the windows of the school-room. The top school- room was over
                           my father's
                           bedroom, and the bed- room was over the study where he used to write. I liked the
                           top school-room
                           the best of all the rooms in the dear old house; the sky was in it, and the evening
                           bells used to
                           ring into it across the garden, and seemed to come in dancing and clanging with the
                           sunset; and the
                           floor sloped so that if you put down a ball it would roll in a leisurely way right
                           across the room
                           of its own accord. And then there was a mysteryâ€”a small trap-door between the windows
                           which we never
                           could open. Where did not that trap-door lead to? It was the gate- way of Paradise,
                           of many
                           paradises to us. We kept our dolls, our bricks, our books, our baby-houses in the
                           top room, and most
                           of our stupid little fancies. My little sister had a menagerie of snails and flies
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="82" data-tei-n="76]"> </a></span> in the sunny window-sill; these latter, chiefly invalids rescued out of
                           milk-jugs, lay upon rose-leaves in various little pots and receptacles. She was very
                           fond of
                           animals, and so was my fatherâ€”at least, he always liked 
                           <hi id="d74890e1284" style="font-style: italic;">our</hi> animals. Now, looking
                           back, I am full of wonder at the number of cats we were allowed to keep, though De
                           la Pluche, the
                           butler, and Gray, the housekeeper, waged war against them. The cats used to come to
                           us from the
                           garden, for then, as now, the open spaces of Kensington abounded in fauna. My sister
                           used to adopt
                           and christen them all in turn by the names of her favorite heroes; she had Nicholas
                           Nickleby, a huge
                           gray tabby, and Martin Chuzzlewit, and a poor little half-starved Barnaby Rudge, and
                           many others.
                           Their saucers used to be placed in a row on the little terrace at the back of my father's
                           study,
                           under the vine where the sour green grapes grewâ€”not at all out of reach; and at the
                           farther end of
                           which was an empty greenhouse ornamented by the busts of my father as a boy, and of
                           a rela- tion in
                           a military cloak.

                        <p id="d74890e1288">One of my friendsâ€”she never lived to be an old womanâ€”used to laugh and say that she
                           had reached the
                           time of life when she loved to see even the people her parents had particularly disliked,
                           just for
                           the sake of old times. I don't know how I should feel if I were to meet one agreeable,
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="83" data-tei-n="77"> </a></span> cordial gentleman, who used to come on horseback and invite us to all
                           sorts of dazzling treats arid entertainments which, to our great disappointment, my
                           father
                           invariably refused, saying, "No, I don't like him; I don't want to have anything to
                           do with him."
                           The wretched man fully justified these objections by getting himself transported long
                           after for a
                           protracted course of peculiarly deliberate and cold-blooded fraud. On one occasion,
                           a friend told
                           me, he was talking to my father, and mentioning some one in good repute at the time,
                           and my father
                           incidentally spoke as if he knew of a murder that person had committed. "You know
                           it, then!" said
                           the other man. "Who could have told you?" My father had never been told, but he had
                           known it all
                           along, he said; and, indeed, he sometimes spoke of this curious feeling he had about
                           people at
                           times, as if uncomfortable facts in their past history were actually revealed to him.
                           At the same
                           time I do not think anybody had a greater enjoyment than he in other people's goodness
                           and well-
                           doing; he used to be proud of a boy's prizes at school, he used to be proud of a woman's
                           sweet voice
                           or of her success in housekeeping. He had a friend in the Victoria Road hard by whose
                           delightful
                           household ways he used to describe, and I can still hear the lady he called "Jingleby"
                           war- bling
                           
                           <foreign id="d74890e1292" xml:lang="gr">O du schÃ¶ne MÃ¼llerin</foreign>," to his great delight. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="84" data-tei-n="78"> </a></span> Any generous thing or word seemed like something happening to himself. I
                           can remember, when 
                           <title id="d74890e1297">David Copperfield</title> came out, hearing him saying, in his emphatic
                           way, to my grandmother that "little Em'ly's letter to old Peggotty was a masterpiece."
                           I wondered to
                           hear him at the time, for that was not at all the part I cared for most, nor, indeed,
                           could I
                           imagine how little Em'ly ever was so stupid as to run away from Peggotty's enchanted
                           house-boat. But
                           we each and all enjoyed in turn our share of those thin green books full of delicious
                           things, and
                           how glad we were when they came to our hands at last, after our elders and our governess
                           and our
                           butler had all read them in turn.

                        <p id="d74890e1301">It is curious to me now to remember, considering how little we met and what a long
                           way off they
                           lived, what an important part the Dickens household played in our childhood. But the
                           Dickens books
                           were as much a part of our home as our own father's.

                        <p id="d74890e1304">Certainly the Dickens children's parties were shining facts in our early London daysâ€”nothing
                           came in
                           the least near them. There were other partiesâ€”and they were very niceâ€”but nothing
                           to compare to
                           these; not nearly so light, not nearly so shining, not nearly so going round and round.
                           Perhapsâ€”so
                           dear K. P. suggestsâ€”it was not all as brilliantly wonderful as I imagined it; but
                           most assuredly <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span> the spirit of mirth and kindly jollity was a reality to every one
                           present, and the master of the house had that wondrous fairy gift of leadership. I
                           know not what to
                           call that power by which he inspired every one with spirit and interest. One special
                           party I
                           remember, which seemed to me to go on for years with its kind, gay hospitality, its
                           music, its
                           streams of children passing and repassing. We were a little shy coming in alone in
                           all the
                           consciousness of new shoes and ribbons, but Mrs. Dickens called us to sit beside her
                           till the long
                           sweeping dance was over, and talked to us as if we were grown up, which is always
                           flattering to
                           little girls. Then Miss Hogarth found us partners, and we, too, formed part of the
                           throng. I
                           remember watching the white satin shoes and long, flowing white sashes of the little
                           Dickens girls,
                           who were just about our own age, but how much more graceful and beautifully dressed!
                           Our sashes were
                           bright plaids of red and blue (tributes from one of our father's Scotch admirers.
                           Is it ungrateful
                           to confess now after all these years that we could not bear them?), our shoes were
                           only bronze.
                           Shall I own to this passing shadow amid all that radiance? But when people are once
                           dancing they are
                           all equal again and happy.

                        <p id="d74890e1309">Somehow after the music we all floated into a long supper-room, and I found myself
                           sitting near the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span> head of the table by Mr. Dickens, with another little girl
                           much younger than myself; she wore a necklace and pretty little sausage curls all
                           round her head.
                           Mr. Dickens was very kind to the little girl, and presently I heard him persuading
                           her to sing, and
                           he put his arm round her to encourage her; and then, wonderful to say, the little
                           girl stood up (she
                           was little Miss Hullah) and began very shyly, trem- bling and blushing at first, but
                           as she blushed
                           and trembled she sang more and more sweetly; and then all the

                           the supper-table, clapped and clapped, and Mr. Dickens clapped too, smiling and applauding
                           her. And
                           then he made a little speech; with one hand on the table; I think it was thanking
                           the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1316" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse dorÃ©e</foreign> for their applause, and they again clapped and
                           laughed-but here my memory fails me, and everything grows very vague and like a dream.

                        <p id="d74890e1321">Only this much I do remember very clearly, that we had danced and supped and danced

                           we were all standing in a hall lighted and hung with bunches of Christmas green, and,

                           minute, for as the evening went on more and more people kept arriving. The hall was
                           crowded, and the

                           boysâ€”whose heads and legs and arms were waving about together. They were making a
                           great noise, and
                           talking and shouting, and the eldest son of the house seemed to be marshalling them.
                           Presently their
                           noise became a cheer, and then another, and we looked up and saw that our own father
                           had come to
                           fetch us, and that his white head was there above the others; then came a third final
                           ringing cheer,
                           and some one went up to himâ€”it was Mr. Dickens himselfâ€”who laughed and said quickly,
                           "That is for
                           you!" and my father looked up surprised, pleased, touched, settled his spectacles,
                           and nodded
                           gravely to the little boys.

                           varied between a
                           certain fastidiousness and the roughest simplicity. We had shabby table-cloths, alternating
                           with
                           some of my grandmother's fine linen; we had old Derby china for our dessert of dried
                           figs and dry
                           biscuits, and a silver Flaxman teapot (which always poured oblations of tea upon the
                           cloth) for
                           breakfast, also three cracked cups and saucers of unequal patterns and sizes. One
                           morning, Jeames de
                           la Pluche (so my father's servant and factotum chose to call himself when he wrote
                           to the papers)
                           brought in a hamper which had just arrived. When it was unpacked we found, to our
                           great
                           satisfaction, that it contained a lovely breakfast array: A china bowl for my father's
                           tea,
                           ornamented with his initials in gold amid a trellis of roses; beautiful cups for the
                           young ladies,
                           lovely gilt milk-jugs, and a copy of verses, not written, but put together out of
                           printed letters
                           from the Times. I quote it from memory:

                           For many
                           breakfasts we speculated and wondered, guessing one person and another in turn, while
                           we sat at our
                           now elegant board, of which Dr. Oliver Holmes himself might have approved. Years afterwards,
                           when De
                           la Pluche was taking leave of my father and sailing for Australia, where he obtained
                           a responsible
                           position, he said, reproachfully: "I sent you the breakfast things; you guessed a
                           great many people,
                           but ybu never guessed they came from me."

                        <p id="d74890e1383">De la Pluche was devoted to my father, and next to him he seemed the most important
                           member of the
                           household. He was more than devoted. We used to think he was a sorcerer. He used to
                           guess at my
                           father's thoughts, plan for him, work for him, always knew beforehand what he would
                           like far better
                           than we ever did. I remember that we almost cried on one occasion, thinking that our
                           father would
                           ultimately prefer him to us. He used to write to the papers and sign his letters,
                           "Jeames de la
                           Pluche, 13 Young Street." "Like to see my last, miss?" he used to say, as he put down
                           a paper on the
                           school-room table. He was a very good and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="93" data-tei-n="87"> </a></span> clever man, though a
                           stern ruler. My father had a real friendship and regard for him, and few of his friends
                           ever
                           deserved it more. He 'lived alone down-stairs, where he was treated with great deference,
                           and had
                           his meals served separately, I believe. He always called my father "the Governor."
                           He was a little
                           man, and was very like Holbein's picture of Sir Thomas More in looks. I remember on
                           one occasion
                           coming away from some lecture or entertainment. As we got out into the street it was
                           raining. "It
                           has turned cold," said my father, who was already beginning to be ill. At that moment
                           a voice behind
                           him said, " Coat, sir? Brought it down;" and there was De la Pluche, who had brought
                           his coat all
                           the way from Kensington, helping him on with it. My father thanked him, and then mechanically
                           felt
                           in the pocket for a possible cigar-case. " Cigar? Here," says De la Pluche, popping
                           one into my
                           father's mouth, and producing a match ready lighted.

                        <p id="d74890e1391">When we were children attending our classes we used to be encouraged to study large
                           sheets with
                           colored designs, representing the solar system and its various intricacies. One can
                           understand the
                           pictures in the book while one is looking at them, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span> but it is a
                           very different thing from looking at pictures to try to understand the reality as
                           it exists outside
                           the print, and to stand on one's own door- step trying to realize that the earth is
                           turning one way
                           and the moon corkscrewing round it, and the planets dancing their mighty course, and
                           the fixed stars
                           disappearing all the time behind the opposite roof, to say nothing of a possibility
                           that one's feet
                           are up in the air and one's head hanging down below, without any feeling of inconvenience,
                           except,
                           perhaps, a certain bewilderment and confusion on most subjects, which may, however,
                           be peculiar to
                           myself. And so, looking back at one's own life, it is difficult to fit all the events
                           and
                           chronologies quite accurately into their places. If one tries to realize too much
                           at once, the
                           impression is apt to grow chaotic and unmeaning in its complexity; you can't get the
                           proportions of
                           events; and perhaps, indeed, one of the compensating constituents of all our various
                           existences
                           consists in that disproportion which passing impressions happily take for us, and
                           which they often
                           retain notwithstanding the experiences of years.

                           had been
                           surprised to hear from his friend Sir Henry Davison how seriously our house struck
                           people, com-
                           pared to other houses: "But I think we are very happy as we are," said he, and so,
                           indeed, we were.
                           We lived chiefly with him and with quite little children, or with our grandparents
                           when they came
                           over to visit us. There was certainly a want of initiation; in our house there was
                           no one to suggest
                           all sorts of delightful possibilities, which, as we grew up, might have been made
                           more of; but
                           looking back I chiefly regret it in so far as I think he might have been happier if
                           we had brought a
                           little more action and sunshine into daily life, and taken a little more on our own
                           responsibility
                           instead of making ourselves into his shadows.

                        <p id="d74890e1405">When my father had done his day's work he liked a change of scene and thought. I think
                           he was always
                           glad to leave the ink-blots for his beloved dabs of paint. Sometimes he used to drive
                           into town on
                           the top of an omnibus, sometimes in a brougham; very often he used to take us with
                           him in hansoms
                           (which we much preferred) on long expeditions to Hampstead, to Richmond, to Greenwich,
                           or to studios

                           turn over;
                           indeed, the drawings were so accurate, delicate, and suggestive that they used to
                           make one almost
                           giddy to look at. Once or twice we went to Mr. Cattermole's, who had a studio among
                           the Hampstead
                           hills, hidden among ancient walls and ivy-trees. Mr. Du Maurier was not yet living
                           there, or I am
                           sure we should have driven farther up the hill. As life goes on one grudges that time
                           and chance
                           alone should have separated people who would have been so happy with each other. Sometimes
                           we used
                           to go to Sir Edwin Landseer's beautiful villa in St. John's Wood, and enjoy his delightful
                           company.
                           Among his many stories, as he stood painting at his huge canvases, I remember his
                           once telling us an
                           anecdote of one of his dogs. He was in the habit of taking it out every day after
                           his work was
                           over.. The dog used to wait patiently all day long while Sir Edwin was painting, but
                           he used to come
                           and lie down at his feet and look up in his face towards five o'clock; and on one
                           occasion, finding
                           his hints disregarded, he trotted into the hall and came back with the painter's hat,
                           which he laid
                           on the floor before him. Then we always enjoyed going on to the house of a neighbor
                           of Sir Edwin's,
                           Mr. Charles Leslie, who dwelt somewhere in that locality with a delightful <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="97" data-tei-n="91"> </a></span> household. To say nothing of the actual members of that painter's home,
                           there were others also belonging to it who were certainly all but alive. I can still
                           see my father
                           standing in the South Kensington Museum, sympathetic and laughing before the picture
                           of Sancho
                           Panza, in which he sits with his finger to his nose, with that look of portentous
                           wisdom and
                           absurdity. As for the charming duchess, whose portrait is also to be seen, she, or
                           her prototypes,
                           must surely have dwelt in the painter's own home. Mr. Dickens used to be at the Leslies'
                           sometimes,
                           and though I cannot quite account for it, I have a general impression of fireworks
                           perpetually going
                           off just outside their windows.

                        <p id="d74890e1412">One day that we had come home from one of these expeditions in a big blue fly, with
                           a bony horseâ€”it
                           was a.bright blue fly, with a drab inside to it, and an old white coachman on the
                           boxâ€”my father,
                           after a few words of consultation with the coachman, drove off again, and shortly
                           afterwards
                           returning on foot, told us that he had just bought the whole concern, brougham and
                           horse and
                           harness, and that he had sent Jackson (our driver.had now become Jackson) to be measured
                           for a
                           great-coat. So henceforward we came and went about in our own private carriage, which,
                           however,
                           never lost its original name of "the fly," although Jackson's <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="92"> </a></span>
                           buttons shone resplendent with the Thackeray crest, and the horse, too, seemed brushed
                           up and
                           promoted to be private.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1417">I remember, or I think I remember, driving in this vehicle to Mr. Frank Stone's studio
                           in Tavistock
                           Square, and how he and my father began laughing and talking about early days. "Do
                           you remember that
                           portrait I began to paint of you over the lady with the guitar?" Mr. Stone said, and
                           he added that
                           he had the picture still, and, going into some deep cupboard, he brought out a cheerful,
                           florid
                           picture of my father as I for one had never seen him, with thick black hair and a
                           young, ruddy face.
                           We brought it away with us, and I have it now, and the lady's red dress still appears
                           in the
                           background. It is perhaps fortunate that people, as a rule, are well and happy, and
                           at their best,
                           when their portraits are painted. If one looks down the Academy list year by year,
                           one sees that the
                           pictures represent gentlemen who have just been made bishops, or speakers, or governors-general;
                           or
                           ladies who are brides in their lovely new clothes and jewels. Sad folks hide their
                           heads, sick folks
                           turn them away and are not fit subjects for the painter's art; and yet, as I write,
                           I am also
                           conscious that facts contradict me, and that there has been a fine run of late upon
                           nurses and
                           death-bed scenes in general.

                        <p id="d74890e1422">The happy hour had not yet come for us when Mr. Watts came to live in Kensington at
                           Little Holland
                           House, and built his studios there. This was in later times, and after we had just
                           passed beyond the
                           great pinafore age, which sets such a stamp upon after-life, and to which my recollections
                           seem
                           chiefly to revert.

                        <p id="d74890e1426">He always said that he should like to paint a picture of my father, but the day for
                           the sitting,
                           alas, never came. And yet I can imagine what that picture might have beenâ€”a portrait,
                           such as some
                           portraits, with that mysterious reality in them, that 
                           <hi id="d74890e1428" style="font-style: italic;">present</hi>, which is quite
                           apart from time and dates.

                        <p id="d74890e1432">I am sure there was no one among all his friends whose society my father enjoyed more
                           than he did
                           that of John Leech, whom he first remembered, so he has often told us with a smile,
                           a small boy at
                           the Charterhouse, in a little blue buttoned-up suit, set up on a form and made to
                           sing "Home, Sweet
                           Home" to the others crowding round about. Mr. Leech was anything but a small boy when
                           I remember him
                           in the old Young Street dining-room, where De la Pluche was laying the cloth while
                           Mr. Leech and my
                           father sat talking by the fire. He was very handsome and tall, and kind and shy, and
                           he spoke in a
                           husky, melodious voice; we admired him very much; he was always beautifully dressed,
                           and we used to
                           see him come riding up to the door on nice <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="100" data-tei-n="94"> </a></span> shining horses; and he
                           generally came to invite us all to something delightful, to go there or to dine with
                           him and his
                           wife at Richmond or elsewhere. My father liked to take us about with him, and I am
                           surprised, as I
                           think of it, at the great good-nature of his friends, who used so constantly to include
                           two
                           inconvenient little girls in the various invitations they sent him. We used to be
                           asked early, and
                           to arrive at all sorts of unusual times. We used to lunch with our hosts and spend
                           long afternoons,
                           and then about dinner-time our father would come in, and sit smoking after dinner
                           while we waited
                           with patient ladies up-stairs. Mrs. Brookfield used to live in Portman Street in those
                           days, and
                           thither we used to go very frequently, and to Mrs. Procter's, as well as to various
                           relations'
                           houses, Indian cousins of my father's coming to town for a season with their colonels
                           and their
                           families. Time after time we used to go to the Leeches, who lived in Brunswick Square.
                           We used to
                           play with the baby, we used to turn over endless books of pictures, and perhaps go
                           out for a walk
                           with kind Mrs. Leech, and sometimes (but this happened very rarely) we used to be
                           taken up to the
                           room where John Leech himself sat at his drawing-table under the square of silver
                           paper which
                           softened the light as it fell upon his blocks. There was his back as he bent over
                           his work, there
                           were the tables loaded <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="101" data-tei-n="95"> </a></span> with picture-books and drawing-blocks, huge
                           blocks, four times the size of any at home, ready for next week's 
                           <title id="d74890e1438">Punch</title>; but our
                           entrance disturbed him (we instinctively felt how much), and we used to hurry quickly
                           back to the
                           drawing-books down-stairs, and go on turning over the pencil sketches. I have some
                           of them now,
                           those drawings so roughly indicated, at first so vague, and then by degrees worked
                           upon and altered
                           and modelled and forced into their life as it were, 
                           <hi id="d74890e1441" style="font-style: italic;">obliged</hi> to laugh, charmed into
                           kindly wit; as I look at them now, I still recognize the aspect of those by-gone days
                           and places,
                           and I cannot help thinking how much more interesting to remember are some of the shabby
                           homes in
                           which work and beauty and fun are 
                           <hi id="d74890e1444" style="font-style: italic;">made</hi>, than those more luxurious and elaborate,
                           which dazzle us so much more at the time, where everything one saw was only bought.
                           But, after all,
                           the whole secret of life is made up of the things one makes, and those one steals,
                           and those one
                           pays for.

                        <p id="d74890e1448">My own children turn over Leech's drawings now, as happily as we ourselves used to
                           do, and it seems
                           to me sometimes as if they also are at play among our own old fancies and in our old
                           haunts. There
                           are the rooms again. There is Mrs. Leech's old piano like an organ standing bolt upright
                           against the
                           wall; there are the brown-holland covers on the chairs; there is the domestic lamp,
                           looking (as the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="102" data-tei-n="96"> </a></span> lamps of one's youth used to look) tall and dismantled like
                           some gaunt light-house erected upon bare mahogany rocks. Besides these things, I remember
                           with real
                           affection a lovely little miniature portrait of Mrs. Leech, which used to hang upon
                           the wall, and
                           which was done at the time of her marriage. It was indeed the sweetest little picture;
                           and when I
                           saw her one little granddaughter, Dorothy Gillett, this old favorite picture of my
                           childhood came
                           into my mind. It may be hallucination, but, although the houses were so ugly in those
                           days, I still
                           think the people in them looked almost nicer then than they do now.

                           draperies. They
                           are all to be seen in Mr. Leech's pictures still, and they may be about to come back
                           to life,
                           crinolines and all, for anything I know to the contrary. But I hope not; I think this
                           present
                           generation of women is a happier one than that one was. The characters of the people
                           I remember were
                           certainly different from the characters of their daughters of the present, disporting
                           themselves in
                           the golden Du Maurier age of liberty and out-door life. Mr. Leech once drew our own
                           green curtains
                           for us in a little picture of two girls asking a child what it <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="103" data-tei-n="97"> </a></span> for
                           dinner The child says, "Something that begins with a S"; and when asked what that

                           that it was

                           <title id="d74890e1460">Punch</title> used to dine at Mr. Leech's, coming in with my father toward the close of
                           the day. I remember Mr. Tenniel there, and Mr. Percival Leigh, and Mr. Shirley Brookers,
                           and Millais
                           in later days, and an eminent member of a different profession, the rent Dean of Rochester.

                           which they
                           afterwards removed), we used to be taken all away to Richmond, to enjoy happy hours
                           upon the
                           terrace, and the light of setting suns.

                        <p id="d74890e1464">My father was pleased when some dozen years later the Leeches came to Kensington,
                           and he was greatly
                           interested in their pretty old house. Mr. Leech was pleased too; and at first he used
                           to describe
                           with resigned humor what, alas, became slow torture in the end to his strained nervesâ€”
                           the different
                           noises as they succeeded each other in what he had expected to find a quiet suburb
                           of London: the
                           milkman, the carrier, the industrious carpenter, all following in rotation one by
                           one, from the very
                           earliest morning. But his nerves were altogether overstrung. I remember hearing <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="98"> </a></span> him once, in far, far back times, tell a little story, scarcely perhaps
                           worth retelling. He was looking altogether ill and upset, and he told us that he had
                           hardly
                           recovered from a little shock the night before. Coming home late, and as he went up-
                           stairs, he had
                           been annoyed by hearing the howling of a dog in a garden at the back of the house.
                           He did not know
                           that one of his young sisters had come to see his wife that evening, had been persuaded
                           to stay for
                           the night, and put to sleep in the very room into which he now turned, throwing up
                           the window to see
                           where the noise came from. The moon was shining, and happening to look round he was
                           quite overcome,
                           seeing a figure lying motionless upon the bed, while the light poured coldly upon
                           a white marble
                           profile.

                        <p id="d74890e1469">I was going along the Kensington Road towards Palace Green one fine morning, when
                           I met my father
                           carefully carrying before him two blue Dutch china pots, which he had just surreptitiously
                           taken
                           away out of his own study. "I am going to see if they won't stand upon Leech's dining-room
                           chimney-piece," he said. I followed him, hoping, I am afraid, that they would not
                           stand there, for
                           we were well used to lament the accustomed disap- pearance of his pretty ornaments
                           and china dishes.
                           People may have stared to see him carrying his china, but that I do not now rememberâ€”only
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="105" data-tei-n="99"> </a></span> this, that he was amused and interested, and that we found the iron gates
                           open to the court in front, and the doors of the Leeches' house all wide open, though
                           the house
                           itself was empty and the family had not yet arrived. Workmen were coming and going,
                           lbusy hammering
                           carpets and making arrangements. We crossed the hall, and then my father led the way
                           into the
                           pretty, old dining-room, with its new Turkey carpet and its tall windows looking to
                           the gardens at
                           the back. "I knew they would stand there," said he, putting up the two blue pots on
                           the high narrow
                           ledge; and there to my mind they will ever stand.

                        <p id="d74890e1475">It was in the 
                           <title id="d74890e1477">Quarterly Review</title> that my father wrote of Leech's pictures. " While we

                        <p id="d74890e1481">Do we laugh enough? Our fathers laughed better than we do. Is it that we have overeaten
                           of the fruit
                           of the tree pf knowledge? I cannot say. The art of design, as practised by the successors
                           of John
                           Leech who have followed in his steps, still holds its own delightful sway; but the
                           kindred arts of
                           action, of oratory, of literature, have, to some narrow-minded critics, taken most
                           unpleasant forms
                           of sincerity. Sometimes I wonder how the moralist would write of us now, were he still
                           among us. I
                           don't know how the present will strike the new generation, when it has grown up <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="100"> </a></span> to look back in turn upon this somewhat complicated phase of
                           civilization. Sheep's clothing is out of date, and wolf-skins all the fashion now;
                           but they are
                           imitation wolf-skins. The would-be Lion affects the Donkey's ears; the Pharisee is
                           anxious to be
                           seen in the Publican's society for the good impression it makes upon his constituency.
                           It is all
                           very perplexing, and not very edifying to speculate on. And then I feel that any day,
                           while one is
                           fumbling and probing and dissecting and splitting hairs, some genius such as John
                           Leech silently
                           appears and touches commonplace things, and lo! here is a new light upon earth, a
                           new happiness;
                           here is another smile in the land. "Can we have too much of truth and fun and beauty
                           and kindness?"
                           said John Leech's Friend.

                           at the age of
                           thirteen or thereabouts, when my father took me and my little sister for the grand
                           tour of Europe.
                           We had, of course, lived in Paris, and spent our summers in quiet sunny country places
                           abroad with
                           our grandparents, but this was to be something different from anything we had ever
                           known before at
                           St. Germains or Montmorenci among the donkeys. Switzerland and Venice and Vienna,
                           Ger- many and the
                           Rhine! Our young souls thrilled with expectation. And yet those early feasts of life
                           are not unlike
                           the miracle of the loaves and fishes: the twelve basketfuls that remain in after-
                           years are
                           certainly even more precious than the feast itself.

                        <p id="d74890e1506">We started one sleety summer morning. My father was pleased to be off and we were
                           enchanted. He had
                           bought a gray wide-awake hat for the journey, and he had a new sketch-book in his
                           pocket, besides
                           two smaller ones for us, which he produced as the steamer was starting. We sailed
                           from London <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="110" data-tei-n="104"> </a></span> Bridge, and the decks were all wet and slippery as we came on
                           board. We were scatter-brained little girls, although we looked demure enough in our
                           mushroom hats
                           and waterproofs. We had also prepared a travelling trousseau, which consisted of miscellaneous
                           articles belonging to the fancy-goods department of things in general, rather than
                           to the usual
                           outfit of an English gentleman's family. I was not without some diffidence about my
                           luggage. I
                           remember a draught-board, a large wooden work- box, a good many books, paint-boxes,
                           and other odds
                           and ends; but I felt that whatever else might be deficient, our 
                           <hi id="d74890e1510" style="font-style: italic;">new bonnets</hi> would
                           bring us triumphantly out of every crisis. They were alike, but with a difference
                           of blue and pink
                           wreaths of acacia, and brilliant in ribbons to match, at a time when people affected
                           less dazzling
                           colors than they do now. Of course, these treasures were not for the Channel and its
                           mischances;
                           they were carefully packed away and guarded by the draught-boards and work-boxes and
                           the other
                           contents of our trunk; and I may as well conclude the episode at once, for it is not
                           quite without
                           bearing upon what I am trying to recall. Alas for human expectations! When the happy
                           moment came at
                           last, and we had reached foreign parts, and issued out of the hotel dressed and wreathed
                           and
                           triumphantly splendid, my father said: "My dear children, go <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="111" data-tei-n="105"> </a></span> back
                           and put those bonnets away in your box, and don't ever wear them any more! Why, you
                           would be mobbed
                           in these places if you walked out alone with such ribbons!" How the sun shone as he
                           spoke! how my
                           heart sank under the acacia-trees! My sister was eleven years old, and didn't care
                           a bit; but at
                           thirteen and fourteen one's clothes begin to strike root. I felt disgraced, beheaded
                           of my lovely
                           bonnet, utterly crushed, and I turned away to hide my tears.

                        <p id="d74890e1516">Now, there is a passage in the life of Charles Kingsley which, as I believe, concerned
                           this very time
                           and journey; and I am amused, as I remember the tragedy of my bonnet, to think of
                           the different
                           sacrifices which men and women have to pay to popular prejudice, casting their head-gear
                           into the
                           flames just as the people did in the times of Romola. We had started by the packet-boat
                           from London
                           Bridge, as I have said, and immediately we came on board we had been kindly greeted
                           by a family

                           sitting with an
                           umbrella in the drizzle of rain and falling smuts from the funnel. This was the Kingsley
                           family,
                           consisting of the rector of Chelsea and his wife and his two sons (Charles Kingsley
                           was the elder of
                           the two), then going abroad for his health. It will now be seen that my recollections

                           Mr.
                           Kingsley and his brother were wearing brown felt hats with very high and pointed crowns,
                           and with
                           very broad brims, of a different shape from my father's commonplace felt. The hats
                           worn by Mr.
                           Kingsley and his brother were more like those well-known brims and peaks which have
                           crowned so many
                           poets' heads since then.

                        <p id="d74890e1521">It was a stormy crossing; the waves were curling unpleasantly round about the boat.
                           I sat by Mrs.
                           Kingsley, miserable, uncomfortable, and watching in a dazed and hypnotized sort of
                           way the rim of
                           Charles Kingsley's wide-awake as it rose and fell against the horrible horizon. He
                           stood before us,
                           holding on to some ropes, and the horizon rose and fell, and the steamer pitched and
                           tossed, and it
                           seemed as if Time stood still. But we reached those farther shores at last, and parted
                           from our
                           companions, and very soon afterwards my father told us with some amusement of the
                           adventure which
                           befell Mr. Charles Kingsley and his brother almost as soon as they landed, and after
                           they had parted
                           from their parents. They were arrested by the police, who did not like the shape of
                           their wide-
                           awakes. I may as well give the story in Mr. Kingsley's own words, which I found in
                           his

                           after the event to Mrs. Charles Kingsley at home. He says:

                           of the years as

                           themselves are told in turn by the clouds and lights, and by every waving tree and

                        <p id="d74890e1543">In common with most children, the stories of our father's youth always delighted and
                           fascinated us,
                           and we had often heard him speak of his own early days at college and in Germany,
                           and of his happy
                           stay at Pumpernickel-Weimar, where he went to court and saw the great Goethe, and
                           was in love with
                           the beautiful Amalia von X. And now coming to Weimar we found ourselves actually 
                           <hi id="d74890e1545" style="font-style: italic;">alive</hi> in his past somehow, almost living it alongside with him, just like Gogo in Mr. Du
                           Maurier's story. I suddenly find myself walking up the centre of an empty shady street,
                           and my
                           father is pointing to a row of shutters on the first floor of a large and comfortable-looking
                           house.
                           "That is where Frau von X. used to live," he said. "How kind she was to us, and what
                           a pretty girl
                           Amalia was!" And then, a little farther on, we passed the house in the sunshine of
                           a 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1548" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="gr">plaz</foreign> in which he told us he himself had lodged with a friend;
                           and then we came to the palace, with the soldiers and sentries looking like toys wound
                           up from the
                           Burlington Arcade, and going backward and forward with their spikes in front of their
                           own striped
                           boxes; and we saw the acacia-trees with their cropped heads, and the iron gates; and
                           we went across
                           the court-yard into the palace and were <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="115" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span> shown the ball-room and
                           the smaller saloons, and we stood on the shining floors and beheld the classic spot
                           where for the
                           first and only time in all his life, I believe, my father had invited the lovely Amalia
                           to waltz.
                           And then, coming away all absorbed and delighted with our experiences in living backward,
                           my father
                           suddenly said, "I wonder if old Weissenborne is still alive? He used to teach me German."
                           And lo! as
                           he spoke, a tall, thin old man, in a broad-brimmed straw hat, with a beautiful Pomeranian
                           poodle
                           running before him, came stalking along with a newspaper under his arm. "Good gracious,
                           that looks
                           likeâ€”yes, that 
                           <hi id="d74890e1553" style="font-style: italic;">is</hi> Dr. Weissenborne. He is hardly changed a bit," said my father,
                           stopping short for a moment, and then he, too, stepped forward quickly with an outstretched
                           hand,
                           and the old man in turn stopped, stared, frowned. "I am Thackeray, my name is Thackeray,"
                           said my
                           father, eagerly and shyly as was his way; and after another stare from the doctor,
                           suddenly came a
                           friendly lighting up and exclaiming and welcoming and hand-shaking and laughing, while
                           the pretty
                           white dog leaped up and down, as much interested as we were in the meeting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1557">"You have grown so gray I did not know you at first," said the doctor in English.
                           And my father
                           laughed and said he was a great deal grayer now than the doctor himself; then he introduced
                           us to
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="116" data-tei-n="110"> </a></span> the old man, who shook us gravely by the finger-tips with a
                           certain austere friendliness, and once more he turned again with a happy, kind, grim
                           face to my
                           father. Yes, he had followed his career with interest; he had heard of him from this
                           man and that
                           man; he had read one of his books-=not all. Why had he never sent any, why had he
                           never come back
                           before? "You must bring your misses and all come and breakfast at my lodging," said
                           Dr.
                           Weissenborne.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1563">"And is this your old dog?" my father asked, after accepting the doctor's invitation.
                           Dr.
                           Weissenborne shook his head. Alas! the old dog was no more; he died two years before.
                           Meanwhile the
                           young dog was very much there, frisking and careering in cheerful circles round about
                           us. The doctor
                           and his dog had just been starting for their daily walk in the woods when they met
                           us, and they now
                           invited us to accompany them. We called at the lodging by the way to announce our
                           return to
                           breakfast, and then started off together for the park. The park (I am writing of years
                           and years
                           ago) was a bright, green little wood, with leaves and twigs and cheerful lights, with
                           small trees
                           not very thickly planted on the steep slopes, with many narrow paths wandering into
                           green depths,
                           and with seats erected at intervals along the way. On one of these seats the old professor
                           showed us
                           an <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="117" data-tei-n="111"> </a></span> inscription cut deep into the wood with a knife, "
                           <hi id="d74890e1567" style="font-style: italic;">Doctor W. and his dog.</hi>" Who had carved it? He did not know. But besides this inscription,
                           on every one of the benches where Goethe used to rest, and on every tree which used
                           to shade his
                           head, was written another inscription, invisible indeed, and yet which we seemed to
                           read all along
                           the way â€”"Here Goethe's life was spent; here he walked, here he rested; his feet have
                           passed to and
                           fro along this narrow pathway. It leads to his garden- house."

                        <p id="d74890e1571">It was lovely summer weather, as I have said, that weather which used to be so common
                           when one was
                           young, and which I dare say our children still discover now, though we cannot always
                           enjoy it. We
                           came back with our friend the doctor, and break- fasted with him in his small apartment,
                           in a room
                           full of books, at a tiny table drawn to an open window; then after breakfast we sat
                           in the
                           professor's garden among the nasturtiums. My sister and I were given books to read;
                           they were
                           translations for the use of students, I remember; and the old friends smoked together
                           and talked
                           over a hundred things. Amalia was married and had several children; she was away.
                           Madame von Goethe
                           was still in Weimar with her sons, and Fraulein von Pogwishe, her sister, was also
                           there. "They
                           would be delighted to see you again," said the professor. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="118" data-tei-n="112"> </a></span> "We
                           will go together, and leave the young misses here till our return." But not so; our
                           father declared
                           we also must be allowed to come. My recollections (according to the wont of such provoking
                           things)
                           here begin to fail me, and in the one particular which is of any interest; for though
                           we visited
                           Goethe's old house, I can scarcely remember it at all, only that the doctor said Madame
                           von Goethe
                           had moved after Goethe's death. She lived in a handsome house in the town, with a
                           fine staircase
                           running up between straight walls, and leading into a sort of open hall, where, amid
                           a good deal of
                           marble and stateliness, stood two little unpretending ladies by a big round table
                           piled with many
                           books and papers. The ladies were Madame von Goethe and her sister. Dr. Weissenborne
                           went first and
                           announced an old friend, and then ensued more welcomings and friendly exclamations
                           and quick
                           recognitions on both sides, benevolently su- perintended by our Virgil. "And are you
                           both as fond of
                           reading novels as ever?" my father asked. The ladies laughed; they said "Yes, indeed,"
                           and pointed
                           to a boxful of books which had just arrived, with several English novels among them,
                           which they had
                           been unpacking as we came in. Then the sons of the house were sent forâ€”kind and friendly
                           and
                           unassuming young men, walking in, and as much interested and pleased to witness their
                           parent's <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="119" data-tei-n="113"> </a></span> pleasure as we were; not handsome, with nothing of their
                           grandfather's noble aspect (as one sees it depicted), but with most charming and courteous
                           ways. One
                           was a painter, the mother told us, the other a musician. And while my father talked
                           to the elder
                           ladies, the young men took us younger ones in hand. They offered to show us the celebrated
                           garden-house, and asked us to drink tea there next day. And so it happened that once
                           more we found
                           ourselves being conducted through the little shady wood. But to be walking there with
                           Goethe's
                           family, with his grandsons and their mother, the Ottilie who had held the dying poet's
                           hand to the
                           last; to be going to his favorite resort where so much of his time was spent; to hear
                           him so
                           familiarly quoted and spoken of, was something like hearing a distant echo of the
                           great voice
                           itself; something like seeing the skirts of his dressing-gown just waving before us.
                           And at the age
                           I was then impressions are so vivid that I have always all my life had a vague feeling
                           of having
                           been in Goethe's presence. We seemed to find something of it every- where, most of
                           all in the little
                           garden-house, in the bare and simple room where he used to write. One of the kind
                           young men went to
                           the window and showed us something on the pane. What it was I know not clearly, but
                           I think it was
                           his name written with a diamond; and finally, in the garden, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="120" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span> at a
                           wooden table, among trees and dancing shadows, we drank our tea, and I remember Wolfgang
                           von Goethe
                           handing a teacup, and the look of it, and suddenly the whole thing vanishes. . . .
                           There was a
                           certain simple dignity and hospitality in it all which seems to belong to all the
                           traditions of
                           hospitable Weimar, and my father's pleasure and happy emotion gave a value and importance
                           to every
                           tiny detail of that short but happy time. Even the people at the inn remembered him,
                           and came out to
                           greet him; but they sent in such an enormous bill as we were departing on the evening
                           of the second
                           day that he exclaimed in dismay to the waiter, "So much for sentimental recollections!
                           Tell the host
                           I shall never be able to afford to come back to Weimar again."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1580">The waiter stared; I wonder if he delivered the message. 'The hotel-bill I have just
                           mentioned was a
                           real disappointment to my father, and, alas for disillusions! another more serious
                           shock, a meeting
                           which was no meeting, somewhat dashed the remembrance of Amalia von X.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1583">It happened at Venice, a year or two after our visit to Weimar. We were breakfasting
                           at a long table
                           where a fat lady also sat a little way off, with a pale fat little boy beside her.
                           She was stout;
                           she was dressed in light green; she was silent; she was eating an egg. The 
                           <hi id="d74890e1585" style="font-style: italic;">sala</hi> of
                           the great marble hotel <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="115"> </a></span> was shaded from the blaze of sunshine, but
                           stray gleams shot across the dim hall, falling on the palms and the orange-trees beyond
                           the lady,
                           who gravely shifted her place as the sunlight dazzled her. Our own meal was also spread,
                           and my
                           sister and I were only waiting for my father to begin. He came in presently, saying
                           he had been
                           looking at the guest-book in the outer hall, and he had seen a name which had interested
                           him very
                           much. "Frau von Z. Geboren von X. It must be Amalia! She must be 
                           <hi id="d74890e1590" style="font-style: italic;">here</hi>â€”in the
                           hotel," he said; and as he spoke he asked a waiter whether Madame von Z. was still
                           in the hotel. "I
                           believe that is Madame von Z.," said the waiter, pointing to the fat lady. The lady
                           looked up and
                           then went on with her egg, and my poor father turned away, saying in a low, overwhelmed
                           voice, "
                           That Amalia! That cannot be Amalia." I could not understand his silence, his discomposure.
                           "Aren't
                           you going to speak to her? Oh, please do go and speak to her!" we both cried. "Do
                           make sure if it is
                           Amalia." But he shook his head. " I can't," he said; " I had rather not." Amalia meanwhile,
                           having
                           finished her egg, rose deliberately, put down her napkin and walked away, followed
                           by her little
                           boy.

                           at once. Once more
                           I heard of Amalia long years afterwards, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="116"> </a></span> when by a happy
                           hospitable chance I met Dr. Norman MacLeod at the house of my old friends, Mr. and
                           Mrs. Cunliffe. I
                           was looking at him, and thinking that in some indefinable way he put me in mind of
                           the past, when he
                           suddenly asked me if I knew that he and my father had been together as boys at Weimar,
                           learning
                           German from the same professor, and both in love with the same beautiful girl. "What,
                           Amalia? Dr.
                           Weissenborne?" I cried. "Dear me! do you know about Amalia ?" said Dr. MacLeod, "and
                           do you know
                           about old Weissenborne? I thought I was the only person left to remember them. We
                           all learned from
                           Weissenborne, we were all in love with Amalia, every one of us, your father too! What
                           happy days
                           those were!" And then he went on to tell us that years and years afterwards, when
                           they met again on
                           the occasion of one of the lecturing tours in Scotland, he, Dr. MacLeod, and the rest
                           of the
                           notabilities were all assembled to receive the lecturer on the platform, and as my
                           father came by
                           carrying his papers and advancing to take his place at the reading-desk, he recognized
                           Dr. MacLeod
                           as he passed, and in the face of all the audience he bent forward and said, gravely,
                           without
                           stopping one moment on his way, 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1598" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="gr">Ich liebe Amalia doch</foreign>,"
                           and so went on to deliver his lecture.

                           too, had come a disillusion. He, too, had been overwhelmed and shocked by the change
                           of years. Poor
                           lady! I can't help being very sorry for her; to have had two such friends and not
                           to have kept them
                           seems a cruel fate. To have been so charming, that her present seemed but a calumny
                           upon the past.
                           It is like the story of the woman who flew into a fury with her own portrait, young,
                           smiling, and
                           triumphant, and who destroyed it, so as not to be taunted by the past any more. Let
                           us hope that
                           Frau von Z. was never conscious of her loss, never looked upon this picture and on
                           that.

                        <p id="d74890e1608">Since writing all this, I have found an old letter from my father to his mother, and
                           written from
                           Weimar. It is dated 29th September, 1830. "There is a capital library here," he says,
                           "which is open
                           to me, an excellent theatre which costs a shilling a night, and a charming 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1610" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">petite sociÃ©tÃ©</foreign> which costs nothing. Goethe, the great lion of Weimar, I have
                           not yet seen, but his daughter-in-law has promised to introduce me." Then he describes
                           going to
                           court: "I have had to air my legs in black breeches and to sport a black coat, black
                           waistcoat, and
                           cock-hat, looking something like a cross between a footman and a Methodist parson.

                           of Seville' and the 'Flauto Magico.' Hiimmel conducts the orchestra [then comes a
                           sketch of Hiimmel
                           with huge shirt-collar]. The orchestra is excellent, but the singers are not first-rate."
                           ... Amalia
                           must have had rivals, even in those early days, for this same letter goes on to say:
                           " I have fallen
                           in love with the Princess of Weimar, who is unluckily married to Prince Charles of
                           Prussia. I must
                           get over this unfortunate passion, which will otherwise, I fear, bring me to an untimely
                           end. There

                        <p id="d74890e1648">ONE day Jackson drove the blue fly up to the door, and my father, looking rather smart,
                           with a packet
                           of papers in his hand, and my grandmother, who had come over from Paris, and my sister
                           and I all got
                           in, and we drove away, a nervous company, to Willis's Rooms to hear the first of the
                           lectures upon
                           the English Humorists. My father was of course very nervous, but as we drove along
                           he made little
                           jokes to reassure us all; then together we mounted the carpeted staircase leading
                           to the long, empty
                           room, and after a time he left us. I have no very pleasant recollection of that particular
                           half-hour
                           of my life. I remember the unoccupied chairs, and people coming in rather subdued,
                           as if into a
                           church. Many of the windows were open, the sky looked very blue over the roof-tops,
                           our hearts were
                           thumping, the carriages outside came driving up with distant rumbling sounds growing
                           louder and
                           louder; and I remember wondering at the time whether I should mind very much if the
                           day of judgment
                           could suddenly come upon us and thus put an end to this terrible <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="128" data-tei-n="122"> </a></span>
                           ordeal, which desperate imagination was a real consolation to me at the moment. It
                           is a happiness to
                           realize now who it was who came to my dear father's help when all our emotion and
                           sympathy was, I
                           fear, only a hinderance. I cannot help giving the passage out of Mrs. Kemble's records
                           concerning
                           my father's lectures, although it may have already been quoted by others.

                                    <p id="d74890e1658">"I met Thackeray at Miss Perry's at dinner, a few days before he began his course
                                       of lectures on
                                       the English Humorists, and he asked me to come and hear him, and told me he was so
                                       nervous about
                                       it that he was afraid he should break down....

                                    <p id="d74890e1661">"He was to lecture at Willis's Rooms, in the same room where I read; and going thither
                                       before the
                                       time for his beginning I found him standing like a forlorn, disconsolate giant in
                                       the middle of
                                       the room, gazing about him. 'O Lord!' he exclaimed, as he shook hands with me,'I'm
                                       sick at my
                                       stomach with fright!' I spoke some words of encouragement to him and was going away,
                                       but he held
                                       my hand like a scared child, crying, 'Oh, don't leave me!' 'But,' said I, 'Thackeray,
                                       you
                                       mustn't stand here. Your audience are beginning to come in'; and I drew him from the
                                       middle of
                                       the chairs and benches, which were beginning to be occupied, into the retiring-room
                                       adjoining
                                       the lecture-room, my own reading having made me perfectly familiar with both. 'Oh,'
                                       he said, 'if
                                       I could only get at that confounded thing [his lecture], to have a last look at it!'
                                       'Where is
                                       it?' said I. 'Oh, in the next room on the reading-desk.' 'Well,' said I, 'if you don't
                                       like to

                                       and get it, I'll fetch it for you.' And remembering
                                       well the position of my reading-table, which had been close to the door of the retiring-room,
                                       I
                                       darted in, hoping to snatch the manuscript without attracting the attention of the
                                       audience,
                                       with which the room was already nearly full. I had been used to deliver my readings
                                       seated at a
                                       very low table, but my friend Thackeray gave his lectures standing, and had had a
                                       reading-desk
                                       placed on the platform, adapted to his own very tall stature, so that when I came
                                       to get his
                                       manuscript it was almost above my head. Though rather disconcerted, I was determined
                                       not to go
                                       back with- out it, and so made a half-jump and a clutch at the book, when every leaf
                                       of it (they
                                       were not fastened together) came fluttering separately down about me. I hardly know
                                       what I did,
                                       but I think I must have gone nearly on all-fours in my agony to gather up the scattered
                                       leaves,
                                       and retreating with them, held them out in dismay to poor Thackeray, crying, 'Oh,
                                       look, look
                                       what a dreadful thing I have done!' 'My dear soul,' said he, 'you couldn't have done
                                       better for
                                       me. I have just a quarter of an hour to wait here, and it will take me about that
                                       to page this
                                       again, and it's the best thing in the world that could have happened.'"

                        <p id="d74890e1673">And so while my father was paging the manuscript, and we were waiting outside, the
                           people kept coming
                           in more and more quickly and filling up the places in front of us, behind us, all
                           round us, settling
                           down, unfastening their wraps, nodding to each other. I was gazing at a lady who had
                           taken off her
                           bonnet and sat in a little Quaker cap just in front of me, when suddenly, there stood
                           my <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="130" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span> father facing this great roomful. Though we had been waiting all the
                           time, he came sooner than we expected. His voice sounded strained and odd for an instant,
                           and I
                           didn't recognize it. <q style=" display: inline; ">"In treating of the English humorists of the eighteenth century, it is of
                              the men rather than of their works,"</q> so the strange voice began, and then almost immediately
                           it softened and deepened and became his own, and at the same time as he stood there
                           I realized that
                           he looked just like himself: there was his waist- coat and his watch-chain, and my
                           vague youthful
                           spinnings and chokings and confusions began to subside.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1681">I was now glad the day of judgment hadn't come. I don't remember taking in one word
                           after the first
                           sentence, but sat staring and taking breath, and realizing somehow that all was going
                           well. Among
                           other things I did notice, and do remember, the proud and happy look of light and
                           relief in my
                           grandmother's face, and her beautiful gray eyes all shining, when the people applauded,
                           and the
                           lecture was all over just as unexpectedly as it had begun, and the lady in the Quaker
                           cap tied her
                           bonnet on again, and somebody said she was the Duchess of Sutherland, and the people
                           were all
                           talking and crowding up and shaking hands with the lecturer. Then came the happy drive
                           home; Jackson
                           made the horse gallop, and my father <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="125"> </a></span> laughed and made real jokes
                           without any effort, and we laughed and enjoyed every jolt and turning on the way home
                           this time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1686">These lectures gradually became a part of our every-day life, just as much as the
                           books and the
                           articles my father used to write, and the little printers' boys waiting and swinging
                           their legs in
                           the hall. Young men's institutes and provincial agencies used to invite him to the
                           north and to the
                           south. He came and he went; sometimes he read in the suburbs or at friends' houses,
                           at Mrs.
                           Procter's and elsewhere; once he read at home, at the request, I think, of his well-loved
                           Mrs.
                           Elliot and Miss Perry. Sometimes he took us with him when he was not going very far
                           from home. To
                           this day I can enjoy that glorious summer's day we first spent at Oxford among the
                           gardens and the
                           gables, and where, with our host St. John Thackeray, we stood in the street outside
                           watching the
                           backs of the audience pressing in to hear the lecture.

                        <p id="d74890e1690">One year my father told us that he was going awayâ€”he was going to America to give
                           his lectures there;
                           he was going as soon as he had finished the book upon which he was engaged, and we

                           stand on end, my fingers used to turn to stone when I tried to play to him; even the
                           things I liked
                           best seemed to go off the rails in some general catastrophe.

                           That whole
                           summer of 1854 seemed darkened by the coming separation. It was a long and burning
                           Summer; even the
                           shadows seemed burned up, and so were,the gardens at the back of the houses, and the
                           brown turf and
                           the avenues of Kensington Gardens, those gardens where that strange mist which is
                           not quite fog nor
                           quite real nor even a fancy, but which has always seemed to me to be the very spirit
                           of London
                           itself, comes rising along the straight and formal distances. My father was hard at'
                           work finishing
                           a book which some people still say is the best of all his books. People read it then,
                           when it came
                           out, and read it still and re- <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="133" data-tei-n="127"> </a></span> read it. He used to write in his
                           study with the vine shading the two windows, and we used to do our lessons, or sit
                           sewing and
                           reading in the front room with the bow-window to the street; and one day, as we were
                           there with our
                           governess, my father came in in great excitement. <q style=" display: inline; ">"There's a young fellow just come,"</q> said
                           he; <q style=" display: inline; ">"he has brought a thousand pounds in his pocket; he has made me an offer for my book;

                              more
                              than a boy; his name is George Smith; he is waiting there now, and I must go back;"</q> and
                           then, after walking once up and down the room, my father went away, and for the first
                           time, a
                           lifetime ago, I heard the name of this good friend-to-be.

                        <p id="d74890e1712">A great many arrangements were made for the coming year's absence; there was a talk
                           of letting the
                           house, but it was only shut up with a couple of old servants to keep. it. My father's
                           servants
                           rarely left him. His old publishers gave him a silver punch-bowl, and his new publisher
                           (I am
                           writing of nearly half a century ago) gave him a beautiful despatch-box; and this
                           same good friend
                           gave Sto my sister and to me a noble drawing of our father's head, by Samuel Lawrence,
                           to look at
                           while he was away. Then we all set off and went abroad to rejoin our grandmother and
                           grandfather,
                           and for <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="134" data-tei-n="128"> </a></span> a little while we travelled together, and then my father
                           had to leave us. I can see him now as he stood beside a wooden column at some railway
                           junctionâ€”Olten, I think it wasâ€”and he stooped to kiss us; and then he put us into
                           our railway
                           carriage, and we were carried off with heavy hearts while he stood looking at us fixedly,
                           tall and
                           straight, and the train scudded off. Somehow we never got used to these partings,
                           though our father
                           returned each time safe and in good spirits, and pleased with his journey and its
                           results.

                        <p id="d74890e1717">People can still walk through Kensington Square and look up at the house, yet standing
                           with its
                           windows facing westward, in which Rachel Castlewood once dwelt, and where Colonel
                           Esmond came, and
                           where the Pretender also came in his blond periwig and blue ribbon, and threw awayâ€”so
                           Colonel Esmond
                           tells usâ€”a kingdom for a passing fancy. In so looking they may well people the past
                           with figures all
                           touched with its color, and yet so strangely living still that as one reads one seems
                           to have known
                           them all. But any one who may try to follow the familiar shades out of the precincts
                           of Kensington
                           Square and beyond Young Street, where the porters with the chairs must have passed,
                           into the
                           high-road which leads to London; must be imaginative indeed to conjure up their remembrance
                           any
                           more. The King's Arms, where the conspirators <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="135" data-tei-n="129"> </a></span> were assembled when
                           King George was proclaimed, has vanished out of sight; its quiet gardens are piled
                           up high with
                           bricks and stories rearing like a new Babel to the sky. There are cities spreading
                           where the
                           market-gardens were flowering but yesterday, tram-cars passing, engines whistling.
                           I can scarcely
                           imagine my father himself writing 
                           <title id="d74890e1721">Esmond</title> in such a chaos. Novels of the future will
                           take place by telegram, in flats, in lifts, in metropolitan railwaysâ€”they will whirl,
                           Ixion-like, on
                           perpetual bicycles and wheels. It is difficult to imagine devotion such as Esmond's
                           continuing in
                           this present sequence of events; it seems as if new impulses, both physical and mental,
                           must arise
                           in such a multiplicity of impressions; as if a new race must people the earth. Beatrice,
                           indeed,
                           might belong to these latter times; but Esmond and Lady Castlewood would seem strangely

                           Some one has given me a map of Kensington in 1764, by which
                           one can see what lanes and green fields and gardens still lay be-
                           tween the village and London, more than a mile away. Nursery
                           gardens, wide open spaces, brick kilns on Campden Hill, and gravel
                           pits. In the midst of green fields stood three or four houses called
                           "Bays Watering." The Serpentine was called the New River,
                           Kensington Gore consisted of five houses. Hogmore Lane and
                           Lobb's Field ran from the high-road towards Chelsea. Though I
                           have the map before me, I can hardly feel that it was ever true, and
                           yet I remember Hogmore Lane. And there was Love Lane beyond,
                           along which we used to go for straggling walks with our playfellows
                           the.Coles, who lived in the Terrace close by. We used to start about
                           six o'clock on summer mornings, and come home with 'branches of
                           hawthorn flowers to decorate our school-room and to remind our-
                           selves that it was May-time.

                           then, and that is
                           Cheyne Row, which used to be at the end of all these hawthorn lanes, by the onward
                           course of fashion
                           and events; and that is Chelsea, whither we used often to be sent as children, crossing
                           the lanes
                           and fields, and coming by a pond and a narrow street called Paradise Row into the

                           then after a few minutes' walk to Cheyne Row, where Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle lived to
                           the end of their
                           lives, and which seems to all of us made living still by their dead footsteps.

                        <p id="d74890e1738">The old house in Cheyne Row is one of the first things I can remember when we came
                           to London. Its
                           stillness, its dimness, its panelled walls, its carved balusters, and the quiet garden
                           behind, where
                           at intervals in the brickwork lay the tobacco-pipes all ready for use: little Nero,
                           the doggie, in
                           his little coat, barking and trembling in every limbâ€”it all comes before one with
                           so much clearness
                           that, although so much has been said about that home, I cannot omit all mention of
                           a place which
                           made so vivid a part of my early life.

                        <p id="d74890e1741">In the dining-room stood that enchanting screen covered with pictures, drawings, prints,
                           fashions,
                           portraits without end, which my father liked so much; up-stairs was the panelled drawing-room
                           with
                           its windows to the Row, and the portrait of <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="131"> </a></span> Oliver Cromwell
                           hanging opposite the windows. But best of all, there was Mrs. Carlyle herself, a living
                           picture:
                           Gainsborough should have been alive to paint her: slim, bright, upright, in her place.
                           She looked
                           like one of the grand ladies our father used sometimes to take us to call upon. She
                           used to be
                           handsomely dressed in velvet and point lace. She sat there at leisure and prepared
                           for conversation.
                           She was not familiar, but cordial, dignified, interested in everything as she sat
                           installed in her
                           corner of the sofa by one of the little tables covered with knick-knacks of silver
                           and
                           mother-of-pearl.

                        <p id="d74890e1746">Almost the first time we ever went to see her we had walked to Chelsea through the
                           snow, and across
                           those lanes which have now become South Kensington, and when we arrived, numb and
                           chilled and tired,
                           we found in the dining-room below, standing before the fire, two delicious hot cups
                           of chocolate
                           already prepared for us, with saucers placed upon the top.

                           </said> said she, and the hot chocolate became a sort of institution. Again and again
                           she has sat by, benevolent and spirited, superintending our wintry feasts, inviting
                           our confidences,
                           confiding in us to a certain degree.

                        <p id="d74890e1752">She used to tell us many of the stories which have since come into print. She, was
                           never weary of
                           discoursing of "Carlyle," of his genius, his dyspepsia, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="138" data-tei-n="132"> </a></span> of
                           quoting his sayings. 
                           <said id="d74890e1756">"If you wish for a quiet life,"</said> she used to say,

                           beard, how all the time he had saved by ceasing to shave he spent wandering about
                           the house, and
                           bemoaning that which was amiss in the universe. As children we did not have much of
                           Carlyle's
                           company; if he came in and sat down in the arm-chair, which was his on the opposite
                           side to the
                           sofa, we immediately went away; but the sense of his presence overhead in the study
                           distinctly added
                           to our enjoyment so long as he remained up-stairs. Mrs. Carlyle used to tell us of
                           her early life,
                           of her love for study. Many of her admonitions and friendly warnings have remained
                           in my memory.
                           Once, looking expressively at me with her dark eyes, she began to speak of self-control.

                           a diary at the
                           time, in which I find the following record of a brown-paper parcel:â€”"To Mrs. Carlyle's,
                           where we
                           found Lady Stanley of Alderley just leaving the room; then Mrs. Carlyle, taking up
                           the talk again,
                           immediately began speaking enthusiastically about 
                           <title id="d74890e1780">Adam Bede</title>, which had just come out.
                           She had written to the author, she said; she had received grateful messages from her
                           in reply. She
                           said that Mr. Carlyle quite declined reading the book, and when she expressed a hope
                           that it might
                           be sent to her,

                           publisher's
                           brown-paper parcel. Mr. Carlyle, who had followed her in, came and sat down upon the
                           sofa. Mrs.
                           Carlyle exclaimed and started forward. We opened our eyes in delighted partisanship;
                           the string was
                           cut, and there, sure enough, were the three orange volumes of

                              Carlyle who has worked more than any other to give it its independence."</q></p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1900">I went out with my father one evening in the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="142" data-tei-n="136"> </a></span> winter of 1863, and
                           as we were driving along in the dusk by the Serpentine we passed Carlyle walking across
                           the park,
                           and my father, seeing him, leaned forward and waved his hands. <q style=" display: inline; ">"A great, benevolent shower of
                              salutations,"</q> Carlyle called it, when he spoke in after-days of this last meeting.

                        <p id="d74890e1908">After Mrs. Carlyle's death, it was Carlyle that we used to go and see in the old drawing-room,
                           which
                           he took to inhabiting altogether. It was no surprise, when his history was told, to
                           realize that he
                           had been sometimes cross and often contrary; but that passion of tender love and remorse
                           and
                           devotion came as a revelation all the more moving that one had almost guessed it at
                           times. It was
                           when my own father died that something was revealed to us of his deep and tender feeling.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e1911">After Carlyle himself was laid to rest I went for the last time to look at the house
                           which I
                           remembered all my life; my little boy was with me, and he began crowing and pointing
                           to the old
                           screen full of pictures, some of which his grandfather had drawn. It still stood in
                           its place in the
                           dining-room. From behind the old screen came Mrs. Alexander Carlyle, carrying her
                           little Tom, who,
                           seeing a fellow-baby, uttered three deep notes, and in them was some strange echo
                           of the familiar
                           voice that had filled the house so long, and reached how far beyond its walls!

                        <p id="d74890e1917">P.S.â€”It will be remembered in Lewes's 
                           <title id="d74890e1919">Life of Goethe</title> there is an account of a birthday
                           gift sent by fifteen Englishmen to Goethe. <q style=" display: inline; ">"The young Carlyle, who had been cheered through his
                              struggling sadness and strengthened for the part he was to play in life by the beauty
                              and the
                              wisdom which Goethe had revealed to him, conceived the idea that it would be a pleasant
                              and a
                              fitting thing if some of the few admirers of Goethe in England forwarded to Weimar
                              a trifling
                              token of their admiration. On reaching home Mrs. Carlyle at once sketched the design
                              of a seal
                              to be engraved, the Serpent of Eternity encircling a star, with the words. 'Ohne Rast,
                              ohne
                              Hast' (Unhasting, un- resting), in allusion to the well-known verses, <q style=" display: inline; ">"'Like a star
                                 unhasting, unresting be each one fulfilling his God- given hest.'"</q></q> It was the
                           remembrance of this little incident which suggested long years afterwards another
                           small presentation
                           at a time when Carlyle was living in Cheyne Row with his niece. There had been some
                           alarm of
                           house-breakers in Chelsea, which sacrilegious house-breakers, not content with robbing
                           ordinary
                           people, broke into Mr. Carlyle's house and ran away again without carrying off anything
                           more
                           valuable than a dining-room clock. It was, as I say, the remembrance of the little
                           incident of the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="144" data-tei-n="138"> </a></span> seal which suggested to some one the idea of replacing the
                           stolen clock, and about fifteen of Carlyle's friends and admirers subscribed to purchase
                           one, a
                           small sign of their respect and good-will. Among the subscribers were his old friends
                           Lady Stanley
                           of Alderley, Lady Airlie, Mrs. Oliphant, and Mr. Lecky. Lady Stanley was asked to
                           be spokeswoman on
                           the occasion, and to present the little gift. It was Carlyle's birthday, and a dismal
                           winter's
                           day;<a href="#note_004" class="ref-note" rend="super">*</a> the streets were shrouded in greenish vapors, and the houses looked no less
                           dreary with- in than the streets through which we had come. Somewhat chilled and depressed,
                           we all
                           assembled in Lady Stanley's great drawing-room in Dover Street, where the fog had
                           also penetrated,
                           and presently from the farther end of the room, advancing through the darkness, came
                           Carlyle. There
                           was a moment's pause. No one moved. He stood in the middle of the room without speaking.
                           No doubt
                           the philosopher as well as his disciples felt the influence of the atmosphere. Lady
                           Stanley went to
                           meet him. <q style=" display: inline; ">"Here is a little birthday present we want you to accept from us all, Mr. Carlyle,"</q>
                           said she, quickly pushing up before him a small table upon which stood the clock ticking
                           all ready
                           for his acceptance. Then came another silence, broken by a knell, sadly sounding in
                           our ears.

                           melancholy moment. Nobody could speak. The unfortunate promoter of the scheme felt
                           her heart sinking
                           into her shoes. Had she but had the wit to answer him cheerfully, to assure him that
                           any- how Time
                           had a great deal to do with him, the little ceremony might have been less of a fiasco
                           than it
                           assuredly was; and yet I think afterwards the old man must have been pleased, and
                           liked to think he
                           was remembered. Few people could value sincerity as he did, or better know the worth
                           of love and
                           affectionate respect.

                        <p id="d74890e1964"> HAVE already mentioned my father's tour in America when he went to deliver those
                           lectures which had
                           been so successful in England. Saying good-bye is the price one has to pay even for
                           a prosperous and
                           fortunate expedition. I can still see him as he stood on the platform of the railway
                           station at
                           Olten, in Belgium, where we parted. He stood by a slender iron column, looking very
                           tall and very
                           sad as he watched the train go off in which we were bound for Switzerland with our
                           grandparents. He
                           himself was returning to England through Germany. He had to correct the proofs of
                           
                           <title id="d74890e1966">Esmond</title> before he left, and to give some more lectures in the provinces, and to

                        <p id="d74890e1971">My grandmother was very miserable and nervous. She had brought him a life-belt for
                           his cabin as a
                           farewell gift, and thoroughly frightened herself by so doing. We were too young to
                           be nervous, but
                           we were very unhappy. Our dear old grandfather did his best to cheer us all, and after
                           we had parted
                           from my father he made out all sorts of pleasant <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="150" data-tei-n="144"> </a></span> little plans,
                           and ordered various special

                           hotels suited to our youthful appetites. He took us for walks and to visit museums,
                           and he always
                           consulted any fellow-travellers and sight-seers as to our next movements. Indeed,
                           our journeyings
                           greatly depended upon these chance encounters and recommendations. The first night,
                           when we put up
                           at some little inn, the waiter brought us the traveller's book to write our names
                           in; I forget all
                           about the place, but I can see the book and the table-spread, and what I do most vividly
                           remember is
                           our despair when, instead of the neat 
                           <hi id="d74890e1978" style="font-style: italic;">Mr. Thackeray and family</hi>, to which we were
                           used, we read the following announcement in our grandfather's handwriting:

                           My grandmother, sad as she was, began to laugh, and we all entreated our dear old
                           major to make some
                           changes in the inscription, but he stuck to it, and would not alter a single letter.

                           is so beautiful;
                           and the Tyrol is delightful too, but not like our Switzerland. And one Swiss cottage
                           is uncommonly

                           any bread, all except a little bit which she gave out of her mouth to her mamma. And

                           terror and emotion.
                           We were in a tall hotel, with windows looking towards the lake, and it was lovely
                           summer weather,
                           but it was a dismal time. My dear grandmother sought for sympathy among the people
                           to whom she was
                           naturally drawn, the masters and teachers belonging to the Protestant Church in Geneva.
                           They were
                           interesting and important personages, who inspired me with a curious mixture of respect
                           and
                           discomfort, and to whom my grandmother had brought various introductions from her
                           friends the French
                           Protestant 
                           <foreign id="d74890e1995" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">pasteurs</foreign> at Paris.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="152" data-tei-n="146"> </a></span>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2001">There was a garden to which she took me, not far from our hotel, with beautiful shady
                           trees and
                           spreading grass. In the garden stood a white chapelâ€”clean, light, bare, decorous,
                           with some black
                           and white marble ornamentations. A woman in a black frilled cap showed us to our seats,
                           and there we
                           waited, listening for some time to a clanging bell. Then the service began. Only one
                           or two people
                           came to it, but the place, although to others it might speak of most fervent and passionate
                           emotion,
                           seemed oppressive with chill and silent religion to me. When all was over, my grandmother
                           had some
                           low-voiced conversation with the woman in the black cap, who beckoned to the bell-ringer,
                           and the
                           result of the whispering was that, after a short delay, we were led across the grass
                           and under the
                           trees to a retired part of the garden, where in the shade of some bushes sat an old
                           man of very
                           noble aspect, with long white hair falling on his shoulders. He looked to me like
                           some superior
                           being. Indeed, to my excited imagination it seemed as if I were being brought up to
                           the feet of a
                           prophet, to some inspired person who was sitting there in authority and in judgment
                           on all the rest
                           of the world. This old man was M. CÃ©sar Malan, the head of a section of the Calvinist
                           Church in
                           Geneva, whose name was well known and very widely respected. He had built the chapel
                           in his garden.
                           Not a little to my <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="153" data-tei-n="147"> </a></span> consternation, after a few words with my
                           grandmother, he immediately, with the utmost kindness, began asking me questions about
                           myself, about
                           my coivictions, my religious impressions, my hopes, my future aspirations. He was
                           very kind, but
                           even an angel from heaven would be alarming, suddenly appearing to a girl of fifteen
                           with such a
                           catechism. The more kindly he pressed me, the less able I was to answer. Sometimes
                           I said too much,
                           sometimes I was hopelessly silent, and in the midst of a nervous discussion as to
                           the ultimate fate
                           of Judas (I felt somewhat akin to him myself) the scene ended in my bursting into
                           tears of
                           embarrassment and hopeless confusion. I was consoled on our return to the hotel by
                           my grandfather,
                           who was most sympathetic. 
                           <said id="d74890e2005">"Those, my dear child," he said, "who have studied deeply, who are
                              able to read the Scriptures in the original, are far more likely than you or I to
                              be able to
                              judge correctly upon such important subjects, and we had therefore better leave all
                              such
                              speculations entirely to them."

                        <p id="d74890e2008">That next winter, which we spent in Paris, we used to attend the classes of a man
                           even better known
                           than CÃ©sar Malanâ€”Adolphe Monod, who remains to me one of the most striking and noble
                           figures I have
                           ever met; his face, his dark eyes, all spoke as well as his eloquent voice, and, above
                           all, his
                           earnest life and ways. To me he seemed the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="154" data-tei-n="148"> </a></span> St. Paul of my own
                           time; and those classes which cost so many tears, and which gave rise to so much agitated
                           discussion, are still among the most touching and heart-reaching experiences of my
                           life. I can see
                           the girls' faces now, as they listened to their beloved pasteur. Our hearts were in
                           our lessons, as
                           his was in his teaching, undoubtedly; we were allin earnest and ready to follow; only,
                           though I
                           longed to be convinced, I could only admire and love the lesson and the teacher as
                           well. He warned,
                           encouraged, explained in his earnest, gentle voice. 
                           <said id="d74890e2012">"Ah,

                           hearts were open to receive, not to reject, it was then. M. Monod himself was no unimportant
                           factor
                           in my world. I once saw Faraday, who reminded me of him. The 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2021" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">pasteur</foreign> had come to see my grandmother on this occasion, and I met him on the
                           staircase; but he passed me by, and did not recognize me out of my place in the second
                           row of
                           chairs, nor did I venture to speak to him. I still remember the strange thrill we
                           felt, and which
                           ran in a whisper along the class, when we heard that Henrietta P. had been refused
                           her first
                           communion for going to a ball within a week of the event. She came no <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="155" data-tei-n="149"> </a></span> more to the meetings. The girls sat in their places on rows of straw
                           chairs, and many of the parents accompanied them. Sometimes in a corner by the window
                           holding up a
                           small Bible, in which he followed the references with attention, there sat an oldish
                           gentleman, who
                           was (so we were told) the great prime-minister, M. Guizot.

                        <p id="d74890e2028">My father did not sail for America till the autumn of that year, but we remained on
                           at Paris with our
                           grandparents. The sun streamed into our apartments all day long, for we had windows
                           looking to every
                           side of the compass. When Paris was getting intolerably hot, we started for the country,
                           where my
                           grandfather had taken a country-house on a lease for two or three years, in a village
                           called
                           Mennecy, near Corbeil. Mennecy was a straggling little village among peat fields,
                           crossed by narrow
                           black streams, or canals, of the color of the peat. Growing by the banks were long
                           rows of stumpy
                           willow-trees, cut year by year for the sake of the osiers, which were sold to the
                           basket-makers.
                           Here and there, perhaps at the turn of the stream, some single tree had been allowed
                           to grow to its
                           natural dimensions, forming a sequestered nook where some of us used to bathe on hot
                           summer days.
                           Two young friends of my grandmother'sâ€”Laura and Pauline C.â€”were with us most of the
                           time we were <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="156" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span> living in this 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2032" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="it">villeggiatura</foreign>, and Pauline especially loved the water, and used to come home fresh
                           and smiling and pluming herself after her cool divings. Mennecy was a rural spot among
                           willow-trees,
                           a perfect retreat for hot weather.

                        <p id="d74890e2036">There was an old paved 
                           <hi id="d74890e2038" style="font-style: italic;">place</hi> in the centre of the village, leading to a fine old
                           church well served and well frequented, of which the Sunday bells clanged far across
                           the country. We
                           used to see the congregation assembling in cheerful companies, ar- riving from outlying
                           farms, and
                           greeting each other in the market-place before the mass began; a con- gregation with
                           more of talk
                           and animation than with us, with blue smocks and white linen 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2041" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">coiffes</foreign>, and picturesque country cloaks and 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2044" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">sabots</foreign>. We used somewhat ruefully to wish to follow Pauline and Louise (our cross
                           maid-of-all-work) through the swing-doors behind which the incense was tossing and
                           the organ rolling
                           out its triumphant fugue. A Roman Catholic service seems something of a high festival,
                           coming round
                           Sunday after Sunday, a rite bringing excitement and adoration along with it. Our own
                           village
                           church-bells also ring out, calling to the peaceful congregations; calling us to something
                           more
                           tranquil, more free, and more full of individual feelingâ€”to an aspiration rather than
                           to a rite.

                        <p id="d74890e2048">My grandparents' house had once been a hunting-lodge <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="157" data-tei-n="151"> </a></span> belonging to
                           Henry IV., who loved the neighborhood, and frequented CompiÃ¨gne long years before

                           Louis Napoleon, or the Emperor Napoleon III. and his courtiers, and their ladies in
                           hunting-costumes, and with spirited horses and 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2052" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">fanfarons</foreign>,
                           all followed the chase. I don't remember ever seeing any of them, but we had a general
                           impression
                           that those hunting companies were about, and any day a gay procession, not unlike
                           something out of a
                           fairy-tale, might come riding past our old gates. They were old creaking gates, which
                           had once been
                           green, now gray and weather-stained; our high walls, which had once been white, were
                           also green and
                           stained and overgrown by a vine. M. Roche had given us 
                           <title id="d74890e2055">Jocelyn</title> to read about a year
                           before, and I used to think of the description of the

                           vine-clad walls. There was an old well with a wrought-iron top to it and a rope, and
                           there was a
                           vine travelling along the margin and spreading beyond it, along the wrought-iron railing,
                           to the
                           pretty old iron gate dividing the court-yard from the old garden at the back, which,
                           with its
                           dainty, rusty iron scrolls, excluded the cocks and hens that flapped and picketed
                           and strutted all
                           day long in tile front court, and roosted at night in the great empty stables opposite

                        <p id="d74890e2064">The hunting-lodge, before it had become our home, had been turned into a farm; the
                           knights and
                           cavaliers had made way for blouses and cow-herds, and the hunters had given up their
                           stalls to heavy
                           cart-horses, though, indeed, there was room to spare for any number of either. But
                           the farmer died
                           in time, and his widow married the milkman, and she let the old place to my grandfather,
                           who had a
                           special purpose in coming to Mennecy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2067">A flight of stone steps led from the court-yard to the house, just as one sees in
                           Scotland, which
                           looks so like France in places. Our front windows opened on to a garden, and the passages
                           and the
                           sitting-rooms were panelled in some parts. We could walk all round the drawing-room
                           between the
                           panels and the walls; nor was it dark within the wainscot, for there were two little
                           windows at
                           either end to give light to the spiders and the active mice who chiefly frequented
                           this passage. The
                           floors were all of brick, on which we had laid a carpet, and my grandmother had brought
                           a blue sofa
                           and chairs from Paris, and hired a piano in Corbeil.

                           </said> our neighbor the Maire used to
                           say when he came in of an evening, bowing politely to the piano and then to us. Polished
                           rosewood!
                           ivory keys! gilt handles! He was genuine in his enthusiastic admiration. To hear <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="159" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span> him one would think there had never been such a piano since the world
                           began. It got very much out of tune, but that did not shake our faith in it. We gave
                           parties on the
                           strength of the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2078" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">charmant meuble</foreign>. Piano company (so we
                           considered ourselves) was not so very common in the neighborhood. Laura could play
                           (as she still
                           does) to the delight of her listeners; Pauline had a very sweet 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2081" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="it">mezzo soprano</foreign> voice, and used to sing to the piano and to us of summer evenings. M.
                           le Maire was also very fond of singing and of being accompanied. His wife was not
                           musical, but our
                           young ladies were very patient and kind, and used to repeat the more difficult passages
                           over and
                           over again for him, and try not to laugh when he went very much out of tune. My sister
                           and I used to
                           find the panelled passages a convenient retreat occasionally, when a note went very
                           wildly astray;
                           or we could always run out through the French windows into the garden, where the grasshoppers'
                           concert would also strike up of fine summer evenings, and seemed to whistle and spread
                           far, far
                           beyond the corn-fields and the poppy-heads. There was a terrace at the end of the
                           garden where a
                           pavilion stood overlooking the high-road, from which we could see the regiments as
                           they passed on
                           their way to Corbeil, and the dragoons watering their horses at the little village
                           inn. All along
                           this terrace grew pumpkin <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="160" data-tei-n="154"> </a></span> plants, which we scarcely noticed when
                           we first arrived, although we were full of admiration for the luxuriant vines hanging
                           from all the
                           walls, and of which one charming tunnelled avenue ran right across a corner of the
                           garden. Pauline
                           and I used to sit there that summer-time under the green shadows, making believe to
                           learn Italian
                           with Goldoni and a dictionaryâ€”that is to say, I was making believe; she not only learned
                           the
                           language, but married a Milanese gentleman in after-years. Only the other day, as
                           we sat entranced
                           by Madame Duse's gracious inspirations, I seemed for the first time to enter into
                           the real spirit of
                           those by-gone and almost forgotten studies. Goldoni suddenly came to life again, and
                           I thought of
                           the old green vine avenue, and the books I had been bored by as a girl began to speak
                           to me for the
                           first time. As the autumn went on myriads of wasps appeared; the grapes swelled and
                           turned to golden
                           sweetness; we used to go into the garden with hunches of bread, and gather our own
                           breakfasts and
                           luncheons growing on the walls. Along with the grapes came the pumpkins, and they
                           also grew.
                           Cinderella's were nothing to them; the huge balls came swelling and rolling down upon
                           us, coloring
                           and rising in every direction. We got frightened at lastâ€”it seemed wicked to waste
                           them; we boiled
                           them, we passed them through sieves, we steeped <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="161" data-tei-n="155"> </a></span> them in milk by
                           the Maire's advice. At the end of three or four days we absolutely loathed them. The
                           pigs of the
                           neighborhood, already satiated with pumpkin, refused to touch them any more. On the
                           fifth day a
                           neighbor sent us in a great basketful as a present. We were literally bombarded with
                           pumpkins that
                           year, but let us hope it was a specially good year for fruit.

                        <p id="d74890e2089">I said that my grandfather had a special purpose in view when he brought us to Mennecy.
                           Our dear
                           Colonel Newcome had a fancy that he could rehabilitate the family fortunes by establishing
                           a
                           manufactory for peat fuel, which was to be made by the help of an ingenious machine.
                           It had been
                           invented by an old friend, who had sold him the patent for a certain sum, and as a
                           special favor.
                           This same friend, who seems to have been ingenious, though an expensive acquaintance,
                           had also
                           invented a wooden horse, which was to supersede the usual living quadrupeds. It had
                           the great
                           advantage of only eating coal and coke, but I believe it was found all the same to
                           be much more
                           expensive than the real animal, and far less intelligent. I remember seeing the ingeniously
                           carved
                           hoofs of the wooden horse standing on the piano, with a drawing for his cast-iron
                           inside. I was only
                           once shown the peat-machine; it looked something like a stove, and used to be poked
                           by an old woman,
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="162" data-tei-n="156"> </a></span> while a little boy with a barrow brought up the peat, which
                           was then and there turned into black cakes. We never made our fortunes out of the
                           peat, but we
                           burned a great stack of it, which glowed bright and clear, and lasted through several
                           winters, and I
                           believe the whole thing was finally handed over to an experimentalist on the spot,
                           who may still be
                           there for all I know. He was a short and swarthy man, who used to come and bargain
                           in the
                           dining-room at enormous length.

                        <p id="d74890e2094">As my grandparents had spent several summers at Mennecy, they had made acquaintance
                           with the two or
                           three neighbors, and with the family at the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2096" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">chÃ¢teau</foreign>. We
                           used to pass the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2099" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">chÃ¢teau</foreign> when we walked along the
                           high-road, which was divided from the park by a wall. Here and there were iron gates,
                           through which
                           we could see into the shady avenues of poplar-trees and nut-trees, and in one place,
                           where an old
                           bridge crossed a stream, we caught sight of the old white house, with its shutters
                           and chimneys and
                           high slated roof. There had been another, a finer one, before this, we were told,
                           standing in a
                           different corner of the same park. A fine old gateway still remained with its heraldic
                           carvings and
                           mementos of the past, but the road had travelled on elsewhere, and no longer passed
                           under it, as it
                           did once long ago when the king's hunt used to come along the avenue, which now led
                           from nothing <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="163" data-tei-n="157"> </a></span> to nowhere. There is a description of this very place in Lucien
                           Perey's delightful

                              and was inhabited by the great MarÃ©chal de Villeroi," says the book. "Remy HÃ©nault
                              had a pretty
                              country-house at Ã‰ltioles [Ã‰tioles comes back to me with its willow-trees and dark
                              amber
                              canals]; it was the house that Madame de Pompadour afterwards lived in. HÃ©nault used
                              to spend
                              part of the year there, and as his son was fond of sport, he bought for him from the
                              MarÃ©chal de
                              Villeroi a rangership and the place of Governor of Corbeil. The old MarÃ©chal took
                              a fancy to
                              young HÃ©nault, and used to keep him to stay at the

                              district HÃ©nault often received the Dauphin, the Duke of Burgundy, and the Duke of
                              Berry, who
                              used to come with a small suite to Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. The Dauphin used to hunt
                              wolves,
                              accompanied by the ranger; the young princes only shot pheasants. It is curious nowadays
                              to
                              think of people hunting wolves at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges," continues Lucien Perey,
                              still
                              conjuring up my past for me, and then he gives a note, saying: "The remains of the
                              ChÃ¢teau de
                              Villeroi still exist on the right hand of the road from Corbeil to Mennecy, a road
                              which is
                              always called in the country ' La route de Villeroi.'"</q> And this was the road along which we
                           used to straggle of summer evenings.

                           Maire, and when we all went up to call with him one day, the younger members of the
                           party were not
                           without hopes of finding some companions there, for we had seen a girl of about our
                           own age, who
                           was, so the Maire told us, an heiress, and the only daughter of the house. As we walked
                           up through
                           the park we met the gardener, who left his work to escort us to the front door, calling
                           loudly to a
                           maid who sat darning stockings in the marble hall. She in turn put down her work and
                           disappeared
                           through a tall carved doorway, returning almost immediately to ask us to go in. We
                           found ourselves
                           in a big drawing-room with polished floors, and with many tall windows opening to
                           the garden; some
                           of them were shuttered and curtained, and the room was rather dark. In it sat, in
                           a semicircle with
                           chairs ready placed, the stout mother, the burly father, and the broad-shouldered
                           heiress in her
                           plaid frock. They received us very coldly, looking at us with curiosity and aloofness,
                           as if we had
                           been specimens of some strange, unknown race. I thought the gardener and the sewing-maid
                           also stared
                           at us, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="165" data-tei-n="159"> </a></span> when they returned, almost immediately, with trays of
                           refreshment-biscuits and glasses of beer, which were handed round already poured out.
                           I do not know
                           if this were a custom peculiar to the neighborhood, or only to this particular family.
                           The young
                           lady seemed surprised that we should refuse. 
                           <said id="d74890e2129">"What, English, and you do not take beer?"</said>
                           she said, placing her tumbler between her knees. Between her draughts she then went
                           on to ask us
                           many questions about that strange country to which we belonged, about our outlandish
                           ways and
                           singular habits. It was a very different catechism from M. Malan's. 
                           <said id="d74890e2133">"Did we ever go to church
                              at all?" "Did we ever say any prayers?" "Did not heretics fast every Sunday, instead
                              of making
                              it a fÃªte-day?" "Had we ever heard of the Virgin Mary [surprise expressed] and the
                              saints [more
                              surprise]?"
                           </said> Our friend the Maire saw with pain that we young ladies were not getting on,
                           and tried to bring the conversation round to other more congenial topics than those
                           fundamental
                           differences for which we should all have burned one another a century before; he therefore
                           introduced the piano by way of a diversion, the

                           but I came away all the same very much put out. It is disagreeable to be both damned
                           in the future
                           and looked down upon in the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="166" data-tei-n="160"> </a></span> present, as one belonging to an
                           ignorant and bar- barous race. I felt as if all the Catholic saints in Paradise, certainly
                           all the
                           French ones, were shrug- ging their shoulders at us when we came away, and I spoke
                           quite crossly to
                           M. le Maire when he asked me what I thought of the

                        <p id="d74890e2145">There used to be an odd stout figure walking about Mennecy in a workman's blouse and
                           loose trousers,
                           and with a cropped head of black hair and an old casquette. We were told that it was
                           a woman; and a
                           wholly supposititious impression once arose in some one's mind that it might have
                           been George Sand
                           herself. I passed quite close by on one occasion, when the mysterious personage looked
                           round and
                           then turned away, and I thrilled from head to foot. How odd those mysterious moments
                           are when
                           nothing seems to be happening, but which nevertheless go on all the rest of one's
                           life. I saw a
                           face, stolid and sad, giving me an impression of pain and long endurance which comes
                           back still. It
                           seemed to be a woman's face, flabby and tanned, not old. There was no gayety in it,
                           no adventure in
                           the eyes; but expiation, endurance, defiance, I know not what tragedy, was expressed
                           by that
                           thickset, downcast figure. I have now, alas, no doubt that it was not George Sand.
                           I had not read
                           any of her books then, but we had many things to read besides in the old garden. There
                           were various
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="167" data-tei-n="161"> </a></span>IN VILLEGGIATURA books my father had given us and told us to
                           read during his absence, Macaulay's

                           <title id="d74890e2152">Pendennis</title>, which I had brought away from home, and which has always seemed to me
                           more like hearing him talk than any other of his books; and, above all, there were
                           his letters which
                           came from time to time. He was giving lectures at Manchester and elsewhere before
                           sailing for
                           America, and there is one of his letters folded in three, and addressed on the back
                           to my sister at
                           Mennecy, Seine-et-Oise.

                              when I
                              broke down in a speech before 3000 ladies and gentlemen. I felt very foolish, but
                              I tried again
                              at night and did better, and as there is nothing more wicked in breaking down in a
                              speech than
                              in slipping on a bit of orange-peel and breaking one's nose, why, I got up again,
                              and made
                              another speech at night without breaking down. It's all custom, and most people can

                              was very much annoyed, and he said to me:

                           and there Mr. Bright told me another little anecdote of my father, whom he had met

                           before his death at the Reform Club. He said that as he was passing through the hall,
                           he met him
                           standing in his way and he stepped back, took off his hat, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="169" data-tei-n="163"> </a></span> and

                        <p id="d74890e2192">When my father sailed for America, people were very kind to us, and wrote to us with
                           news of him.
                           
                           <title id="d74890e2194">Esmond</title> came for my grandmother, and a box which we received at Paris puzzled us
                           very much, and delighted us no less than it puzzled us. It contained a magnificent
                           iced cake,
                           anonymously and carefully packed with strips of many-colored paper. It was not my
                           father who had
                           sent it, as we imagined, nor was it till long afterwards that we discovered that the
                           sender was Mrs.
                           Procter. Many things are remembered of her, but how many kind deeds there have been
                           of hers without
                           a name to them!

                        <p id="d74890e2198">Once the letters began to arrive from America we were all much happier, for we seemed
                           in touch with
                           him once more, and to know what was happening. He was fairly well and in good spirits,
                           and making
                           friends and making money. I remember his writing home on one occasion and asking us
                           to send him out
                           a couple of new stomachs, so hospitable were his friends over the water, so numerous
                           the dinners and
                           suppers to which he was invited. When the long summer and winter were over, and the
                           still longer
                           spring, suddenly one day we <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="170" data-tei-n="164"> </a></span> heard that he was coming back much
                           sooner than he expected. I believe he saw a steamer starting for home and could stand
                           it no longer,
                           and then and there came off.

                        <p id="d74890e2203">I can still remember sitting with my grandparents, expecting his return. My sister
                           and I sat on the
                           red sofa in the little study, and shortly before the time we had calculated that he
                           might arrive
                           came a little ring at the front-door bell. My grandmother broke down; my sister and
                           I rushed to the
                           front door, only we were so afraid that it might not be he that we did not dare to
                           open it, and
                           there we stood until a second and much louder ringing brought us to our senses. 
                           <said id="d74890e2205">"Why didn't
                              you open the door?"
                           </said> said my father, stepping in, looking well, broad, and upright,
                           laughing. In a moment he had never been away at all.

                        <p id="d74890e2225">AFTER his return from America my father took an apartment in Paris for the autumn
                           months, and it was
                           then that he told us he had made a plan for wintering in Rome. It almost seems to
                           me now that all
                           the rest of my life dates in some measure from those old Roman days, which were all
                           the more vivid
                           because my sister and I were still spectators and not yet actors in the play. I was
                           just fifteen, my
                           sister was still a little girl, but I thought myself a young woman. I have written
                           elsewhere of Mrs.
                           Kemble and Mrs. Sartoris and the Brownings, who were all living at Rome that winter,
                           with a number
                           of interesting people, all drinking, as we were about to do, of the waters of Trevi.
                           How few of us
                           returned to the fountain! But the proverb, I think, must apply to one's spiritual
                           return. For,
                           though one may drink and drink, and go back again and again, it is ever a different
                           person that
                           stands by the fountain, whereas the shadowy self by the Atone basin, bending over
                           the rushing water,
                           is the same, and does not change.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2229">We started early in December, my father, my <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="174" data-tei-n="168"> </a></span> sister, and I. He had
                           his servant with him, for already his health had begun to fail him. We reached Marseilles
                           in bitter
                           weather late one night. We laid our travelling plaids upon our beds to keep ourselves
                           warm, but
                           though we shivered, our spirits rose to wildest pitch next morning in the excitement
                           of the golden
                           moment. The wonderful sights in the streets are before me stillâ€”the Jews, Turks, dwellers
                           in
                           Mesopotamia, chattering in gorgeous colors and strange languages; the quays with their
                           crowded
                           shipping and the amethyst water. I can still see, in a sort of mental picture, a barge
                           piled with
                           great golden onions floating along one of the quays, guided by a lonely woman in blue
                           rags with a
                           colored kerchief on her head. 
                           <said id="d74890e2233">"There goes the Lady of Shalot,"</said> said my father; and when
                           we looked at him rather puzzled, for we knew nothing of onions and very little of
                           Tennyson in those
                           days, he explained that a shalot was a species of onion, and after a moment's reflection
                           we took in
                           his little joke, feeling that nobody ever thought of such droll things as he did.
                           Then we reached
                           our hotel again, where there were Turks still drinking coffee under striped awnings,
                           and a black man
                           in a fez, and a lank British diplomat, with a very worn face, who knew my father,
                           arriving from some
                           outlandish place with piles of luggage; and we caught sight of the master of the hotel
                           and his
                           family <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="175" data-tei-n="169"> </a></span> gathered round a soup-tureen in a sort of glass
                           conservatory, and so went up-stairs to rest and refresh ourselves before our start
                           that evening. All
                           this splendor and novelty and 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2238" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="la">lux mundi</foreign> had turned our
                           heads, for we forgot our warm wraps and half our possessions at the hotel, and did
                           not discover,
                           till long after the steamer had started with all of us on board, how many essentials
                           we had left
                           behind.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2242">The sun was setting as we steamed out of Marseilles, and the rocky island of If stood
                           out dark and
                           crisp against the rush of bright wavelets, across which we strained our eyes to see
                           Monte Cristo in
                           his sack splashing into the water of the bay. Then we got out to sea, and the land
                           disappeared by
                           degrees. How the stars shone that night on board the big ship! The passengers were
                           all on deck
                           talking in a pleasant murmur of voices, broken by laughs and exclamations. Among them
                           were some
                           people who specially attracted us, a very striking and beautiful quartet from the
                           north. There was a
                           lovely mother, oldish, widowed, but very beautiful still; the two charming daughters,
                           one tall and
                           lovely, the other a piquante brunette; there was the son, one of the handsomest young
                           men I have
                           ever seen. They were going to Rome, they told us, for the winter. Christina, the eldest
                           girl, was
                           dressed in white. She seemed to me some fair Urania, controlling the stars in their
                           wondrous maze as
                           she and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="176" data-tei-n="170"> </a></span> I and my sister paced the deck till it was very late, and
                           some bell sounded, and my father came up and sent us down to our cabin. Then the night
                           turned bitter
                           cold, and, as we had left our shawls on the shores of France, we made haste to get
                           to bed and to be
                           warm. Though it was cold, we liked fresh air and were glad to find that our port-holes
                           had been left
                           open by the steward; we scrambled into our berths, and fell asleep. I lay at the top,
                           and my sister
                           in the berth below. How well I remember waking suddenly in a slop of salt-water! The
                           ship was
                           sinking, we were all going to be drowned, and with a wild shriek calling to my sister
                           I sprang from
                           the cabin and rushed up the companion-steps on deck. I thought she called me back,
                           but I paid no
                           heed as I reached the top of the companion-ladder, dripping and almost in tears, with
                           my fatal
                           announcement. There I encountered the steward, who began to laugh, and who led me
                           back crest-fallen
                           to our cabin, at the door of which my sister was standing. The water was dancing in,
                           in a stream,
                           and the steward scolded us well as he screwed up the port-holes and got us some dry
                           bedding. Next
                           morning, to my inexpressible mortification, I heard some people telling the story.
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2246">"She rushed
                              on deck, and declared the ship was sinking,"
                           </said> said one voice to another. I didn't wait to
                           hear any more, but fled.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d74890e2252">The wind went down again, but it was still bitter cold, and we shivered without our
                           wraps, as we
                           steamed up to Genoa along the spreading quays with their background of gorgeous palaces
                           and
                           cloud-capped towers. There were convicts in their chains at work upon the great steps
                           of the quay,
                           who stared at us as we landed. And the very first thing which happened to us when
                           we found ourselves
                           in Italy at lastâ€”the land where citrons bloom, where orange flowers scent the airâ€”was
                           that we drove
                           straight away to a narrow back street, where we were told we should find a shop for
                           English goods,
                           and then and there my father bought us each a warm gray wrap, with stripes of black,
                           nothing in the
                           least Italian or romantic, but the best that we could get. And then, as we had now
                           a whole day to
                           spend on shore, and shawls to keep us warm, we drove about the town, and after visiting
                           a palace or
                           two took the railway, which had been quite lately opened to Pisa. The weather must
                           have changed as
                           the day went on, for it was sunshine, not Shetland wool, that warmed us at last; but
                           the wind was
                           blowing still, and what I specially remember in the open Piazza at Pisa is the figure
                           of a stately
                           monk, whose voluminous robes were fluttering and beating as he passed us, wrapped
                           in darkness,
                           mystical, majestic, with all the light beyond his stateliness and the cathedral in
                           its <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="178" data-tei-n="172"> </a></span> glory and the Leaning Tower aslant in the sunlight for a background.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2257">Our adventures for the day were not yet over. At the station we found two more of
                           the ship's
                           passengers, young men with whom we had made acquaintance, and we all returned to Genoa
                           together. The
                           train was late, and we had to be on board at a certain time, so that we engaged a
                           carriage, and
                           drove quickly to the quay, where the convicts clanking in their chains were still
                           at work. A boat
                           was found, rowed by some sailors who certainly did not wear chains, but who were otherwise
                           not very
                           unlike those industrious convicts in appearance. The bargain was made, we entered
                           the boat all five,
                           and as we were getting in we could see our great ship in the twilight looking bigger
                           than ever, and
                           one rocket and then another going off towards the dawning stars. 
                           <said id="d74890e2259">"They are signalling for
                              us,"
                           </said> said one of our companions; 
                           <said id="d74890e2262">"we shall soon be on board."</said>

                        <p id="d74890e2265">We had rowed some twenty strokes from the shore by this time, when suddenly the boatmen
                           left off
                           rowing; they put down their oars, and one of them began talking volubly, though I
                           could not
                           understand what he said. "What's to be done ?" said one of the young men to my father.
                           "They say
                           they won't go on unless we give them fifty francs more," and he began shaking his
                           head and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="173"> </a></span> remonstrating in broken Italian. The boatmen paid no attention,
                           shrugged their shoulders, and waited, as if they were determined never to row another
                           stroke. Then
                           the steamer sent up two more rockets, which rose through the twilight, bidding us
                           hurry; and then
                           suddenly my father rose up in the stern of the boat where he was sitting, and standing
                           tall and
                           erect, and in an anger such as I had never seen him in before or after in all my life,
                           he shouted
                           out in loud and indignant English, " Dâ€”-n you, go on!" a simple malediction which
                           carried more force
                           than all the Italian polysyllables and expostulations of our companions. To our surprise
                           and great
                           relief, the men seemed frightened, and took to their oars again and began to row,
                           grumbling and
                           muttering. When we got on board the ship, they told us it was a well-known trick the
                           Genoese boatmen
                           were in the habit of playing upon travellers, and that they would have sent a boat
                           for us if we had
                           delayed any longer.

                           This land- ing
                           was no less wonderful than everything else, we thought, as we looked in awe at the
                           glorious blaze of
                           color, at the square Campanile with its flat tilted roof, and at all that we were

                           with fancy-dress
                           babies, all laughing, talking in Italian, and at home in Italy. We had some trouble
                           in getting our
                           luggage through the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2278" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="it">dogana</foreign>. Most of the other travellers
                           started before we did, and we were among the last to start for Rome. My father was
                           anxious to get
                           on, for there were unpleasant rumors about brigands on the road. Another family (Russians)
                           with a
                           courier and a great deal of luggage was to follow us, and some one suggested we should
                           wait for
                           their escort; but, on the whole, my father decided to start. The afternoon shadows
                           were beginning to
                           lengthen, when at length we were packed and ready. We had a mouldy post-chaise, with
                           a gray ragged
                           lining, and our luggage on the top. We hoped to get to Rome before dark. I remember
                           thrilling as my
                           father buttoned his overcoat and told us he had put his hundred louis for safety into
                           an inner
                           pocket.

                        <p id="d74890e2282">The country is not very beautiful between Civita Vecchia and Romeâ€”at least, I do not
                           remember
                           anything to distract our attention fromour alarms. We were just frightened enough
                           to be stimulated
                           and amused as we jolted past the wide fields where the men were at work. We sat all
                           three abreast in
                           the jolting old carriage. My father's servant was on the box. We were reading our
                           Tauchnitz <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="181" data-tei-n="181"> </a></span>TOUT CHEMIN books, being tired of watching the flat horizons, when
                           suddenly the carriage stopped, and Charles Pearman, with a pale face of alarm, came
                           to the window
                           and said that one of the traces had broken, and that there were a number of people
                           all coming round
                           the carriage. We were surrounded by people as if by magic-satyrs, shepherds, strange
                           bearded
                           creatures with conical hats, and with pitch-forks in their hands. The sun was just
                           setting, and
                           dazzling into our faces all the time. For some five minutes we waited, looking at
                           each other in
                           silence, and wondering what was going to come next. At the end of that time, and after
                           a good deal
                           of conversation with the postilions, the satyrs and fauns went their way with their
                           pitchforks,
                           leaving us, to our inexpressible relief, to continue our journey. Then came the dusk
                           at last, and
                           the road seemed longer and longer. I think I had fallen asleep in my corner, when
                           my father put his
                           hand on my shoulder. 
                           <said id="d74890e2286">"Look!"</said> he said; and I looked, and, lo! there rose the dusky dome
                           of St. Peter's gray upon the dark-blue sky.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2290">Very soon afterwards some one with a lantern opened the gates of Rome and examined
                           our passport, and
                           let us in. We drove to our hotel in the Via Condotti, and when we awoke it was to
                           the sound of
                           countless church bells in the morning light.

                        <p id="d74890e2295">When we leaned from the window of our entresol sitting-room, with its odd yellow walls,
                           we could
                           almost touch the heads of the passers-by. It was Sunday morning; all the bells were
                           flinging and
                           ringing, and they seemed to be striking and vibrating against that wonderful blue
                           sky overhead. How
                           well I remember my first Roman contadina as she walked majestically along the street
                           belowâ€”black-haired, white-becapped, white-besleeved, and covered with ornamentsâ€”on
                           her way to
                           mass.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2298">The Piazza d'Espagna, at the end of our street, was one flood, of sunshine, in which
                           other 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2300" xml:lang="it">contadinas</foreign> and

                           shepherds were all floating when we came out to look and to wonder. Wonderful as it
                           all was, it
                           seemed also almost disappointing. We had expected, we didn't know what ; and this
                           was 
                           <hi id="d74890e2306" style="font-style: italic;">something</hi>â€”something tangible, appreciable, and, so far, less than we expected. "Wait a
                           little," said my father; " people are always a little disappointed when they first
                           come to
                           Rome."

                        <p id="d74890e2311">I remember long after hearing Mr. Appleton, that wise and witty American, say, 
                           <said id="d74890e2313">"People expect
                              to taste the result of two thousand years of civilization in a morning. It takes more
                              than a
                              morning to receive so much into one's mind ... a life- time is not too long."
                           </said> Mr.
                           Appleton was right when he said it takes a lifetime to realize some ideas. But now
                           and then one

                           minute; land those two months at Rome, short as they were, have lasted my lifetime.
                           The people, the
                           sights, the sounds, have never quite ceased for me yet. They have become an habitual
                           association,
                           and have helped to make that mental standard by which one habitually measures the
                           events as they
                           follow one another.

                           in the dark vaulted dining-room, all the people, I remember, were talking confusedly
                           of an attack by
                           brigands upon some Russians on the road from Civita Vecchiaâ€”the very vagueness of
                           the rumor made it
                           the more impressive to us. There is a letter from my father which he must have written
                           to his mother
                           the very next day; it is dated HÃ´tel Franz, via Condotti, December 6. <q style=" display: inline; ">"We have very comfortable

                              handsome. The front is positively ugly, that is certain, but nevertheless the city
                              is
                              glorious. We had a famous walk on the Pincio, and the sun set for us with a splendor

                              imperial. I wasn't sorry when the journey from Civita Vecchia was over. Having eighty

                        <p id="d74890e2338">Very soon our friends began to appearâ€”Mr. Browning, Mr. Sartoris, Mr. Eneas Macbean.
                           Mr. Macbean was
                           the English banker. He was the kindest of bankers, and used to send us piles of the
                           most delightful
                           books to read. Lockhart's Scott and Bulwer's heroes and Disraeli's saint-like politicians
                           all came
                           to inhabit our 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2340" xml:lang="it">palazzo</foreign>, when we were established there. Zanoni and
                           that cat-like spirit of the threshold are as vivid to me as any of the people who
                           used to come to
                           dinner. We met our late fellow-travellers (who now also seemed like old friends) hurrying
                           about in
                           search of lodgings; we stood under the great dome of St. Peter's; we saw the Tiber
                           rushing under its
                           bridges; then, no doubt in consequence of the scorpions, we went about to look for
                           lodgings, and it
                           was Mr. Browning who told us where to go. One can hardly imagine a more ideal spot
                           for little girls
                           to live in than that to which he directed usâ€”to a great apartment over <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="185" data-tei-n="179"> </a></span> the pastry-cook's in the Palazzo Poniatowski, in the Via Della Croce. We
                           climbed a broad stone stair-case with a handsome wrought-iron banister, we clanged
                           at an echoing
                           bell, and a little old lady in a camisole, rejoicing in the imposing name of Signora
                           Ercole, opened
                           the door, and showed us into a dark outer hall. Then she led the way from room to
                           room, until we
                           finally reached a drawing-room with seven windows, at which we exclaimed in preliminary
                           admiration.
                           Among the other items of Sour installation were a Chinese museum, a library, a dining-room
                           with a
                           brazen charcoal-burner in the centre, and besides all these we were to have a bed-room,
                           a
                           dressing-room, and a cupboard for my father's servant. My father took the dressing-room
                           for himself.
                           He put me and my sister into the big bedroom to the front, and the man retired to
                           the cupboard in
                           the hall. Signora Ercole, our land-lady, also hospitably offered us the run of her
                           own magnificent
                           sitting-rooms, besides the four or five we had engaged. I have a vague impression
                           of her family of
                           daughters, also in camisoles, huddled away into some humbler apartment, but we saw
                           little of them.
                           We established ourselves in one corner of the great drawing-room, clearing an inlaid
                           table of its
                           lamps and statuettes, its wax flowers, and other adornments. Then we felt at home.
                           A stone-mason
                           suspended at his work began to sing in <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="186" data-tei-n="180"> </a></span> mid-air just outside one
                           of the windows, there came to us the sound of the 
                           <hi id="d74890e2347" style="font-style: italic;">pfifferari</hi> from the piazza down
                           below, and the flutter of the white doves' wings and their flying shadows upon the
                           floor, to- gether
                           with a scent of flowers and sense of foun- tains, and the fusty, fascinating smell
                           from the old
                           hangings and bric-Ã -brac. I think the Ercoles must have done some business as 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2350" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">brocanteurs</foreign>, for the fur- niture was more like that of a museum than a hu-
                           man living-house; all over the walls they had rows of paintings in magnificent gildings,
                           of which
                           the frames were the most important parts. All the same, the whole effect was imposing
                           and
                           delightful, and we felt like enchanted princesses in a palace, and flew from room
                           to room.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2354">About luncheon-time my father sent us down to the pastry-cook's shop, where we revelled
                           among cream
                           tarts and 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2356" xml:lang="fr">petits fours</foreign>, and then we ordered our dinner, as people
                           did then, from a 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2359" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="it">trattoria</foreign> near at hand. Then we went out
                           again, still in our raptures, and when dinner-time came, just about sunset, excitement
                           had given us
                           good appetites, notwithstanding the tarts. We were ready, but dinner delayed. We waited
                           more and
                           more impatiently as the evening advanced, but still no dinner appeared. Then the English
                           servant,
                           Charles, was called, and despatched to the cook-shop to make inquiry. He came back
                           much agitated,
                           saying the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="187" data-tei-n="181"> </a></span> dinner had been sentâ€”that they assured him it had been
                           sent! It had apparently vanished on its way up the old palace stairs. 
                           <said id="d74890e2364">"Go back,"</said> said
                           my father, 
                           <said id="d74890e2367">"and tell them there is some mistake, and that we are very hungry, and waiting
                              still."
                           </said> The man left the room, then returned again with a doubtful look. There was a sort
                           of box came an hour ago, he said: 
                           <said id="d74890e2371">"I have not opened it, sir."</said> With a rush my sister
                           and I flew into the hall, and there, sure enough, stood a square, solid iron box with
                           a hinged top.
                           It certainly looked very unlike dinner, but we raised it with faint hopes, which were
                           not
                           disappointed! Inside, and smoking still upon the hot plates, was spread a meal like
                           something in a
                           fairy-taleâ€”roast birds and dressed meat, a loaf of brown bread and competes of fruit,
                           and a salad
                           and a bottle of wine, to which good fare we immediately sat down in cheerful excitementâ€”our
                           first
                           Roman family meal together.

                        <p id="d74890e2375">When people write of the past, those among us who have reached a certain age are sometimes
                           apt to
                           forget that it is because so much of it still exists in our lives that it is so dear
                           to us. And, as
                           I have said before, there is often a great deal more of the past in the future than
                           there was in the
                           past itself at the time. We go back to meet our old selves, more tolerant, forgiving
                           our own
                           mistakes, understanding it all better, appreciating its simple joys <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="188" data-tei-n="182"> </a></span> and realities. There are compensations for the loss of youth and fresh impressions;
                           and one
                           learns little by little that a thing is not over because it is not happening with
                           noise and shape or
                           outward sign; its roots are in our hearts, and every now and then they send forth
                           a shoot which
                           blossoms and bears fruit still.

                        <p id="d74890e2380">Early life is like a chapter out of Dickens, I thinkâ€” one 
                           <hi id="d74890e2382" style="font-style: italic;">sees</hi> people then; their
                           tricks of expression, their vivid sayings, and their quaint humors and oddities do
                           not surprise one;
                           one accepts every-thing as a matter of courseâ€”no matter how unusual it may be. Later
                           in life one
                           grows more fas- tidious, more ambitious, more paradoxical; one begins to judge, or
                           to make excuses,
                           or to think about one's companions instead of merely staring at them. All the people
                           we now saw for
                           the first time=-vivid but mysterious apparitions; we didn't know what they were feeling
                           and thinking
                           about, only we saw them, and very delightful they all were to look at.

                        <p id="d74890e2387">Meanwhile our education was not neglected. We had a poetess to teach us a little Italian,
                           a signora
                           with a magnificent husband in plaid trousers, to whom I am sure she must have written
                           many poems.
                           Once she asked us to spend an evening in her apartment. It was high up in a house
                           in a narrow
                           street, bare and swept, and we found a company whose conversation (notwithstanding
                           all <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="189" data-tei-n="183"> </a></span> Madame Eleonora Torti's instructions) was quite unintelligble to us. We
                           all sat in a circle round a great brass brazier in the centre of the bare room. Every
                           now and then
                           the host took up an iron bar and stirred the caldron round, and the fumes arose. Two
                           or three of the
                           elder people sat in a corner playing cards-but here'also we were at fault. The cards
                           represented
                           baskets of flowers, coins, nuts, unknown and mysterious devices; among which the familiar
                           ace of
                           diamonds was the only sign we could recognize.

                        <p id="d74890e2392">After these social evenings our man used to come to fetch us home, through moonlight
                           streets, past
                           little shrines with burning lamps, by fountains plashing in the darkness. We used
                           to reach our great
                           staircase, hurry up half frightened of ghosts and echoes, but, being too much alive
                           ourselves to go
                           quickly to sleep, we opened Mr. Macbean's fascinating book, read by the light of our
                           flaring candles
                           long after we had heard our father's door shut and till the bell of the Frate in the
                           convent close
                           by began to toll.

                           who was born in 1809. The mentions of
                           the Kemble family in a diary which he kept about that time are very constant. <q style=" display: inline; ">"Called at

                           he turned, taking us with him into the old <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="194" data-tei-n="188"> </a></span> Assembly Rooms, where
                           I heard for the first and only time in all my life a Shakesperean reading by Mrs.
                           Fanny Kemble. I
                           think it was the first time I ever saw her. She came in with a stiff and stately genuflection
                           to the
                           audience, took her seat at the little table prepared for her, upon which she laid
                           her open book, and
                           immediately began to read. My sister and I sat on either side of our father. He followed
                           every word
                           with attention; I cannot even make.sure of the play after all these years, but Falstaff
                           was in it,
                           and with a rout and a shout a jolly company burst in. Was it Falstaff and his companions,
                           or were
                           they "<q style=" display: inline; ">Fairies, black, gray, green, and white, You moonshine revellersâ€”"?</q></p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2441">Suddenly the lady's voice rose, with some generous cheery chord of glorious fun and
                           jollity. I can
                           hear the echo still and see her action as she pointed outwards with both open hands,
                           and my father,
                           with a start, bursting into sympathizing laughter and plaudit, began crying 
                           <said id="d74890e2443">"Bravo!
                              Bravo!"
                           </said> and then again he sat listening and looking approvingly through his spectacles.
                           As we came away he once more broke into praise. 
                           <said id="d74890e2446">"Don't you see how admirably she forgets
                              herself?"
                           </said> he said; 
                           <said id="d74890e2449">"how she throws herself into it all? how finely she feels
                              it?"
                           </said> My father was the best of audiences, a born critic <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="195" data-tei-n="189"> </a></span> and yet an enthusiast; and to the last he could throw himself into the passing mood,
                           into the
                           spirit of the moment, while at the same time he knew what it was he was admiring,
                           and why he
                           admired.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2455">Some years passed before we met Mrs. Kemble again, in Rome. It was at a very hard
                           and difficult hour
                           of her life, so I have heard her say, a time when she needed all her courage to endure
                           her daily
                           portion of suffering. I was then a hobbledehoy, and (though she was no less kind to
                           me then than in
                           later years) I only stared and wondered at her ways, asking myself what she meant,
                           and how much she
                           meant by the things she said; but when I, too, was an older woman the scales fell
                           from my eyes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2458">One had to learn something one's self before one could in the least appreciate her.
                           When the gods
                           touch one's hair with gray, then comes some compensating revelation of what has been
                           and still is.
                           Now I can understand the passionate way in which Mrs. Kemble used in early times to
                           speak of
                           slavery; then I used to wonder, nor realize in the least what she felt, when she would
                           sometimes
                           start to her feet in agitation and passionate declamation; she who with streaming
                           eyes and wrung
                           heart had walked about the plantations feeling more, perhaps, than any slave could
                           do what it was to
                           be a slave. To her free and ruling nature every hour of bondage <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="196" data-tei-n="90"> </a></span>
                           must have seemed nothing short of torture. In those far-back Roman days of which I
                           have been
                           writing, she used to take us out driving with her from time to time. 
                           <said id="d74890e2462">"Where shall I drive
                              to?"
                           </said> asked the coachman. 
                           <said id="d74890e2465">"
                              <foreign id="d74890e2467" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="it">Andate al
                                 Diavolo

                           </said> said Mrs. Kemble, gayly. 
                           <said id="d74890e2471">"Go where you will, only
                              go!"
                           </said> And away we drive through the streets, and out by garden walls and garden gates to
                           the Campagna, and as we drive along she begins to sing to us. I could box my own past
                           ears for
                           wondering what the passers-by would think of it, instead of enjoying that by-gone
                           song.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2475">I can also remember Mrs. Kemble sitting dressed in a black dress silently working
                           all through the
                           evening by her sister's fireside, and gravely stitching on and on, while all the brilliant
                           company
                           came and went, and the music came and went. In those days Mrs. Kemble had certain
                           dresses which she
                           wore in rotation whatever the occasion might be. If the black gown chanced to fall
                           upon a gala-day
                           she wore it, if the pale silk gown fell upon a working-day she wore it; and I can
                           still hear an
                           American girl exclaiming with dismay as the delicate folds of a white silk embroidered
                           with flowers
                           went sweeping over the anemones in the Pamphili Gardens. Another vivid impression
                           I have is of an
                           evening visit Mrs. Kemble paid Mrs. Browning in the quiet little room in the Bocca
                           di Leone, only
                           lit <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="197" data-tei-n="191"> </a></span> by a couple of tapers and by the faint glow of the fire. I
                           looked from one to the other: Mrs. Browning welcoming her guest, dim in her dusky
                           gown unrelieved;
                           Mrs. Kemble upright and magnificent, robed on this occasion like some Roman' empress
                           in stately
                           crimson edged with gold. It happened to be the red-dress day, and she wore it. 
                           <said id="d74890e2479">"How do you
                              suppose I could have lived my life,"
                           </said> I once heard her say, 
                           <said id="d74890e2482">"if I had not lived by
                              rule, if I had not made laws for myself and kept to them?"
                           </said> Out of this stress of feeling,
                           out of this passionate rebellion against fate, she grew to the tender, the noble and
                           spirited
                           maturity of her later days. In time, by habit and degrees, we learn to understand
                           a little more how
                           to fit ourselves to circumstances, and life begins to seem possible and to contain
                           certain elements
                           of peace and of philosophy; it is in mid-life when we try to accommodate our own wants
                           and wishes to
                           those of others that the strain is greatest and the problem occasionally passes beyond
                           our powers of
                           solution. Indeed, very few solutions are possible, though wise compromises exist for
                           us all. Some
                           are more adaptable than others, and not having very positive selves to manage, having
                           impressions
                           rather than strong convictions to act upon, they run fairly well along other people's
                           lines; but
                           when strong feeling, vivid realizations, passionate love of truth and justice, uncompromising
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="198" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span> faith exist, then experience becomes hard indeed. When Mrs.
                           Kemble went to her rest only the other day, few among the critics who spoke so inadequately
                           of that
                           great personality, who wrote their conventional praise or indiscriminating blame,
                           had come into
                           touch with the magnetism of her personal inspiration. One only, her own and her daughter's
                           personal
                           friend, Mr. Henry James, to whom she turned with confidence and love to the very last,
                           has found
                           words to write that of h<q style=" display: inline; ">er which those who knew her best will best appreciate. "A prouder nature
                              never fronted the long humiliation of life,"</q> he says, touching upon the more tragic side of
                           her history.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2491">One should have a different language to speak with of each of those one has loved
                           and admired in
                           turn. Such a language exists in one's heart, but how can one translate it into print?
                           Some people
                           seem like green places in the desert; one thinks of them, and one is at rest. It is
                           also true that
                           there exist a certain number who oppress one with nameless discouragement, bores past
                           and present.
                           But the Elect are those who put life into one, who give courage to the faint-hearted,
                           hope out of
                           their own hearts' constancy; to these Fanny Kemble belonged indeed. To the end she
                           retained the
                           power of making new friends, of being loved by them and of loving them. One member
                           of my own family,
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="199" data-tei-n="193"> </a></span> whom the elder lady was pleased to christen Rosalind, only
                           knew her when she was long past seventy years of age, but what a true and spontaneous
                           friendship was
                           that which sprang up between them both, one which added, so wrote Mrs. Wister, to
                           the happiness of
                           her mother's later years. Mrs. Kemble returned love with love in full measure, whether
                           it came to
                           her in the shape of beautiful white azaleas from an old friend's hand, or of music
                           played so as to
                           delight her fine taste, or even as

                        <p id="d74890e2500">I once went out shopping with her one spring morning when she thought her room would
                           look the
                           brighter for muslin curtains to admit the light. She carried a long purse full of
                           sovereigns in her
                           hand. We drove to Regent Street to a shop where she told me her mother and her aunt
                           used both to go.
                           It may have been over that very counter that the classic <q style=" display: inline; ">"Will it wash?"</q> was uttered. The
                           shopman, who had assuredly not served Mrs. Siddons or he would have learned his lesson
                           earlier in
                           life, produced silken hangings and worsted and fabrics of various hues and textures
                           to Mrs. Kemble's
                           great annoyance. I had gone to another counter and came back to find her surrounded
                           by draperies,
                           sitting on her chair and looking very serious; distant thunder seemed in the air.
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2505">"Young

                              <hi id="d74890e2512" style="font-style: italic;">me</hi> my time is of great value. I shall thank you
                              to show me the things I asked for instead of all these things for which I 
                              <hi id="d74890e2515" style="font-style: italic;">did not
                                 ask

                           </said> and she flashed such a glance at him as must have surprised the youth. He
                           looked perfectly scared, seemed to leap over the counter, and the muslin curtains
                           appeared on the
                           spot.

                        <p id="d74890e2520">Mrs. Kemble once asked me suddenly what color her eyes were, and confused and unready
                           I answered,
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2522">"Light eyes."</said> At the moment indeed they looked like amber, not unlike the eyes of
                           some of those captive birds one sees in their cages sitting alone in the midst of
                           crowds. Mrs.
                           Kemble laughed at my answer. 
                           <said id="d74890e2525">"Light eyes! Where are your own? Do you not know that I have been
                              celebrated for my dark eyes?"
                           </said> she said; and then I looked again and they were dark and
                           brilliant, and looking at me with a half-amused, half-reproachable earnestness.

                        <p id="d74890e2529">It must have been in the early years of the century that Sir Thomas Lawrence sketched
                           that well-known
                           and most charming head of Mrs. Fanny Kemble with which we are most of us acquainted.
                           The oval face,
                           the dark eyes, the wise young brows, the glossy profusion of dark hair, represent
                           her youth; she was
                           no less striking in her age, though <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="201" data-tei-n="195"> </a></span> no great painter ever
                           depicted it. She grew to be old indeed, but it was only for a little while that she
                           was an old
                           woman. Stately, upright, ruddy and brown of complexion, almost to the very last;,
                           mobile and
                           expressive in feature, reproachful, mocking, and humorous, heroic, uplifted in turn.
                           This was no old
                           woman, feeling the throb of life with an intensity far beyond that of younger people,
                           splendid in
                           expression, vehement, and yet at times tender with a tenderness such as is very rare.
                           She was indeed
                           one of those coming from the mountain, one of the bearers of good tidings. As a girl
                           I used to watch
                           Mrs. Kemble stitching at her worsted work, and so in later days we have all seen her;
                           sitting in her
                           arm-chair, dressed in her handsome black silk Paris dress and lace cap. She sits upright
                           by the
                           window, with flowers on the table beside her, while her birds are pecking in their
                           cage. For a long
                           time she kept and tended certain American mocking-birds, letting them out of their
                           cages to fly
                           about the room, and perch here and there upon the furniture. 
                           <said id="d74890e2533">"I have no right,"</said> she
                           used to say, 
                           <said id="d74890e2536">"to inflict the annoyance of my pleasures upon my servants, and therefore I
                              attend to my birds and their requirements myself."
                           </said> She emphasizes her words as she sits
                           at work, stitching in the long colored threads with extra point as she speaks, or
                           again, when she is
                           interested in what she <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="196"> </a></span> says, putting down her tapestry and
                           looking straight into your face, as she explains her meaning directly and clearly,
                           and without fear
                           of being misunderstood. I once complained to her of something said by some one else.
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2541">"I do not
                              care what any one thinks of me, or chooses to say of me"
                           </said>â€”I can almost hear her speak;
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2545">"nay, more than that, I do not care what any one chooses to say of the people I love;
                              it
                              does not in any way affect the truth. People are at liberty to speak what they choose,
                              and I am
                              also at liberty not to care one farthing for what they say nor for any mistakes that
                              they
                              make."
                           </said> What Mrs. Kemble did care for, scrupulously, with infinite solicitude, was the
                           fear of having ever caused pain by anything that she had said in the energy of the
                           moment; she would
                           remember it and think over it after days had passed. People did not always understand
                           her, nor how
                           her love of the truth, as it appeared to her, did not prevent her tenderness for the
                           individual; she
                           would also take it for granted that whoever it was she was talking to also preferred
                           the truth to
                           any adaptation of it. Her stories of the past were endlessly interesting and various.
                           She had known
                           everybody of interest. She had always detested banalities, preferring silence to commonplace.
                           Even
                           as a girl she seems to have gone to the root of things, and made others speak from
                           their hearts. Her
                           pathetic <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="203" data-tei-n="197"> </a></span> story of Mary Shelley haunts one with the saddest
                           persistence, and seems to sigh back the cur- tain of the past. 
                           <said id="d74890e2550">"Bring up a boy to think for
                              himself,"
                           </said> she as a girl once said to Mrs. Shelley; and to this came the mother's
                           passionate reply, 
                           <said id="d74890e2553">"Ah! no, no; bring him up to think like other people."</said>

                        <p id="d74890e2556">Mr. Henry James instances among her social gifts her extraordinary power of calling
                           up the
                           representation of that which was in her mind, and impressing others with her own impression.
                           Those,
                           he says, who sometimes went with her to the play in the last years of her life will
                           remember the
                           Juliets, the Beatrices, the Rosalinds, whom she could still make vivid without any
                           accessory except
                           the surrounding London uproar.

                        <p id="d74890e2559">I myself fortunately once happened to ask her some question concerning "As You Like
                           It,"which had
                           been her sister's favorite play. Suddenly, as if by a miracle, her little room seemed
                           transformed;
                           there were the actors, not even actors; there stood Rosalind and Celia themselves,
                           there stood the
                           Duke, there was Orlando in the life and spirit. One spoke and then another, Rosalind
                           pleading, the
                           stern Duke unrelenting; then we were somehow carried to the Forest, with its depths
                           and its
                           delightful company. It all lasted but a few moments, and there was Mrs. Kemble again
                           sitting in her
                           chair in her usual corner; and yet I cannot to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="198"> </a></span> this day realize
                           that the whole beautiful mirage did not sweep through the little room, with color
                           and light and
                           emotion, and the rustling of trees, and the glittering of embroidered draperies.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2564">Mrs. Kemble told me that she herself had only once heard her aunt Mrs. Siddons read.
                           She said the
                           impression was very overpowering, though she had been almost a child at the time.
                           It was from the
                           witches' scene in "Macbeth" that Mrs. Siddons read. She was very old and broken at
                           the time, and
                           living in retirement; but she forgot her suffering state in her theme. The sense of
                           storm and
                           mystery and power was all round about, Mrs. Kemble said. One can imagine the scene,
                           the dark-eyed
                           maiden sitting at the feet of the great actress and receiving the initiation from
                           her failing
                           hands.

                        <p id="d74890e2568">The true dramatic faculty does not indeed depend on footlights, or on a stage; it
                           is a special gift
                           from spirit to spirit. Fanny Kemble was almost the very last representative of the
                           ruling race to
                           which she belonged, and in no small degree did she retain to the very end their noble
                           gift of
                           illumination, of giving life to words and feelings. She herself has defined this power.
                           "<q style=" display: inline; ">Things
                              dramatic and things theatrical are often confounded together"</q> she writes. <q style=" display: inline; ">"English
                              people, being for the most part neither one nor the other, speak as if they were identical,
                              instead of so dissimilar that they <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="205" data-tei-n="199"> </a></span> are nearly opposite. That
                              which is dramatic in human nature is the passionate, emotional, humorous element,
                              the simplest
                              portion of our composition; that which imitates it is its theatrical reproduction.
                              The dramatic
                              is the real of which the theatrical is the false. A combination of the power,"</q> she
                           continues, <q style=" display: inline; ">"of representing passion and emotion with that of imagining or conceiving it is
                              essential to make a good actor; their combination in the highest degree alone makes
                              a great
                              one."</q></p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2581">I remember Mrs. Sartoris once saying: 
                           <said id="d74890e2583">"I do not know if you will think it very conceited of me;
                              but it always seems to me that no one I ever talk to seems able to say anything clearly
                              and to
                              the point, except myself and my sister Fanny. When she speaks I know exactly what
                              she means and
                              wants to say; when other people speak, I have to find out what they mean, and even
                              then I am not
                              certain that they know it themselves."
                           </said> As Mrs. Sartoris spoke sheâ€”looked at me with her
                           searching glance; her beautiful head was like that of some classical statue nobly
                           set upon her
                           shoulders. But no classical statue ever looked at you as she did; her eyes and mouth
                           spoke before
                           she uttered. She always seemed to me an improvisatrice. Both these women had the rare
                           power of
                           stirring and stimulating one's sleepy makeshift soul, suggesting, satisfying. It was
                           as if Mrs.
                           Sartoris could at will compel the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="206" data-tei-n="200"> </a></span> sound and the sense and the
                           color into that in which she was interested, so that we were all for the time, and
                           indeed for a
                           lifetime since, illumined by her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2589">Mrs. Sartoris was living in Paris in the Rue Royale, at one time, in a very stately
                           apartment. It
                           seemed to suit her, as did all handsome and beautiful things. I don't suppose the
                           modern aesthetic
                           taste would have suited her. She liked glorious things full of color, Italian, sumptuous,
                           and she
                           liked them used for daily life and pleasure. She made a home out of her lovely bric-Ã -brac
                           and
                           tapestries and cabinets. Something, of course, must be allowed for the grateful excitement
                           of
                           inexperience; but to us in those days her houses seemed like succeeding paradises
                           upon earth. I can
                           remember on one occasion gazing in admiration at a glowing shaded lamp, the first
                           I had ever seen,
                           reflected from one glass to another, and listening to my hostess as she sang Oberon's
                           "Mermaid
                           Song," from the far end of the room. Then came dinner in an octagon dining-room at
                           a round table
                           with pink wax candles and ices, and then a quick drive to the theatre where our stalls
                           were kept for
                           us. I remember neither the name of the theatre nor of the play, only the look of the
                           bright lighted
                           stage, and the pretty white house full of spectators. Mrs. Sartoris was using a pair
                           of turquoise
                           eye-glasses <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="207" data-tei-n="201"> </a></span> through which she looked about, and presently she
                           whispered to me, 
                           <said id="d74890e2593">"There, to your left, in the box on the first tier."</said> I looked,
                           expecting I know not what, and my first impression was disappointment. I saw some
                           figures in the
                           boxâ€”two men standing at the back, and a lady in a front seat sitting alone. She was
                           a stout
                           middle-aged woman, dressed in a stiff watered-silk dress, with a huge cameo, such
                           as people then
                           wore, at her throat. Her black shiny hair shone like polished ebony; she had a heavy
                           red face,
                           marked brows, great dark eyes; there was something-how shall I say it?â€”rather fierce,
                           defiant, and
                           set in her appearance, powerful, sulky; she frightened one a little.

                           her eyeglasses. The figure also bent its head, but I don't remember any smile or change
                           of that
                           fixed expression. The contrast struck me the more, for my hostess, as I have said,
                           scarcely needed
                           to speak to make herself understood; her whole countenance spoke for her even if she
                           was silent.
                           George Sand looked half-bored, half-far-away; she neither lighted up nor awoke into

                        <p id="d74890e2615">Mrs. Kemble once said she had heard George Sand described half in fun as 
                           <said id="d74890e2617">"unamiable, very
                              emphatic, very dictatorialâ€”very like herself, in short "
                           </said>; but perhaps the description was
                           as superficial in one case as it assuredly would have been in the other.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2621">Mrs. Kemble was dramatic rather than dictatorial. Her selection of facts was curiously
                           partial and
                           even biassed; not so her uncompromising sense of their moral value. When she sat with
                           her watch open
                           before her, reading, writing, working to rule, it was because time itself was of importance,
                           in her
                           eyes, rather than her work. For her, life belonged to time, rather than time to life.
                           
                           <said id="d74890e2623">"Do you
                              think I could have borne with my life if I had not lived by rule," 
                           </said>she used to say. She
                           carried her love of method into everything, even into the game of patience with which
                           she amused
                           herself. Evening after evening the table would be set and the appointed number of
                           games would be
                           played conscientiously, as she sat, whether she was tired or not, inclined or not,
                           as a beloved
                           enchantress dealing out past destinies to the pasteboard men and women on the table
                           before her. Mrs.
                           Kemble once

                           might moralize over the combinationâ€”Mrs. Kemble teaching patience in her grand-seigneur
                           fashion, and
                           meekly subservient to its laws! It was indeed because she was so conscious of passionate
                           interests
                           and diversities that she tried to shape her life to one recurring pattern. A friend
                           recalls an
                           anecdote of Frederika Bremer, who was not willing to see Mrs. Kemble on one occasion,
                           explaining
                           afterwards, 
                           <said id="d74890e2632">"I could not see so many people as you are when I had a headache."</said> She was
                           indeed many peopleâ€”actors and musicians, philosophers, teachers, and poetsâ€”in one.
                           She was eighty
                           before she attempted a novel, but her letters are models, especially the earlier ones.
                           Her poems are
                           very lovely. Her farewell to the Alps was written after threescore years and ten had
                           passed over her
                           head, and I heard her read it with tears. Once I asked her why she so disliked the
                           stage, loving all
                           that belonged to it as she did. She said that it was because she loved her own being
                           even more than
                           her art; that she found the constant stimulation of emotion in time destroyed in herself
                           the
                           possibility of natural feeling, and that she wished to keep the possession of her
                           own soul; but I
                           think she has also written this somewhere in her Records.

                        <p id="d74890e2636">Perhaps the most distinguishing stamp of her character was her great and fervent piety.
                           Her <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="210" data-tei-n="204"> </a></span> convictions were very deep; what she said of her own religious
                           faith was that it was <q style=" display: inline; ">"invincible, unreasoning." </q> I have heard a friend describe how, as they
                           came along the mountain-pass from Roselaui, Mrs. Kemble made her bearers set her down
                           at the summit
                           of the ascent.<q style=" display: inline; "> "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,"</q> she said, breaking out into the
                           words of the psalm, and repeating verse after verse. She used to go regularly to church
                           when she was
                           in London, though I do not think any of the steeples and pulpits which adorn South
                           Kensington
                           exactly suited the deep and fervent spirit of her faith. She was neither high church
                           nor low church
                           nor broad church, and once after witnessing a Catholic ceremony, the 
                           <foreign id="d74890e2646" style="font-style: italic;" xml:lang="fr">FÃªte Dieu</foreign>, in some foreign city, she exclaimed to her man-servant, <q style=" display: inline; ">"Oh, Govert,
                              what an amusing religion you have!"</q> But her faith was a noble one, and her great reverence
                           for what was good and great seemed to make goodness and greatness nearer to us.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d74890e2653">Of all possessions, that of the added power which comes to us through the gifts of
                           bthers is one of
                           the most mysterious and most precious. We are in- adequate in a thousand ways, but
                           the grace is
                           there; we are disappointed and inefficient, and yet we can be happy in a perfection
                           which may be
                           revealed at any moment, in the twinkling of an eye. It is like some secret link binding

                           qualities greater than they are conscious of in themselves, was, I think, the virtue
