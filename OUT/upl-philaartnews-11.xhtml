                           are: Delaware County Camera Club; Frankford Camera Club; Glenwood Camera Club; KYW
                           Camera Club; Lantern and Lens Guild of Women Photographers; Miniature Camera Club
                           of Philadelphia; Photographic Guild of Philadelphia; Photographic Group of Philadelphia;

                           Director, Charles Heller, and Henry F. Plate. One hundred and sixty-nine photos were
                           selected, and if these prints represent a general cross-section of the work of the
                           members of the Council of Camera Clubs, their standard of perfection is professionally
                           very high. It is perhaps the best photographic exhibit we have seen this season, because
                           of the wide human interest of the subjects and their extraordinary diversity.

                           late last year for the purpose of bringing together organizations of a like purpose,
                           and to further a better understanding among these clubs. This Exhibition is one of
                           the outstanding functions of the Council.”

                        <p id="d57013e231">In the PHILADELPHIA ART NEWS as in many other publications it has been reported that
                           Lawrence Tibbett was national chairman of the Federal Arts Committee, which is campaigning
                           in favor of the Coffee-Pepper Bill. This, according to a recent letter by Mr. Tibbett
                           to the New York Times, was a serious error. He specifically denies any affiliation
                           with the organization, likewise stating his disapproval of the Coffee-Pepper Bill
                           which the Committee is supporting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e234">Mr. Tibbett writes: “While I am in favor of its avowed purpose, viz.: the creation
                           of a Federal Bureau of the Fine Arts, nevertheless it is my individual opinion that
                           this bill will not accomplish its objective in the best manner possible.”

                        <p id="d57013e243">Stage Models, in their Annual Exhibition, again occupy two second-floor galleries
                           at the Art Alliance. The show was in the nature of a contest, judged by Donald Oenslager,
                           Harry Wagstaff Gribble, and Lee Simonson, and six of the seven awards were won by
                           local participants.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e246">There were two groups in the competition, the first for models of produced plays or
                           operas, the second for ballet. In Group I the first prize ($50) was captured by Rita
                           Newhold Oliver’s setting for “Ception Shoals,” which showed a convincing lighthouse
                           interior. Eugene Morley won second award ($25) with his imaginative setting for Scene
                           IV of Toller’s “Masses and Man.” Third prize ($15) went to W. Craig Smith. His setting
                           for “R.U.R.,” Act I, shows the roaring factory of Rossum’s Universal Robots through
                           panes of glass in a huge office window which comprises the entire backstage.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e249">Honorable mentions in this group were given to Barbara Saul for her prison scene set
                           in “The Hairy Ape,” to Joseph W. Oliver for “Will o’ the Wisp,” and to Gale Carter
                           Morningstar for a “Twelfth Night” set with revolving stage. Miss Saul’s set presents,
                           with a simple crossing of lines, a cell block that makes an effective stage picture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e252">The twenty-five dollar prize for a ballet set went to Samuel S. Castner’s design for
                           Respighi’s ballet, “La Boutique Fantastique.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e256">Many other delightful models are included in the show. One would like to see “Carmen”
                           played in the fine setting created for it by Sidney Laverson. There is enough room
                           for the sweep of action of the opera, yet the solidity of the buildings, which make
                           a picturesque background, is suggested very well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e259">Louise Mudry’s “Hamlet” presents an ornate stage, with Hamlet placed as few stars
                           would consent to be placed, where he will be unseen by the audience on the sides.
                           However, the set itself is interestingly designed.

                        <p id="d57013e278">The Philadelphia Flower Show may well be considered one of the leading art events
                           of the season. Acclaimed as the finest show of its kind in the country, it attracts
                           visitors from many states, and its appeal is not alone horticultural. Architecture,
                           landscape design, interior decoration, sculpture, and display are well represented.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e281">One of the main reasons for the superiority of the Philadelphia Show is its design
                           as an artistic whole. This year Walter Hengel was again the architect. His scheme
                           provided, in the center of the hall, a thirty foot circular hemlock hedge in which
                           twelve arches were cut. Along the four main axes were large rectangular basins featuring
                           sculpture by Harriet Frishmuth. Bronze figures by Malvina Hoffman, A. A. Weinman,
                           and Miss Frishmuth relieved the austerity of the inner circle and appeared to advantage
                           against the dark green of the hemlock. In the main aisle, leading to the circle, the
                           famous Widener acacias were effectively placed. Stately elegance and old-world formality
                           characterized the entire design.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e284">Mr. Hengel was also responsible for a prize winning outdoor lounge in the Spanish-Moorish
                           manner. With a wrought iron gate, a mosaic fountain and planting against a pink plaster
                           wall, it suggested an ideal patio.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e287">Closer to home were the Back Yard Gardens contributed by garden clubs and offering
                           ingenious methods for the improvement of city dwellings.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e291">Mantel Decorations featuring flower arrangement in a pair of vases provided some interesting
                           notes in interior decoration. Old fashioned arrangements under glass were revived
                           to adorn parlor tables in the Victorian manner. There was a conspicuous absence of
                           modernistic arrangements.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e294">It is unfortunate that, in a show with such a high artistic level in general, a few
                           individual exhibits consistently sacrifice good taste to a garish and crowded display
                           of what is most showy in their stock in trade. The florists’ exhibits were, on the
                           whole, quite disappointing this year. With such a glorious opportunity for tasteful
                           display, why did they find it necessary to introduce plush Easter bunnies, revolving
                           brides, and ornate crockery? More florists might follow the example of The Orchid
                           Shop, which joined forces with Sanford Kean, interior decorator, in creating its display.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e297">Yet, aside from introducing every year a bigger and better marigold, the Flower Show
                           continues to improve annually as a medium for aesthetic expression.
                        </p>

                           exhibition of works by and material relating to this worldfamed American naturalist.
                           Bringing together a quantity of material from museums, galleries, and private collections
                           throughout the country, the exhibition will also mark the one hundredth anniversary

                        <p id="d57013e338">Doubtless many artists would be surprised if told that they were lacking in cooperation
                           with their gallery. Such, however, is quite frequently the case, although the artist
                           himself may not be aware of it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e341">As an excellent instance of this, we may cite an attitude popular among artists: disdain
                           for the “commercial” process of selling their pictures. Many of them feel that a price
                           placed upon a picture either sullies its purity as a work of art or is an unnecessary
                           appendage. Neither of which, of course, is the case. To sell a picture is honorable—and
                           frequently a necessity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e345">When a painting is completed to the satisfaction of the artist, it is his duty, if
                           he intends to sell it, to establish a reasonable price. When established, that price
                           should remain, rather than float about in mid-air, ready to go up or down at a moment’s
                           notice. Furthermore, the painting should never be a gift—the artist must realize that
                           every work given away makes the next harder to sell.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e348">The artist, likewise, should operate on a well balanced basis in relation to the gallery
                           exhibiting his work—there should be no dickering or selling over the head of his gallery.
                           Also, the value he places upon his work should be neither too much nor too little.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e351">To illustrate these points:</p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e354">A patron enters a gallery and admires a particular canvas, costing five hundred dollars.
                           This is “really too much” for her to pay, and couldn’t the gallery get in touch with
                           the artist and find how little he would take for it (incidentally, a bona fide occurrence).
                           The gallery reluctantly phones the artist and, after much hemming and hawing, he says:
                           “Four hundred fifty, and not a cent less.” A less useful attitude we wot not of.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e357">Again: a patron enters a gallery, admires a painting, inquires not only the price
                           asked for it but the address of the painter, and after the exhibition closes, buys
                           it directly from its creator minus the gallery’s commission.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e360">Another instance: Mr. So-and-so saw, in a gallery, a picture by an artist he knew
                           and was by no means hesitant in telling the attendant that there was no sense in his
                           buying the picture, for after the exhibition the artist would in all likelihood give
                           it to him.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e364">We were, on one occasion, talking to a young artist about his former teacher—who is
                           well known. After extolling the merits of his teacher he added: “And if you admire
                           his work he’ll give it to you.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e367">We have known of more than one artist who was too “bashful” to place even a reasonable
                           price upon his work and, on the other hand, many who charged too much for practical
                           purposes. We recently examined a small, but excellent, still life by one of Philadelphia’s
                           most promising young artists. Curiosity tempted us to ask the price, and, all things
                           considered, it was quite staggering.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e370">We once knew of a young artist of definite ability, who spent his days in a factory
                           earning fifteen dollars per week. A collector offered him three times that amount
                           for a moderately sized water color, which he refused. He wanted ninety dollars or
                           nothing!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e373">The foregoing instances indicate principally a lack of proper balance between the
                           artist, his work and the gallery. Until such problems are intelligently ironed out
                           neither artist nor gallery shall thrive.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e376">“The Ten” (despite the fact that only nine are represented) are holding their annual
                           exhibition of painting and sculpture currently at the Art Club. All contributors are
                           women well known locally and for a number of years these showings have offered a variety
                           of stimulating works.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e379">This exhibition is fresh and joyous, and characterized by purity of vision and cleanliness
                           of accomplishment. Only one of the exhibitors seems notably interested in the life
                           of man—that is S. Gertrude Schell. Employing an extremely rich, yet sombre, palette,
                           this painter is particularly concerned with the drama of life and those who labor
                           to live.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e383">“Day’s End”, for instance, is a perfectly fine piece of painting—compositionally,
                           the most has been made of a fishing coast, in which tired fishermen plod upward over
                           the rocks, while far beneath we see the coast dotted with small but colorful fishing
                           craft. Similar quality is to be found in “Men”, a study of fisherfolk with their boats
                           and nets, and, as an eloquent background, stark mountains and the sea. Other notable
                           canvases of this artist are “Summer Clouds”, “Carnival” and “Winding Road”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e386">In contrast, Isabel Branson Cartwright has an outlook of complete joyousness, as witness
                           “Cortina d’Ampezzo”—a tiny village clustered among trees, mountains and clouds. Likewise,
                           the artist has obviously been very happy in “A Garden in Maine” and with “Summer Flowers”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e389">For sheer vigor of treatment we recommend Constance Cochrane. Not only are “Sunrise”
                           and “Shattering Sea” of extraordinary technical energy—“Fog and Spray” boasts, by
                           all odds, the greatest verve in the show. Miss Cochrane’s palette coordinates well
                           with her technique.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e392">The canvases of Nancy Maybin Ferguson have been commented upon previously by the writer—they
                           retain their freshness and modernity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e395">All except two of the eight oils by Sue May Gill are portraits. All—and notably “Sylvia
                           and Terry”—are accomplished with crisp breadth of brush stroke and opalescent color.
                           “Estelle Dennis in Modern Dance” is a large canvas built upon a clever triangular
                           compositional principle.

                        <p id="d57013e398">One definition amply characterizes the work of Lucile Howard; a tasteful and carefully
                           controlled palette together with a sense of soft, poetic plastic values. “Gateway
                           to the Acropolis: Athens”, “Monemvasia: Greece”, “Thera on Santorin: the Cyclades,
                           Aegean Sea”, “The Mountains of Crete: Sea of Candia” and “Corfu, from the Ex-Kaiser’s
                           Palace” testify to the delicacy of this painter’s vision.

                        <p id="d57013e402">The art of Emma Fordyce MacRae is one of flat patterns of grayed color, with which
                           is incorporated a deft sense of composition more vital and expressive than one may
                           at first comprehend. This is notable in such oils as “Pidgeon Cove” and “Fishermen’s
                           Houses”. The same aesthetic principle applied to portraiture may be found in “The
                           Open Book” and “Melina in Green”.

                        <p id="d57013e405">We now come to the colorful decoration of M. Elizabeth Price. This artist achieves
                           her zenith of decoration in “The Poppy and the Rose”, “My Own Poppy” and “Favorites
                           of September”. A screen: “Magnolias”, is a happy combination of the painter and decorator.
                           It should be effective—in a large room. “Sketch—Santa Maria Novella” is, as it implies,
                           a sketch: and strangely (or not), the most vital contribution of the painter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e408">The sculpture is contributed by Mary Lawser. Decorative plaques, such as “Alice in
                           Wonderland” and “The Lady and the Cat” are charming and imaginative—particularly the
                           former, which resembles a delicious cookie. The sculptures also shows “Tora”, a stylized
                           portrait bust.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e411">Mary-Russell Ferrell Colton, who is not represented, is the tenth of “The Ten”.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e414">The wood engravings of Lynd Ward, now to be seen at the Carlen Galleries, are considerably
                           more than stimulating. Their inherent vitality is principally a matter of dynamic
                           design—Ward seems to have the happy faculty of hitting promptly upon the basic compositional
                           motive of his subject, and he is fearless in his use of it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e417">Coupled with this we find an amazing mastery of technical problems. Ward’s sense of
                           line and mass is served admirably by his ability to create the finest of lines and
                           most luminous of black masses. His use of the tint tool is of the utmost finesse—he
                           is an artist-craftsman.

                              painters who have had the tremendous growth that Hugh Breckenridge experienced. In
                              the Memorial Exhibition of his work at the Art Alliance, one can trace the artistic
                              curve of a great painter, who evolved from an academic, if original, recorder to a
                              completely free and creative artist in pure color and movement.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e429">A certain group of canvases in this exhibit, among them “Apple Tree”, “Hillside, Autumn”,
                              and “Bowl of Fruit” would seem to represent Breckenridge’s early stage—a stage at
                              which representational values were still dominant. And yet, in “Bowl of Fruit”, a
                              still life of a coffee pot and dish of apples on a white cloth, there is a suggestion
                              that representational values were not enough. These apples are not just apples. They
                              have been so simplified and then so solidly painted that they are symbolic of abstract
                              order. One finds in the architectural quality of this painting more than a superficial
                              resemblance to the early still lifes of Cezanne, who, like Breckenridge, strove to
                              express basic, rather than merely surface, patterns.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e432">“Little Harbor” might stand as representative of the transitional period of his painting.
                              Pure abstraction has not yet been reached, but in this composition of land and sea
                              and boat, concrete representation has been reduced to a minimum. The landscape which
                              he painted is a series of planes and colors organically related in space. It is on
                              the borderline of abstraction. With “Flower Expression”, “Fairy Grotto”, “Sky Drama”,
                              the borderline is crossed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e435">Here are highly imaginative color compositions through which Breckenridge recreated
                              emotion and sensation. “Kaleidoscope”, with its flowing areas of clear and prismatic
                              color resolved into complex designs, seems to symbolize this last stage of his work.
                              Even the title suggests the nature of his painting—the seemingly casual pattern shaken
                              in a kaleidoscope. But even as in the mechanical device, the pattern is not formed
                              by chance but by a necessity of process, so in the painting we see an organization
                              created through some inner compulsion.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e439">Looking at these last color abstractions of Hugh Breckenridge, we feel that he saw
                              the world in color alone, color for him being the substance of which all things are
                              made. His paintings reflect that vision with strength and beauty.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e442">The contribution which the abstractionist movement has made to modern art is fully
                              illustrated in the Art Alliance exhibit of abstract prints by French and American
                              printmakers. From the work of the Cubists, the stripping away of subject and association
                              to achieve the bare bones of form and design—exemplified here in Picasso’s numerous
                              “Compositions,” studies in decorative volumes, or in the familiar grey, green, and
                              brown still lifes of Braque, experiments in the delicate balancing of line and mass—there
                              has resulted a new appreciation of decorative values, an appreciation which many American
                              artists have used to advantage.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e445">Although essentially decorative in nature, many of the prints in this exhibition are
                              yet not devoid of meaning. The varying simplification, elaboration, or distortion
                              of forms and the repatterning of these forms have frequently involved the expression
                              of idea as well as of the decorative impulse.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e448">Hobson Pittman, in the wood cut “Woodstock,” has used the angles of houses and churches
                              to create not only a bold composition of blacks and whites but also a symbol of the
                              austere New England spirit. The steeples of the clapboard churches through meaningful
                              as well as decorative distortion, have become the Fingers of God, raised in warning.
                              Weldon Bailey’s lithograph, “Greek Fantasy,” a compact massing of antique motifs—a
                              pure female profile, the horn of plenty, the head of a youth, the lyre, and the shallow
                              cylix—recalls the symmetry and grace of Greece in the nature of the material and of
                              the design. This is not pure abstraction, but the simplification inherent in the abstract
                              movement has done much to increase its decorative quality.

                              lend itself to generalities. Too many points of view, too many variant uses of the
                              medium are illustrated to permit any all-inclusive characterization.

                              rhythmic contrast in deep blacks and whites on a black surface. Women, conceived in
                              terms of volume rather than merely surface areas, bend and rise in ample space, and
                              are linked together by repetition of curved sheaves of rice. It is a striking, and
                              strongly designed print.

                           <p id="d57013e458">Four Honorable Mentions were awarded: to I. J. Sanger for a careful and finely cut
                              landscape; to Oscar Weissbuck for “Fields of Spring,” in which the undulating track
                              of the plough serves as a unifying motif; to Todros Geller for “South of Chicago,”
                              a pattern of the industrial scene in which blocks of building, chimneys and stylized
                              spirals of smoke are focussed in two bent workman; and to Jacobi for “3 Men.” “3 Men,”
                              a strong characterization of three heads in deep shadow, achieves remarkable unity
                              of form and idea. The rough, decisive line in which the block has been cut emphasizes
                              the cynical despair of the three faces.

                              of contemporary modes. All the “isms” are represented—from abstractionism to the latest
                              version of romanticism—and all types of techniques are illustrated.

                              lithographs, forming vigorous and telling designs. In “Man with Satchel,” an interesting
                              composition is gained by the reiteration of the exaggerated curve of the walker’s
                              legs in the curve of the hill that is the background. The illustrations for “Lysistrata,”
                              done with a simple, but sophisticated line, reveal Picasso as a skilled draughtsman.
                              The American scene trend is reflected in Grant Wood’s lithograph “Tree Planting Group,”
                              while the familiar humour of Wanda Gag is seen in the cat study “Hors d’Oeuvre.”

                              three landscapes are outstanding. “Autumn,” a seven stencil print, is a highly successful
                              arrangement of large, flat areas in autumn greens, browns, and blues.

                           <p id="d57013e470">The oils, pastels, and water colors by Nicola D’Ascenzo, on view at the Philomusian
                              Club, are disconcerting. To one who has known only the bold design and vibrant color
                              of his work in stained glass, these other examples of Mr. D’Ascenzo’s art seem peculiarly
                              pallid. With the exception of the rich melon still lifes and the figure piece in which
                              two seated girls bulk in the foreground against an Italian hill city, most of this
                              painting gives an impression of unreasonable restraint. When one turns from the imaginative
                              color and imagery of the stained glass panel depicting Wotan’s Farewell to the flat
                              passivity of the landscapes which constitute the major part of this exhibition, one
                              is surprised—and disappointed.

                           <p id="d57013e473">Also on view at the Philomusian Club is a group of pastels, water colors, and scissor-paintings
                              by Carol Doriss Chapman. The pastel medium seems particularly successful in “Old Swedes’
                              Church,” in which the blurred, blue-grey tones of the chalk suggest the quiet and
                              grace of the old church. In spite of a certain preciseness, the two miniature water
                              colors, “Peach Blossoms” and “Apple Blossoms,” have a pleasingly decorative arrangement
                              and color design.

                           by 20,000 people, caused such heated comment between the Academicians, who criticized
                           the artist severely, and the modernists who defended him, that one art critic who
                           took part in the controversy was forced to resign his job. Photographs of the incident
                           were recently featured by “Life.” Sir John Langstaff proposed the idea of taking up
                           a subscription to purchase one of the paintings, and “Art on the Beach” was chosen
                           and duly presented to the National Gallery of Melbourne.

                        <p id="d57013e1101">This relationship is beautifully exemplified in the Living Room of the home of Wm.
                           S. Wasserman designed by George Howe. Being the work of George Howe, you will quite
                           naturally know that it is about as contemporary as any of our present architecture.
                           The interior of this house is exquisite in spatial and tonal verities. The Living
                           Room is particularly beautiful with its ebonized wood treatment. With a sureness of
                           taste, fine old Chinese painting and sculpture is selected as decoration. Thousands
                           of years span between this ancient art of China and today. And yet here they are side
                           by side carrying the torch of true art form.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1104">There are many periods of Art of the past that bear the same beautiful relationship
                           to our modern expression. In fact I truly believe that really great Art of any age
                           whatever has a definite place in the house of today if used with taste and discrimination.
                           The very simplicity of contemporary treatments bring out the subtle beauty of these
                           art forms as never before when they were placed in florid and disturbing surroundings.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1107">Many people would like to live in the modern home that adapts itself so beautifully
                           to the sociological trend of present day living, but they do not want to give up these
                           treasures that have become so much a part of their cultural life. They have been led
                           to believe that all this must be relegated to the ash heap while an entirely new group
                           of contemporary painting and sculpture and crafts is substituted. Since they refuse
                           to make this sacrifice (and more power to them), they continue to live uncomfortably
                           and out of step. This is not at all necessary.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1110">If it is true that the great Art of the past has no relationship with the Art of today,
                           as exemplified in our modern home, then the Art of today is not Great. We must assume
                           that it is merely a “flash in the pan” and will not survive. This I refuse to believe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1114">Much that is being done will not pass this test with the great Art of the past. But
                           there is also much that will—much that is created by really great artist builders.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1117">The same thing applies from a decorative standpoint to fine period furniture. There
                           is this exception. Furniture is fundamentally not entirely decorative; it must be
                           functional. The design of furniture is governed by the clothes we wear, by the way
                           we sit and stand, by our contemporary habits of life. It is difficult to find a parallel
                           in the past. We can not be comfortable today in the same chair in which the tightly
                           corseted and much bustled lady of the past sat so stiffly. Furniture is definitely
                           a contemporary expression of human needs. That is the reason so much has been incorporated
                           in the building. It is not because of decorative inconsistency but rather from functional

                           increased phenomenally during the past few years, both in transportation and equipment.
                           City artists used to carry bulky and awkward stuff from the end of the car line to
                           the nearest copse. Now they put their strong, compact, and light easels and boxes
                           in their cars and wander far afield to whatever interests them most. Good easels to
                           be had from $1.39 to $10. The larger kinds will hold canvases up to 35x40. There’s
                           a one-legged easel which is ideal for small sketches. The Arco Watercolor Easel ($8.)
                           permits the artist to work flat, but can be converted into an oil easel at will.

                           Schools are usually very limiting as to time allotment. So the problem confronting
                           a creative teacher of Art, who refuses to rely on the old imitative methods, is one
                           of prime importance both to himself or herself and the child.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1210">As the development of the child through the power of his own activity is the main
                           objective of progressive art teaching, “skill,” which is the average adult’s appraisal
                           of what constitutes “good” art, accordingly becomes of secondary consideration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1214">The child learns to draw as he creates his own images, and not through those implanted
                           by a supervising mind. How to release these stored up images from visual memories
                           and actual experiences of his own, constitutes the creative teacher’s greatest opportunity
                           for vital work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1217">“What we have to do as teachers is to bring to the child something akin to what can
                           flow out of its very own self, out of the actions of its arms and fingers,” says Steiner.
                           Free rhythmic work, with swinging strokes of the arms on large paper, at walls and
                           big tables, using any free medium such as soft chalk (used broadside) or finger painting
                           to music, is advisable, as it releases these plastic, flowing, formative, forces of
                           the child and stirs the creative imagination. Thus, through the constructive play
                           of the faculty of invention, the subjective nature of the child is projected or objectified,
                           integrating the child’s physical, emotional and mental natures.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1220">Best Maugard says—“In training a child the first step is to free him from timidity
                           by means of a flexible craftsmanship, in order that the expansion of his ideas may
                           be encouraged by perfect command of method. On this foundation he builds up his own
                           style, his inner point of view and evolves his own experience into an individual capable
                           of finding his own material and making the fullest use of it.”

                        <p id="d57013e1345">A camera contest of a different kind was that recently sponsored by the management
                           of the office building at 1616 Walnut St. All camera enthusiasts, working in the building,
                           whether millionaires or elevator operators, submitted outstanding prints which were
                           then put on exhibition in the lobby. Among the prize-winners were Joseph C. Morris,
                           banker, who took first prize in the Pictorial Group with “The Commodore’s Aboard”;
                           William Rhawn, insurance agent, first prize in the Candid Camera Group, with “Framed”;
                           and William Connor, elevator operator, who was awarded $10.00 for the best photograph
                           of the building. Since there is no point of vantage from which a picture showing the
                           full height can be taken, Connor shows 1616 Walnut St. as reflected in an automobile

                           <p id="d57013e1372">From far off somewhere way below decks I glimpsed the fleeting reflection of flashlights
                              momentarily stabbing the darkness. I realized what that meant. The rescued crew were
                              being photographed on the third-class deck. As I stumbled down the companionways I
                              felt for my flash powder (modern flash bulbs were not yet invented) and found to my
                              dismay that the bottle of magnesium had become broken sometime during the mad scramble
                              to get aboard. I knew, of course, that I could photograph the rescued crew at my leisure
                              the next morning en route to Southampton, but I wanted pictures to send off that night
                              for the two slow boats. I reached the scene of action in almost total darkness. They
                              had finished getting their pictures and I heard the click of folding tripods.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1375">“Pull a flash for me, will you?” I demanded.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1378">“Who are you?” someone shouted.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1382">I called my name as I reached the deck.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1385">“Okay, Charlie, set up.” It was Ray Rousseau of the Pacific and Atlantic Photos. I
                              set up my camera. A few impotent deck lamps only accentuated the gloom of the midnight-steeped
                              scene. It was so dark I had to guess at my focus.

                           <p id="d57013e1394">Wham . . . the flashlight went off, illuminating briefly the rescued crew lined up,
                              their nude torsos gleaming momentarily in front of a back-drop of passengers watching
                              the show.

                           <p id="d57013e1401">“No, I wasn’t ready,” I answered. I had it in the bag all right, but I had to get
                              two more, one for each of the slow boats and one for the fast boat from Cherbourg.
                              Covering every possible point of transportation.

                           <p id="d57013e1407">Boom! That made two, but still I wanted one more.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1410">“Okay Chas?” called Ray.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1413">“No. Didn’t have time to pull my slide.” I lied. I was losing prestige and I knew
                              it but it had to be done.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1416">“Just pull one more, Ray,” I begged.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1420">“Thought you were a one-plate man,” gibed Ray. “All right, are you set now?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1423">“Yes.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1426">“Sure?”</p>

                           <p id="d57013e1432">Pouff . . . the flash went off and I had my three pictures.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1435">“Thanks, Ray. I got it,” I shouted.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1439">“Don’t mention it,” came the good-natured answer.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1442">I shoved my holders into my pocket and turned to leave the deck when through the spray
                              and darkness I heard a voice call “Charlie!” and a young woman detached herself from
                              the black mass of watching passengers. I peered through the darkness and recognized
                              her as she came close to me. It was the girl friend whom I had not seen for two years
                              and thought was still in America. She was coming over for a surprise visit, and lo
                              and behold, I had come all the way from Belgium to France to England to Ireland and
                              met up with my wife on the Irish Sea. She had heard me shout my name as I came on
                              deck but knew the game and did not call until I got my pictures. Wonder if I’d been
                              able to shoot them if I’d found her there first? Probably . . . nothing surprises
                              a cameraman.

                           <p id="d57013e1445">The all-ashore whistle of the lighter sounded eerily, and hastily wrapping two sets
                              of pictures and plate holders I gave them to my Irish messenger and he went back to
                              Cobh to place them aboard the two boats next morning. It turned out that they had
                              a good crossing and reached the New York office in splendid time. I sent the third
                              set off from Cherbourg and, heading for Paris, went apartment hunting, as my bachelor
                              quarters were not large enough for two.

                           <p id="d57013e1448">News photography does have it’s comic as well as it’s tragic side. When Kathryn Edson,
                              the American dancer, was charming audiences at a theatre on the Champs Elysées with
                              her Hopi Indian interpretations I made arrangements to photograph her, and chose the
                              woods as a natural setting for the picture. So we chartered a taxi and drove to the
                              Bois de Boulogne and headed into the forest. Picking a nice quiet lonely spot I waited,
                              with my camera all ready on a little pathway, while Miss Edson disappeared behind
                              some trees to get into her costume, which consisted mostly of a few beads. Just then
                              one of the local gendarmerie had to choose this of all times to come snooping along
                              the path. I started to pick flowers guilelessly but he was suspicious of my camera
                              or something and wouldn’t go away. He just stood there plucking his mustachios and
                              eyeing me steadily. I didn’t dare call to Miss Edson to “stay put” of course, and
                              just what I was afraid of happening . . . did. All unaware she burst suddenly out
                              of the bushes a tall white goddess, resplendent in headgear and beads. The cop’s eyes
                              bulged out as big as saucers. I essayed a guilty grin. What a tableau! Miss Edson
                              retained her sangfroid.

                           <p id="d57013e1454">“What is this which this is?” sputtered the astonished copper.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d57013e1458">Explanations, proffered patiently, failed to placate his offended dignity. I thought
                              for a while we were headed for the hoosegow. The theatre was the place to photograph
                              sketchily clad dancers, not the Bois, the Majesty of the Law informed us. So the nymph
                              withdrew to her sylvan dell and covered her loveliness with a cloak. We picked up

                              of “Scram” ringing in our ears. We drove another half mile into the Bois and found
                              another al fresco studio, and this time made the pictures undisturbed.

                        <p id="d57013e1520">MADDER LAKE: The active coloring principle of this pigment is an organic dye-stuff,
                           Alizarin, of deep rich transparent ruby color, originally obtained from the root of
                           the Madder plant (Rubia Tinctorium). Today, this pigment, is synthetically prepared
                           from anthracene, a coal-tar derivative, whereby a more uniform, stable and brilliant
                           color is developed. Madder lakes and their modern equivalent, Alizarin Madders, owing
                           to their high degree of transparency, have always been valued for glazing. Those pigments
                           termed Lake Colors are all developed from organic dye-stuffs and now furnish a larger
                           number of pigments than all other groups of natural and artificial mineral origin.
                           The accidental discovery of the beautiful purple color, Mauve, from aniline (a coaltar
                           derivative) in 1856 by the English chemist Perkins, formed the starting point for
                           the inconceivable number of dyes developed since then. Most of the Lake pigments produced
                           with these dyestuffs unfortunately prove far too fugitive for use as artists’ pigments.
                           It was the introduction of many of these extremely brilliant Lake colors which has
                           been responsible for much damage to modern paintings. Not only do most of them fade,
                           but owing to their richness in oil, they lower in tone upon aging, and are notorious
                           crack producers where not properly employed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1524">Many artists are of the opinion that the Alizarin Madders or Madder Lakes are aniline
                           colors. In fact, it is almost a general conception that all Lake pigments are aniline
                           colors. The fact that aniline and anthracene are both derivatives of coal-tar, should
                           not lead the artist to believe that these products are identical in their properties.
                           Aniline derivatives constitute only one small group of the extremely large number
                           of dyes developed from coal-tar.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d57013e1527">The derivation of the name “Lake” is said by Pliny in his Naturalis Historia, A.D.
                           77, to be from the Lac or coloring principle, of insect origin used by the early Italian
                           dyers. In conjunction with compounds of tin and aluminum, the dye was precipitated
                           and fixed indelibly on fabric. During the process of dyeing some of the Lac combines
                           with some of the tin and aluminum to make an insoluble compound, forming a colored
                           scum on top of the dye-vat. This substance, called by the Italian dyers Lacca, was
                           collected, dried and sold to artists as a pigment. Soon the natural dyestuffs were
                           found to yield variously colored Lacca and methods were developed whereby the Lakes
                           were obtained direct and not as a residue or scum of the dye-vat. In fact, today,
                           the manufacture of Lake colors ranks commercially as important as the dye industry.

                           How impertinent and presumptuous they become if they desert their attics, visit the
                           barber regularly and attempt to face facts. Everyone knows they’re thoroughly impractical.
                           They should leave business to the financiers, politics to the politicians, in faith
                           that governments may come and governments may go but Art, protected by its aura, will
