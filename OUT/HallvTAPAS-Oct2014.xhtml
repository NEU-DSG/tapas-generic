                           it for her. One man after another told me it was time to go on. However, Pierce flew
                           back at the last moment, and we walked down the pier past a row of officials, each
                           of whom wanted to see one after another of our prized possessions; war zone cards,
                           baggage checks, passports, and finally all our money. I told the money man I had no
                           silver, and no gold banknotes, so he wasn't too fussy.

                           quiet Red Cross nurses, who were all anxious to see whom they had drawn for a fourth.

                        <p id="d47486e103">The gang planks were pulled up in about an hour—the thousand soldiers having been
                           marched down the pier before we were ordered on board—and we were all relieved to
                           know we should not have to spend the night at the hot dock.

                           gave us! I couldn't and even now can't believe that I was on the boat which was being
                           cheered, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e108"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="5" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span>instead of being consumed with envy on the one giving the farewell wave. It was lovely
                           going down the River. One of the nurses had her eyes glued on the New Jersey heights,
                           and said to me, "There is my house up there. All my family are watching me now from
                           the piazza." We passed many transports, loaded as we are, and then anchored for the
                           night off Hoffman Island to wait for the rest of our convoy.

                           Red Cross and Salvation Army people on board, all in their different uniforms, and
                           in the stateroom opposite ours are five White nuns from Quebec.

                        <p id="d47486e115">We watched the soldiers eat their dinner and wash their dishes in four great tanks
                           of water. While we ate ours, with its delicious French sauces and salad, the boys,
                           who were scattered about in groups all over the decks and in the rigging, began to
                           sing popular songs, which they kept up all the evening. It was all unreal; a heavenly
                           night with a full moon; Coney Island and Staten Island lights on the shore; two sausage
                           balloons near Brooklyn; and eight or ten other transports lying near by.

                        <p id="d47486e118">The next morning there was a new excitement every few minutes. One by one other transports

                           by a dirigible and a sausage balloon. There are twenty-three in our convoy.

                        <p id="d47486e123">Soon after we left the harbor, we were in war form. Guns pointed outward, lifeboats
                           swung out, ladders ready. In two hours the zigzagging began which we are to keep up
                           most of the way across.

                        <p id="d47486e126">At three o'clock we had our lifeboat drill. Having watched the soldiers we knew what
                           to do, and did it as a matter of course. Our boat is discouraging; there are three
                           children, the three nurses in my stateroom, some third class passengers, two officers,
                           and five nuns, a rather helpless collection. We adjusted each other’s life preservers,
                           and noticed that those on the small people doubled over a good deal in front, and
                           those on the large people wouldn't meet at all; but there was no joking about it.

                        <p id="d47486e129">At the bugle call at sunset, the port holes are closed and although they are painted
                           black, wooden covers are put over them to make doubly sure that no light can escape.
                           Every once in a while the first night, a soldier would forget and light a match, but
                           it was instantly put out.

                        <p id="d47486e133">It has been hot and breathless in the Gulf Stream. The balloons, chasers and aeroplanes
                           (which paid us occasional visits), left us one by one the first day, and now we are
                           sailing along calmly in a safety zone. It is sociable to have so much company<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e135"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="7" data-tei-n="4"> </a></span> on the ocean. Wherever you look there are big transports camouflaged in crazy ways,
                           one a perfect zebra, all going in different directions but all keeping together. A
                           tanker passed us a little while ago and the battleship fired three shots over her
                           bow. She was allowed to proceed, however, after giving a satisfactory account of herself.

                        <p id="d47486e138">Besides the large organizations, we have representatives of the Friends, and of Christian
                           Scientists, some of the Smith Unit—Ruth Gaines, author of "A Village in Picardy,"
                           a Miss Colgate, who is to join the Anne Morgan unit, as a master mechanic in charge
                           of ten trucks—they can be turned into ambulances if necessary—one of which was given
                           by her family. She is little, slight and attractive, and plays the piano most charmingly.
                           I hate to have her a mechanic for fear something will happen to her fingers. She has
                           studied with Leschetizky, and has evidently been a mechanic for some time. I know
                           less than anyone, almost, on board and feel I'd better ship for home right away.

                           of them, and fifteen of our kind. Our leader, Dr. Bradley, is especially nice. She
                           is taking over films to show the people how to take care of the young and coming generations.
                           I have the nicest nurses of all in my stateroom. They are from Seattle, Minnesota,

                           big man of very liberal views. He tried to make the service in every way he could,
                           but was too old, and finally accomplished his end in this way. His wife would have

                           another is an aviator, as are three nephews. He is living up to his conviction that
                           if America is not good enough to fight for, she is not good enough to live in, and
                           those who won't fight or work for her had better get out.

                           wanted a chance to do the military exercises. We furnish much amusement to the on-lookers.
                           After dinner we are called to attention by the bugle and stand up for medical inspection.
                           "We," the Red Cross, being semi-official, come under military control.

                           It's impossible to stay below after the air is shut out, so almost everyone spends
                           twenty-four hours on deck. I wish you could see me turning out for the night. I take
                           off my uniform, put on my lavender kimono and bedroom slippers, and either a sweater
                           or heavy coat; carry the big pillow off my bed, my little pillow and rug in one hand,
                           and my life preserver, which we are ordered<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e151"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="6"> </a></span> to keep within reach, in the other. I stumble up the stairs and have an awful time
                           opening the door. Then my gropings begin, for the deck is pitchy black, and my chair
                           is almost down at the other end of the ship. I have counted the lifeboats which I
                           have to pass, for they can generally be seen against the sky. Then to find the passage
                           into the back row where I am, I turn at right angles and walk forward until I bump
                           something and am sent "a little farther down;" not knowing how much, I repeat the
                           performance after a few steps, and another cheerful voice tells me to go still farther,
                           and perhaps even the number of chairs to pass before reaching the passage; but that
                           doesn't help a great deal, because I can see nothing. You can't imagine the relief
                           when someone takes your arm and says, "Here it is, two steps this way," and politely
                           shoves you towards your row. The marvel is that all the voices are so polite, for
                           it is more than likely I have waked everyone up. Half the time, too, I lose my balance,
                           and either my pillow or life preserver lands on top of them. After I have reached
                           the end of the passage, my real trouble begins, for my chair is the seventh or eighth
                           in, and the space between the rows is scarcely wide enough for one to walk in when
                           unincumbered. I plunge on, however, stumbling against the people on the outside row,
                           and on the rebound onto those on the inside. I never escape putting my hand on someone's
                           face; oftener than not it lands in their mouths. When I finally reach the place where<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e153"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="7"> </a></span> my chair ought to be, I begin to investigate each chair. If a rug is there already,
                           it probably does not belong to me, but it may, so I have to examine to see if someone
                           is under the rug. By this time I am in a state of hand-wringing, if I had any hands
                           I could wring, and at the height of my despair, some unknown man becomes discouraged
                           by the rumpus, gets up and settles me out of self-defense. One night it was too much
                           even for him, so he told me to go out to a vacant chair in the front row, where he
                           fixed me up with a second chair for my feet, so that I could lie down as flat as it
                           is possible in a chair with a hump in it. One awful night I settled myself in the
                           wrong chair, a long distance from mine. I was almost asleep when I noticed that my
                           neighbors did not seem familiar. Fearing that the owner might turn up, I thought I'd
                           better get out. I had made a terrible commotion getting in, and I felt like a fool
                           bundling out again, but I sneaked off as quietly as possible with all my luggage,
                           and finally found my own place.

                        <p id="d47486e156">I have been using the face of my wrist watch for a headlight on deck and it works
                           quite well when I put my arm across my chest, but that is forbidden, I discovered
                           one evening. A commanding voice from out of the blackness ordered "that light" out,
                           so there will be more collisions for me. I already have a skinned nose; another girl
                           has broken hers more or less.

                           nice at times to have been nearer the water. No one seems in the least nervous. The
                           Captain almost never appears. However, I think he feels pretty safe for the moment.
                           Dusk and dawn are the favorite times for the submarine attacks, but most of us go
                           below at dawn. Some mornings I have been caught in the deck-swabbing process and have
                           to hop up on the nearest unoccupied chair, to escape the tidal wave which dashes down
                           the deck.

                        <p id="d47486e165">The evenings have been rather dismal after the boys finished singing. Lights in the
                           Salle de Conversation are so dim that we can neither read nor play cards there. Finally
                           Mrs. Earle induced the Captain to open the dining saloon, where the light is better,
                           between nine and eleven. He needed a good deal of persuasion, as on other trips people
                           had insisted upon sleeping on the dining tables.

                           all the men with instruments. For about an hour they play for dancing, which gives
                           us a gay appearance. The music is delicious, it is so out of tune and queer, but it
                           has a swing and I enjoy it a lot. A quartette from below sometimes sings between the
                           dances, and one day two other boys came up. One played the piano and the other a violin,
                           which had only one string left. He held it like a cello and could play anything provided
                           his accompanist started in a low enough key.

                           to the boys. On Sunday the Y. M. C. A. and Salvation Army had a fifteen minute service.

                           Lord's Prayer, and we ended with "Onward Christian Soldiers." Not many boys took part.

                        <p id="d47486e181">We have had the usual concert and entertainment, which took about two hours—everything
                           of interest could have been done in fifteen minutes. Also a lecture on France, a mock
                           trial, etc., nothing very sprightly. Some spicy gossip, but I suppose that is to be
                           expected, conditions are so inviting.

                        <p id="d47486e185">We have to save electricity, water and ice. The water only runs in our basins at certain
                           times, and ice water is next to impossible to get. At each meal we have only one piece
                           of sour black bread and one lump of sugar, but everything else has the good French
                           flavor.

                        <p id="d47486e188">There has been a rumor of possible quarantine—fourteen days—because of mumps on board.
                           Rumors, too, that the other boats are annoyed with us because we go so slowly, and
                           have signalled if we don't hurry up, they will leave us. We answered we didn't care
                           if<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e190"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="10"> </a></span> they did. They zigzag more than we and go back and forth across our bow in rather
                           an impudent way. The officer in charge of our troops wonders why we were put in such
                           a fast convoy. I hear that one of our boilers is broken.

                        <p id="d47486e193">Finally, on the fifth day, all the boats except the Lorraine did leave us for England.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e196">Mrs. Earle has a pass which takes her all over the ship, as she teaches the soldiers
                           French every day. There are both French and Italian lessons going at all hours in
                           all parts of the boat.

                        <p id="d47486e199">On the second Sunday, the only service I heard was the little vesper singing from
                           the nuns' cabin. It was very pretty and calming in the midst of the turmoil. No one
                           is sensational, but the feeling of not knowing 
                           <add id="d47486e201" hand="mh">"</add>what's doing
                           <add id="d47486e204" hand="mh">"</add> makes an undercurrent of suppressed excitement. Of course none of the boat's employees
                           are allowed to say a word. If all the reports flying around were true, we should have
                           been at the bottom of the Atlantic long ago. We always get daily war bulletins.

                        <p id="d47486e208">One night we were told that the Captain ordered the soldiers to keep their life preservers
                           with them every instant. We had received an S.O.S. from a boat that was fighting a
                           submarine not far from us, someone said; we could not find out where. We were all
                           advised but not ordered to sleep out. For some reason I could not get excited, but
                           I put Mother's little green bag under my pillow, with my brandy, malted milk tablets
                           and flashlight in it, which added one more hump to my bed. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e210"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="14" data-tei-n="11"> </a></span>That night, just as I reached my chair, three most awful flashes came from my bundle.
                           Two or three exclaimed, "What is that!" Luckily no officer was near. I dropped everything
                           in hopes the light would go out on the way down. Evidently a bottle had pushed the
                           connection and lighted the bulb of my flashlight.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e214">From the time of the S.O.S. scare we were in the danger zone again. The Lorraine was
                           lost and we were alone
                           <add id="d47486e216" hand="mh">,</add> at the mercy of any old thing
                           <add id="d47486e219" hand="mh">,</add> in a terribly slow tub.

                        <p id="d47486e223">At five o'clock in the morning of the day before we landed, I saw two boats steaming
                           straight for us. It didn't take them long to catch us, and I discovered that they
                           were our convoy; two French torpedo boats. They certainly were sturdy and looked as
                           if they had seen hard service. They zigzagged full speed around us and across our
                           bow, until we reached the river. It seemed good to have company again, and the people
                           on board were relieved. Our last night was supposed to be the most dangerous, and
                           almost everyone slept out.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e226">Some one called "Land!" on the morning of September 4th, and I saw the coastline quite
                           distinctly, with its sand dunes and a tall white lighthouse in their midst. There
                           were lots of little red-sailed fishing boats about, and an observation balloon attached
                           to a boat which brought out our pilot. Then the torpedo boats left us.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e229">After luncheon, the police, medical and customs inspectors came on board. I was the
                           first to pass the police line, and they forgot to ask if I had a camera, so I was
                           lucky! The customs inspector chalked <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e231"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span>my luggage and then asked if I had any sugar. I said "Yes," and he laughed and said
                           it was forbidden, but he wouldn't say anything about a little. (The hospitals get
                           what is taken away from people).

                        <p id="d47486e234">As we passed the American docks and buildings, the French kept saying, "America, all
                           America!" There were miles of them. The first American locomotive we saw received
                           a great cheer from the newcomers, and a Ford which hurried along right after it received
                           a greater one. We were cheered and saluted constantly and asked where we came from,
                           by many voices on the shore.

                        <p id="d47486e237">About fifteen minutes after we passed the American docks, we landed at Bordeaux, hoping
                           they would not ship us up to Paris in the night train.

                        <p id="d47486e256">I have seen your French family. We landed at six o'clock, and were to take the ten
                           o'clock train out. At the wharf we were piled into an army truck, balanced ourselves
                           on the side rails and were rattled over the cobblestones to the centre of Bordeaux.
                           There we were turned loose, with orders to be at the station at nine. It was then
                           after seven, and Senon is on the other side of the river. At the pier I had asked
                           a woman if we could go there, and she said it was too far, so I didn't talk much to
                           her. I attacked a man next. He was much more encouraging and said we could do it in
                           a taxicab. That was easier said than done. We flew around, talked to all the drivers
                           of all the private cars we saw and to all the policemen. Finally a chauffeur pointed
                           out a cab he thought was not taken. We rushed madly at it, found the driver in a café
                           having a drink, but he decided to take us for twenty francs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e259">In Senon no one knew the street. We went to the post office, and found that it began
                           with an S instead of an L, which made some difference. After we had driven for a while
                           through the picturesquely curved little street, with low houses and gardens, we asked
                           a woman where Mme. Olivier lived. She answered quickly, "Here, and there she is."
                           We called her and asked her husband's name, to make sure we had made no mistake. She
                           was somewhat overcome, but instantly <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e261"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="17" data-tei-n="14"> </a></span>asked us to her room, which was upstairs in what she called an old château. I guess
                           anything not a peasant's house is a château here. She said at once, "These things
                           do not belong to me; I have nothing." There were two beds, a little stove, three chairs,
                           a table and cupboard, with a poor assortment of dishes. On the bed was a big pile
                           of aprons which she was making for three cents apiece. She is a quick, bright woman,
                           little and bent, probably from her hardships while she lived under German rule, (their
                           home was in the Pas de Calais) and her escape under fire, with dead and wounded lying
                           all about her; she wading through mud and water, sometimes almost up to her waist,
                           carrying her little child to safety.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e264">She put some shavings in her stove and said at least she could make good coffee. We
                           had a cup apiece, but only one teaspoon for all of us! She had some sugar which she
                           made us take. I hated to, but she said she could get a little once in a while—because
                           she has a child, I imagine. It grew dark but she did not light a candle; perhaps she
                           had none.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e267">After coffee we went to see "le petit Florent," who was making a call on his grandmother,
                           Olivier's mother. He was pale and much like the picture of his father. The grandmother
                           was frail and nice; also Olivier's sister—she was writing to her brother when we went
                           in—very pretty and polite. They, too, wanted to give us coffee, but finally brought
                           out their good Bordeaux wine and we all had some, "le petit" even, in a little glass
                           of his own. They talked much of <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e269"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="15"> </a></span>the grandfather; how the Boches had forced him to work in the mud and rain and he
                           had had pneumonia and died the next day, and "such a good husband
                           <add id="d47486e271" hand="mh">,</add> and a man who had never been sick before in his life." They all worked for the Germans,
                           were paid a bit by the town, and were fed by the Americans. Your poilu is getting
                           better. He was gassed and the Salonicá fever came back. I think they were glad to
                           see us.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e276">On the way back to Bordeaux we saw a big fire in a phosphate factory, but quite unlike
                           America, no one seemed to pay much attention to it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e279">We had no time for dinner, and were packed, six of us, into a compartment and left
                           for the night. No one slept a wink. A night like that, on top of twelve other wakeful
                           nights on the boat was certainly a cap to the climax. When we reached Paris we were
                           the worst looking, dirtiest crowd you ever saw, ever in your whole life. The Y.M.C.A.
                           had fine accommodations in Bordeaux and came up on the day train, rested and ready
                           for work. The Red Cross man (English in American Service) who met us acted as though
                           he couldn't get rid of us fast enough and said there were no rooms in Bordeaux. Some
                           of the girls tried to wash up and do their hair, but I was discouraged with the outlook
                           and toilet accommodations, so made no attempt.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e282">Going through Orleans we saw our first German prisoners—stolid fellows with set jaws,
                           and W.P. on their caps and shirts. Mrs. Earle was dying to speak to them, but it seemed
                           best not to take a chance. They were sweeping off the platform and stopped to watch
                           the train.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d47486e287">At Paris I rushed down the platform and got a girl porter to go back with me to lug
                           my heavy things; felt like a criminal; it was that or nothing, though. She staggered
                           under the load but was nice about it when I offered to help and said it wasn't necessary.
                           No one knew what to do; finally a Red Cross man came along and he didn't know much
                           more, so I started ahead to the street with my porter, where we found a pleasant Miss
                           Allen, who collected baggage checks, divided us into different living quarters, put
                           us into army trucks and told us we were to register at Red Cross Headquarters at ten
                           o'clock. It was then half past nine. She said she could not be cruel enough to ask
                           us to get no breakfast, but requested us not to wash up, but to go as we were, for
                           a hundred and twenty-five were expected the next hour from Italy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e290">We were taken miles up Avenue Victor Hugo and deposited in a pension where nothing
                           was ready; not a room to go to, no water, no breakfast, but Madame, in a kimono, hurried
                           up coffee, which we drank out of great bowls, ate a hunk of bread, and then flew back
                           to the trucks, which landed us at the office a little after ten. We were enrolled,
                           signed more papers, gave more references, etc. Finished at twelve, and were told we
                           were to go to see someone at two o'clock, another at three and another at four.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e294">We lunched down town and I engaged a room, bath and meals at Hotel de l'Arcade, where
                           the Smith girls are, for twenty-two francs. We can have hot water only Saturday and
                           Sunday, a law to save coal. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e296"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="20" data-tei-n="17"> </a></span>I could not stay in that pension and room with another girl. After two weeks of discomfort
                           I felt that I must have quiet, rest and privacy, at least, while I could.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e299">Between two and three I rushed down to the U.S. Provost Marshall and registered there,
                           which has to be done within the first twenty-four hours. Then at three there was a
                           lecture by Mr. Gibson about Red Cross work and after that they tried to send us to
                           the French police for our cards of identification, but could not get transportation
                           for all of us. Two of us, Hospital Hut women, were turned over to somebody else, who
                           was not in the office, so I went back to Avenue Victor Hugo for my luggage and settled
                           at this hotel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e302">I have no hopes of getting anywhere near the front. The Red Cross does not send women
                           near, they tell me. They may only say that because everybody wants to go, and the
                           easiest way out of it for them is to say "Nothing doing!" Salvation Army is what I
                           want and I wish to goodness I had tried for it. It's getting late and I ought to go
                           to sleep. Paris is lovely. The valuable monuments are covered with concrete casings
                           feet deep. Tell Mother it is lucky she wasn't spending the winter in her Paris room;
                           it served as a target for one of the shells of the big gun and the place is shattered.
                           I took a look at it today. It's a favorite locality for the Gothas, also. We are just
                           back of the Madeleine. They all say the Germans are too busy now to think of raids
                           or big guns. Lots of military people here, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e304"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span>but there always have been in Paris. There are about as many Americans as French.
                           Have not seen sugar of any kind. Horses all look thin. I have only seen one well fed;
                           the others are pitiful. I mentioned it to a policeman and he said the people were
                           the same, and he certainly did look white and thin. I think I feel too tired to have
                           things penetrate very much yet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e307">I have met a good many Bryn Mawr girls, among them Emily Cross, who told me to try
                           for the work I wanted and not to be in too much of a hurry, so I decided not to sign
                           up with any department yet awhile. As I was supposed to do Search work and not Hut,
                           I went to Mrs. Moore's office. Read casualty letters and reports, to see if I could
                           do the work. They almost made me weep; in fact they did depress me the whole morning.
                           I should have to write letters about the boys' last words; what they did and said,
                           their funerals, etc., and collect all the information I could to send to their parents.
                           I almost decided to take it, but just before the office closed I thought I'd make
                           one more try for the front, and canteen work, which I really want, so went to see
                           Mrs. Vanderbilt. She was out, but I saw Miss Burnett. I had heard somewhere that the
                           only canteens the Red Cross have near the front are French ones, and as I like the
                           idea of working with the French, I asked for a French canteen. Miss Burnett immediately
                           said that they had just had a call for more workers for Châlons, and she thought I
                           could go there, but told me to see Mrs. Vanderbilt on Monday, so my hopes are high.
                           The Y.M.C.A. and Salvation Army have all the near front <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e309"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="22" data-tei-n="19"> </a></span>places.

                        <p id="d47486e312">If I get the Châlons work I shall have to stay here ten days longer. I am glad not
                           to rush right away, for I am tired and have a cold. Everyone seems to have one. It
                           is not warm, and rains part of every day already, so the bad weather has begun early.

                        <p id="d47486e315">We have had to search for our trunks, which were at a station far out of the way.
                           While waiting to get them, we went to the American Red Cross canteen in the station,
                           and were treated to rice and coffee; the rice, cooked with a little lemon peel and
                           milk, was delicious.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e319">This is a refugee canteen, and in it was a group of about twenty from Amiens; old
                           men and women; one young woman with a baby which was pale and thin. She told me her
                           husband had gone crazy from shell shock. One of the old women had been travelling
                           all round the country, trying to find some of her family who would take her and no
                           one could or would, so she had come back to Paris. They were all crying, some very
                           hard; the old men and all. I almost added to the chorus by weeping too, and again
                           had misgivings as to the value I'd be over here. The canteen workers told them they
                           must be brave; that we were pushing the Germans back and soon they could go home,
                           but they said they had been told they could not return for eight or nine months. A
                           French woman, a lady, wife of a high official, was writing a letter to the mayor of
                           a town, to ask him to let an old woman go home. She said she knew it would do no good,
                           but it made the woman feel better. They had started up the phonograph and a little
                           girl was playing the violin, to divert them, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e321"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span>and after a while the weeping gradually stopped.

                        <p id="d47486e324">We had happened to meet the Smith girls, who were on a trunk hunt too, so we stayed
                           together and all thought this our first hard taste of war.

                        <p id="d47486e327">Mrs. Earle found an agreeable Egyptian working at the canteen who persuaded the director
                           of the station to send our luggage to the hotel in a refugee omnibus, so we all piled
                           in and sat on top of the trunks.

                        <p id="d47486e330">Early Monday morning I saw Mrs. Vanderbilt and boldly asked for Châlons, which she
                           gave to me, probably. I am not sure that she liked my asking for it, but I am so delighted
                           to get it that I am almost like a Cheshire cat.

                        <p id="d47486e335">I don't write every day or two, because steamers don't go very often and I am generally
                           too tired to write at night and too much occupied during the day trying to do all
                           I can, to give up the time to letter writing. I feel it is my one great opportunity
                           to see things. It is rather hard, even for me, for I did not know one thing when I
                           came and everyone is so rushed with their own business that they don't have time to
                           bother with anyone else. I hesitate to ask a question of anyone, so all the information
                           I have I have acquired "by the way." No French person of authority likes to tell you
                           anything in the way of facts, which adds to the difficulty. Then locomotion is difficult.

                           The Metro. is always filled with a pushing, elbowing mob, and anyway you have to walk
                           about as far under ground as you would if you went all the way on foot over ground,
                           so that is unsatisfactory, too. I can't seem to find any omnibus lines to go anywhere
                           in now, so I go on my feet as much as I can and understand why they tell you to bring
                           over a good supply of shoes.

                        <p id="d47486e341">I think the last time I wrote I was uncertain about landing Châlons. I have it, I
                           think. It is in the French zone and it takes longer to get papers to go there than
                           it does to the American, so I am here for a week longer, anyway, as the French papers
                           could not be started until my Red Worker's card came. I know that I have to get my
                           board and lodging off the town, and they say that the climate is so bad that you feel
                           like cutting the fog with a knife in order to breathe. I also know that the people
                           in the canteen are worn out, and the office here hopes that my temper is good. It
                           is one of the best equipped canteens, I'm told,—a most desirable one, with an attractive
                           staff of workers, and one that is given as a reward for work in less interesting places.

                           managed. As we entered we saw bunches of flowers tied with red, white and blue ribbon,
                           evidently for boys who would never go home. A chaplain offered to take us around.
                           He stopped to speak to the very sick boys. I felt awkward about going up to the beds
                           and talking; they looked too sick to be bothered. Those I did speak to were in chairs,
                           wheeling themselves around. One boy from Detroit with half a leg gone was so cheerful
                           that I wondered how it <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e363"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="23"> </a></span>was possible to have so much courage. He had been two weeks in the hospital and expected
                           to be out in another. Everything that money and skill can give the boys is there;
                           the hospital is enormous. Practically all the patients are surgical cases. Some of
                           the wards look almost like factories, arms and legs by the hundreds are suspended
                           in such queer hanging apparatus, having the Dakin treatment. The chaplain wanted us
                           to watch the doctors dress a typical shell wound. I hated to stare at the boy, but
                           looked at them take off the dressing and saw the great deep hole in his thigh. We
                           went through the ward for face wounds, but it was so shocking that I tried to see
                           nothing. All the nurses look like ladies. We saw Mary Hoyt in her ward. A "searcher"
                           was at work in another ward. Somehow I feel so stunned by it all that it doesn’t seem
                           to sink in. I have no feelings left. I am glad that I am not to be a

                        <p id="d47486e372">When we came out we tried to go for a little drive in the Bois, but no one would take
                           us; it is not allowed, they must save gas. We walked round a little, saw loving couples,
                           and came home for tea in our rooms. No food is served in France between meal hours.

                        <p id="d47486e375">A day or two later we went to the Red Cross hospital on a race course at Auteuil.
                           This is all of big tents, not a single building. They say they are to keep it open
                           all winter. I'm sorry for the nurses; one had just died of pneumonia. Perhaps the
                           patients can keep warm under blankets. Their flag was at half mast and we were told
                           there had just been a funeral. We saw the camions and a few soldiers forming behind
                           to go to the cemetery with them. It was a pathetic little <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e377"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span>company, with no one who really cared, only soldiers whose business it was to go with
                           them. We watched them start. On each coffin was a bunch of flowers and I suppose a
                           little aluminum identification disk, to be nailed to his white cross.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e380">The hospital was full of gassed patients. There are all sorts of villainous gasses,
                           for external and internal torture, and sometimes they get the whole collection at
                           once. They were a nice class of boys, many from Pennsylvania; you have probably read
                           about them; they kept things busy around here for a while. They told us that fresh
                           air was their only cure. Most of them wear colored glasses and their throats are so
                           burned that they can scarcely speak. They had been trapped, they said; gone into dugouts
                           near Soissons, left by the Germans, who had planted gas bombs with only stoppers in
                           them, and when the boys walked on them the stoppers fell out and they were gassed—eighteen
                           hundred of them!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e383">Of course they tell us all sorts of interesting and remarkable tales, some almost
                           incredible; such as German women, sixteen of them, fighting like men and fighting
                           well. The Americans did not know it until they had shot four. The others were taken.
                           The story is doubted, so take it for what it is worth. It was told me by a poor boy
                           who could speak only in a very low whisper. The shell which killed his two companions
                           and school chums had taken off his mask and knocked him unconscious. He had thought
                           he never could kill a man, but found it simple when the time came. He showed us the
                           scar the other fellow's <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e385"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="25"> </a></span>bayonet had made first, and now he is crazy to get back to avenge his friends. He
                           had seen Germans chained to their machine guns, and said the prisoners were half fed
                           and glad to be taken, but treacherous always.

                        <p id="d47486e389">We went to the Hospital Hut, which was crowded with men able to walk. It was a beautiful
                           day, and they were out all over the grounds in pajamas and bathrobes. I even saw them
                           down at the gates of Paris in that costume, pushing each other in wheeled chairs.
                           We were shown about the food storehouse. The man told us that morning it had been
                           practically empty, but when we saw it, it was well stocked; great bottles of malted
                           milk, sugar, flour, etc., and barrels of home made American preserves and jellies,
                           made by our women, labeled in their own writing, and arrived at their destination
                           in good condition. I was so glad to see them. I guess the boys will be gladder. They
                           were having canned salmon hash for supper that night and good looking fresh beans.
                           They all thought it a fine hospital, and appeared to like the way they were treated.
                           In the Hut they were playing games and smoking, those who could; being served ice
                           cream and fruit, both of which are good for their burned throats, and one, a musical
                           genius, who had been a patient and had been begged off from going back for a while
                           longer because of his gift for entertaining, was playing an accompaniment for another
                           who was singing an original ditty about a cootie and her family which arrived a day
                           after she did, and their families which came the next day. I imagine the cootie is
                           a source of inspiration to many <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e391"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span>an impromptu poet. It was an interesting scene and I couldn't help thinking how many
                           mothers would have given all they possessed to be where I was at that moment. The
                           strong patients always help the weak ones to get about.

                        <p id="d47486e394">We sometimes go out to take a look at Paris in the dark; there are no lights. Street
                           lamps are covered with black shades and bulbs are painted blue. All window shutters
                           are closed and curtains drawn. The police came after us one night because we had not
                           pulled ours low enough. Automobiles have only faint sidelights, painted blue. You
                           almost walk into people on the street. Before I dare to go out I always study the
                           map until I have a mental picture of where I am going, as it is impossible ever to
                           
                           <hi id="d47486e396" style="text-decoration: underline;" n="mh">see</hi> where you are.

                        <p id="d47486e400">I bought the first white bread I've had in months at the American Commissary yesterday.
                           Had to carry it, a can of jam and bundle of matches under my arm unwrapped. Everyone
                           carries bread in that way, so I was in the fashion. On the way home I went into a
                           shop, and the people could not get over such "joli pain." They,
                           <add id="d47486e402" hand="mh">—</add>three women and a soldier,
                           <add id="d47486e405" hand="mh">—</add>patted it, caressed it, smelled it, exclaiming all the time, "quel joli pain, just
                           like cake." I offered them some, but they would not take it. They were full of the
                           big American victory at St. Mihiel.

                        <p id="d47486e409">Sunday I went alone to Notre Dame. On my way met a sailor from the Mount Vernon, who
                           told me about the torpedoing. He said it was a marvel that they got her to port; that
                           the captain considers it a perfect crew, and wants to keep them together on some boat.
                           After Notre Dame <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e411"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="30" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span>went to St. Gervais to see the Good Friday ruin. The worst was all shut off, so no
                           one could see it. A stone column fell and I think that did most of the damage. In
                           the afternoon we went in search of the American soldiers' cemetery at Sûresnes. We
                           had a hard time finding it, as no one seemed to know just what we wanted. Got into
                           a taxicab driven by a Greek and finally after much inquiry and talk we found it, on
                           the side of a clay hill, under Mt. Valerien.

                           </choice> There is a beautiful view of Paris from there. It is just a small plot, surrounded
                           by a white wooden fence, with very many, three or four hundred, little white crosses,
                           as near together as possible, and places, some already dug, for more who are to come.
                           They come every day, the French told us; in the morning the men to prepare and in
                           the afternoon the little funeral processions, always at the same time. The French
                           people in the neighborhood adopt the graves, put a metal plate with their own names
                           on the crosses, and always see that the grass is kept green or fresh flowers put on
                           every few days. Some take many graves. One man has taken a whole row, and comes each
                           day to bring flowers. If he is prevented, he sends his maid. She was there on Sunday,
                           and told us about it. The graves adopted by the well-to-do people have elaborate wreaths
                           of bead flowers, grass borders and flowering plants on them. Those are often officers'
                           graves. The ones adopted by the poorer women have fresh flower
                           <add id="d47486e418" hand="mh">s</add> also, but they are laid on top of the yellow clay. Whether adopted by rich or poor
                           they are cared for with great tenderness and reverence, and when we thanked them,
                           they always <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e421"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="28"> </a></span>said, "Poor boys, they have won all we can give them, and they are so far from their
                           homes and their mothers, we do for them what we should like to have done for us."
                           It was quite full of French that day; we were the only Americans, and I was so glad
                           that I had made the effort to go. It is hard to get to and perhaps that is why people
                           don't do it. One woman came up to us before we left; she had adopted one of the graves
                           made the day before, one of those boys whose funeral we saw start from the hospital,
                           and she wanted to know how old the soldier was, for she had a boy of nineteen in the
                           army and expected him home soon, and she wanted to tell him all about the Americans
                           who had died for France. We said quickly, "Twenty-two," for we knew she wanted an
                           answer. There were flowers on his grave and she couldn't understand it, as long as
                           it was her grave. I told her probably a friend or soldier companion had put the flowers
                           there, and that calmed and satisfied her. She was evidently jealous already, to think
                           that someone else could touch her possession. As we came away a nice American boy
                           stopped us and asked if he could show us the way to the train. He is in the searchlight
                           service of the defense of Paris on Mt. Valerien.

                           </choice> He explained to us how the air raids took place, how they telephoned ahead when the
                           Germans passed certain points, and we all decided that they had enough to do without
                           annoying Paris again, so I was much surprised when I was waked that night (Sunday,
                           September 15th) by Mrs. Earle's voice, saying, "Margaret, the sirens are blowing,
                           get up!" I think if she hadn't called me I should have slept through <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e429"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="29"> </a></span>the whole thing. You can just guess that Margaret did get up and in a hurry too. I
                           didn't dare turn on the light, so fumbled round for my kimono and fur coat. Then I
                           grabbed my money and flashlight and flew into Mrs. Earle's room, where we stayed hanging
                           out the window for an hour and a half. She said her knees were shaking so with excitement
                           that she could scarcely stand. I was crazy to go out to get a full view from Place
                           de la Concorde, which was of course impossible. When I got to Mrs. Earle's room the
                           "alerte" was in full blast. First three guns go off, before the sirens, which by the
                           way are on top of all the churches (most peculiar looking megaphone affairs, pointing
                           in all directions); then comes the "alerte"—the sirens. Everyone on the street is
                           supposed to rush to the nearest shelter, but how they can see where they are, I don't
                           see, as the streets are pitchy black. On almost all the houses there are signs saying,
                           shelter for fifty, or any number their cellars will hold, and people all pile in.
                           Mrs. Earle and I decided we would see one raid through. It was blood curdling to hear
                           the sirens. They sounded like enormous creatures cornered, moaning and wailing for
                           help. Finally they grew fainter and fainter, and at last seemed almost like echoes
                           as we heard them from other parts of the city. In two or three minutes, we saw flashes
                           of light in the sky and knew the defense of Paris must be at work. Then the searchlights
                           began. They came up from all directions and searched the sky. Soon we heard the rumble
                           of distant guns, which grew louder and louder and finally became an incessant roar.
                           Shells <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e431"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span>began to burst near us and we heard the whirl of German aeroplanes approaching. They
                           came nearer and nearer and the explosions became louder and louder, until finally
                           they seem to be right over our heads, flying very low. No French planes go up, for
                           they are caught in their own barrage if they do. The Germans kept going back and forth,
                           and in a few moments we saw a red reflection in the sky and knew something had been
                           set on fire. It was all so thrilling that I couldn't feel. I just stared until I thought
                           my eyes would pop out. The bombs looked like little flashlights in the sky, and the
                           exploding shrapnel like falling stars only brighter. We seemed surrounded by fireworks
                           on all sides, and I couldn't realize that it was the real thing and not a Fourth of
                           July celebration. Once in a while before the raid really started someone would turn
                           on a light or light a match and then voices from out of the darkness would call, "Lumiére,"
                           dragging the "ére" and the light would disappear instantly. After the raid we all
                           went to bed and at 3.30 were waked by another "alerte" and the whole performance was
                           repeated, only it did not last so long, and the Boche&lt;add hand="mh"&gt;s&lt;/add&gt; did not
                           break through the barrage that time. At the end the church bells ring and a bugler
                           goes round the streets playing a cheerful little tune—the "berloque." After it was
                           over I went to see the Smith girls. They had been hurried down into the cellar by
                           the clerk and had spent the night there. In the middle of the affair the maid remarked
                           that the ladies of 24 and 29 were not there, so the manager flew up to get us, but
                           either was sidetracked <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e433"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="31"> </a></span>or could not make us hear, for we never saw him at all. The girls said it was quite
                           funny in the cellar; one woman fainted and had to be handed out; some of the women
                           appeared in magnificent Parisian hats, and some with their hair in strings down their
                           backs; some men in pajamas and others in swallow tails, shirtless and collarless.
                           It was an amusing crowd, I imagine. The clerk would say every once in a while, "Here
                           they come nearer; now they are flying over us," etc. There were slugs on the walls
                           and floors and I am glad we were too ignorant to realize our danger, for if we had
                           seen the destruction which we saw the next day, we should have hesitated that night
                           about standing in such an exposed position. It takes quite a while to get details
                           about a raid, and not much is ever told. About a dozen people were killed by flying
                           shrapnel, mostly those in the streets, and the material damage was great. The next
                           morning Mary Hoyt and I went to view the ruins. It was a big raid and a very long
                           one. The Germans came in waves from all directions, the paper said, and dropped many
                           bombs. Two German planes were brought down, one was found near Paris with three Germans
                           killed beside it. We expected a raid the next night but had a thunder shower instead,
                           and each night since it has rained. They had arranged to come every night for ten
                           nights, up to the 25th, so papers found on a captured officer said. They say Paris
                           was at its wits end the day the big gun began. The sirens kept blowing steadily for
                           three hours and people almost lost their senses. No one knew what had struck them.

                           <add id="d47486e440" hand="mh">,</add> was to go to see the refugee quarters at St. Sulpice, where fifteen hundred refugees
                           are kept all the time, and where during the German drive two or three thousand were
                           kept over night often. They came, whole towns at a time, in camions and canal boats,
                           and sometimes drawn by their own horses, bringing as many of their household belongings
                           as they could get together, and as many of their animals and pets as they could manage.
                           One woman refused to go to bed without her goat; she got it upstairs and into bed,
                           and not until the police went after her did she give it up. Another woman arrived
                           with ninety-three bundles; she took up a whole camion for herself and was checked
                           in and out of St. Sulpice the next morning without losing one! Some days they give
                           one or two hundred babies baths before they start off at eight in the morning. The
                           babies are always washed and given new clothes before they are sent away. It is quite
                           a wonderfully arranged place. A babies' hospital, a theatre, a garden for the children
                           to play in, monks' cells for the residents to live in, and in the corridors countless
                           cot beds for those passing through. There is also a part reserved for soldiers of
                           the devastated country, who have no homes to go to during their

                           train. The freight station is used for the evacuations and the platform between the
                           sanitary trains is full of tents with a little kitchen in between them. We talked
                           to the boys—there were three hundered and ten of them—the convalescents, who seemed
                           charmed to be amused, all except one boy, a professional singer, who had been gassed
                           and lost his voice; he was so discouraged that nothing we could say had any effect—his
                           life had been ruined and he might as well die now and have it over. Those on the stretchers
                           in the train we did not see. A Red Cross lieutenant soon told those who were walking
                           about to form a line, and cigarettes, coffee and sandwiches were passed by French
                           women, who always said, "From the American Red Cross."

                           rather the place where it is. It is covered with a pyramid of sandbags; thousands
                           and thousands of them, some rotting and letting out the sand, which gives the place

                           vine-covered walls, and peeping through the gates into lovely gardens.

                           she and her pupils danced, is full of cots; the mirrors have been painted over. I
                           asked if Isadora comes out to dance for the boys and the nurse said, "No." We talked
                           to some of the patients, who looked well. They remarked that they might look well,
                           but if they felt energetic and walked a step too far they were apt to fall dead at
                           any moment. "They do it every day," one said.

                        <p id="d47486e479">Mrs. Earle and I were fortunate in having a chance to see a hospital train straight
                           from the front come in at La Chapelle. Strangers are not made very welcome at that
                           station. It is a French army post and they don't care to have Americans there. Some
                           women have fainted and acted so foolishly that the Red Cross has been requested to
                           bring only two each night as interpreters. It was a train of our boys coming down
                           from Soissons and expected at eleven o'clock. We started from here about nine thirty,
                           but heard when we arrived that the train would not get in until two. The French nurses
                           were kind and invited us to sleep on hospital cots in their quarters and as there
                           seemed to be some friction in the American Red Cross room and a very cross <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e481"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>lieutenant in charge, we decided to keep away, and accepted their invitation. There
                           were about a dozen steel helmets hanging up on the walls, which the nurses have to
                           wear when they work during the raids. We were called in time to see the big U.S.A.
                           train back slowly into the station. The suspense was frightful for me. It was my nearest
                           approach to the battlefield, and no one knew whether we were to have one of those
                           trains of agonized gassed boys or a simple wounded train. However, I felt reassured
                           when I saw some of the boys lean out of the windows. First the walking cases came
                           hobbling out, some in uniform and some in dressing gowns. They were sent off as quickly
                           as possible. Then the stretcher cases were brought into the enormous hall and the
                           stretchers placed on iron rails made to hold them. We had to get pillows for their
                           heads, blankets for them if they were cold, and after the doctors had read the tags
                           which were pinned on their clothes, and had given each a number card, which showed
                           the hospital to which he was to be taken, we went round and gave chocolate or coffee
                           to all except those who had Number 8. They were fever cases and could have no food.
                           They had all been to first aid stations, but we were told to look out for fresh blood
                           or for arms or legs in uncomfortable positions. Three hundred and forty came on that
                           train, one real American Indian among them. At four o'clock everything was over and
                           we were sent home in an ambulance.

                           hut worker took us about. While we were in the court we saw a little procession coming
                           towards us. It was those who had just died being taken out. The chaplain came first,
                           bareheaded, with an officer, and then four men carrying a pine coffin covered with
                           our flag; then four more carrying another, and following them two or three privates.
                           They went through an arch into another court, and came back in a moment to return
                           again with two more coffins. After they had passed, we followed them, and saw the
                           big camion standing there still waiting, and the little procession starting back once
                           more. They returned immediately carrying others. As they were coming through the arch
                           an officer signalled to some patients who were well enough to be sitting outside,
                           to stand. We saw seven driven off. The hospital hut

                           it, waking at four to be sure to be at the office before it opened. There I was told
                           they were going to try to rush us through without papers, as there was to be a great

                           looking place; officers of all kinds and descriptions, in their grand clothes, trying
                           to find their trains. Three important trains left at the same time and were all packed
                           full of officers. The Red Cross had reserved a seat for me, so I was next the window.
                           They also paid my fare, which was almost nothing, as we have military rates. In the
                           compartment were three officers, a priest, and another Red Cross woman going to the
                           Châlons canteen.

                        <p id="d47486e533">It was, of course, a thrilling journey. At Meaux were the first signs of the Germans;
                           as we went farther we realized what an invasion means. Villages half or wholly destroyed,
                           all desolate and awful, but not wholly deserted. Bridges down; old pontoons pulled
                           up on the banks of the Marne, which is only a narrow stream now. I was so surprised
                           when I saw the size of it. There were barbed wire entanglements by the mile, put up
                           with no reason, so far as the untrained eye could see; dugouts and abris along the
                           hillsides, and now and then a soldier's grave with his little cross and his steel
                           helmet upon it. They looked so lonely there on the railroad embankment. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e535"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="fp38"> </a></span>

                           holes, and in the midst of it all, little boys and old women were gathering the harvest.
                           We did not see the real battlefield, so the officers told us; but if that wasn't real,
                           Heaven only knows what is.

                           most inviting place for Boche
                           <add id="d47486e554" hand="mh">s</add> raids, and were then sent in a little Red Cross camion across the river to Miss Nott,
                           the

                           at the first place to which Miss Nott sent me, so the soldier in her service came
                           with a wheelbarrow and took me to another house, where an untidy French working woman
                           showed me the room she had. I had immediate misgivings, which proved to be well founded,
                           for with the exception of cooties, everything else arrived that night. I slaughtered
                           them by the dozens. When I told the woman the next morning, she only said, "Oh! did
                           they sortis?" So I continued my hunt and now have a room with all the glass in the
                           windows, a thing most unusual for Châlons, and a fireplace also, too small, though,
                           to have much effect in this high studded room. I've bought some wood at a fabulous
                           price, but don't burn it unless I want to get a bath, which so far in my career I
                           feel obliged to do. The downward path is fast, though, they say, and as the weather
                           gets colder, I can't tell just how low I'll sink. I asked one of the girls what she
                           did last winter, and she said, "Oh, I just went into winter <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e563"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="fp39"> </a></span>

                           to the poilus. They say Epernay was more "intime."

                           that a big dormitory where blankets are rented and stretchers given. Shower baths
                           and barber shop are provided, and in the garden there are wine and tobacco kiosks
                           and officers’ quarters. Every artist in the world ought to come up here.

                           hats, thoroughly unpopular with the everyday soldier; and then in smaller numbers,
                           but always increasing as time goes on, are our boys, white and colored, in khaki,
                           some wearing service caps, some steel helmets; all nations together, pushing and stretching
                           towards the counter, waiting to be fed. I think I told Mother how the colored boys
                           from around New Orleans, who could speak French, had things their way at Limoges.
                           There were a lot of them there and they went around telling the French that they were
                           the real Americans and to pay no attention to the white boys. Their success was enormous.

                           from the French Grand Headquarters and I don't want to stir up trouble by being asked
                           for something that I can't produce. They are frightfully fussy about things like that,
                           and although I was allowed to come paperless, I have nothing to show that I was.

                           However, several of the people have taken pity on me and have given me a helping hand,
                           and when I'm off duty I stay round and try to get some idea of what my next task may

                           Then the kitchen, too, I don't care to think about, because things are measured out
                           by French weights and divided or cut up into individual weights, which are sold for
                           French money, and that calculation will not be easy to attack. The other things are
                           not bad.

                           in the other, often trying to make change in between. Then if I have soup, it's the

                           we clap a plate of "repas;" meat, vegetable and hunk of bread. Then the men go to

                           last of the duties, only undertaken if there are enough workers, is to sell stationary

                           you look, there they are. It's a favorite place for attacks. They got fifteen hundred
                           bombs in four days in March, more than any other town in France. There is no roof
                           on the station, and near the house where I first went is the biggest bomb hole any
                           of the military men have ever seen. Châlons has been shelled too. I don't see how
                           the canteen workers have stood it. Every night for weeks they were carted out into
                           the country to sleep in the open air, and if it rained, they had to be packed together
                           under some kind of a shelter. Poilus tried their beds during the day, and they took
                           the consequences.

                           up. Colonials are good shock troops, but don't hold well, they say. (Two guns have

                           because someone is apt to tell us, and there is no mistaking the moment it does begin,
                           I can assure you. I think so often of Mother when I am coming back from supper and
                           the sky is red with flashes and the guns are roaring like distant thunder. They say

                           heavy dull booms which they said were German bombs. After the thing quieted down,
                           Mme. Hennocque asked if I would like to see the town "caves." No one at home can ever
                           have any conception of what I saw. It was 3.30. We went in through the court of the

                           passed through a stone gate built in the hillside and in a few seconds turned and
                           looked down an endless gallery lined on both sides with beds, put as close together
                           as possible, with little night lamps burning at intervals, giving just enough light
                           to keep the place from utter darkness. There were all kinds of beds, elaborate wooden
                           ones, iron ones large and small. Some people had no bedsteads, just mattresses on
                           the damp ground. Others were wrapped in blankets sitting up in folding chairs, and
                           still others, whom I took to be town paupers, were stretched out on top of great wine
                           vats, with no coverings whatever. All the beds were occupied by one or more persons,
                           all in different degrees of soundness of sleep and different degrees of loudness of
                           breathing, and all had placed beside them in a pile their most precious possessions;
                           the children their little toys, the women, great bundles of what I took to be household
                           linen. Some of them even had brought their choicest articles of furniture for safe
                           keeping. Mme. Hennocque took me up and down some of the galleries. We were not allowed

                           they had rats pattering around their beds. I put my hand on the walls. They were damp
                           and wet, simply dug out of the clay hills. The cellars are arranged in long connected

                           and trains. The railroad platforms—there are three long ones—change every five minutes.
                           Sometimes they are all blue, poilu blue, then olive green massed with Italian troops,
                           and again brown with our own khaki. Sometimes they are mixed, one platform of each
                           color, when the different troop trains happen in at the same time. Then there are
                           the trains with equipment, guns all camouflaged, big and little; box cars shut up
                           tight; whole lines of flat cars filled with baby tanks. Then, too, the sanitary trains
                           go through every little while, which are always met by one or two workers. I almost
                           pull my arms out "doing" these, carrying the heavy pitchers of coffee, handing them
                           up to the men nurses, and rushing back for more. The "infirmier" will tell you the
                           number of wounded he has, and you leave him coffee enough for all. The German "blessés"
                           get coffee, too, for the kindly old French "infirmiers" say, "Mlle., they are all
                           wounded, French and Boches alike." But when it comes to cigarettes it is a little
                           different. Sometimes we ask the French wounded whether or not to give them to the
                           Boches; sometimes we pass them by, which even now I don't like to do; and sometimes
                           they say, "Allemand," to us, and these are apt to get them as a reward for what may
                           be honesty, or perhaps is only haughtiness.

                           to the biggest of big guns; ambulances rushing to the front and back with the wounded;
                           camions full of different kinds of remarkable and strange things; officers flying
                           back and forth in fine cars covered with mud; a double line going and coming, with
                           no beginning and no end. Sometimes gay French artillery rattle by, horse drawn, and
                           for two or three days the procession coming this way was interrupted by a long, bluish
                           green line made up of young, weary looking German boys in rags, and so unadorned,
                           stripped as they were of all their equipment, that they seemed pathetic; footsore
                           too, as you could tell by one who had discarded his shoes altogether and was carrying
                           them around his neck. They were so young that the French exclaimed, “Why, Mlle., they
                           never have had any hair on their faces." (It's like a thunder storm here now; flashes
                           of lightning and a distant roar; Mother wouldn't like it. Some nights I can't sleep
                           it is so noisy, and everything in the room vibrates. They are going it full tilt,
                           just begun). Their escort, French soldiers who have been wounded and cannot be sent
                           back to the front, marched at regular intervals on each side of the line, some with
                           guns with bayonets fixed pointing straight ahead, some on horses with long medieval-like
                           lances carried straight up and down, and some with swords drawn and held at "attention."
                           All the population came out to watch. There were posters in shop windows to tell when
                           to expect them and the streets were filled with blue poilus and black civilians, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e930"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span>who for the most part watched in silence. They were all polite; only one woman whom
                           I saw became excited. She told one of the prisoners what they had made her suffer;
                           a man beside her stopped her, exclaiming, "You must not tell them that," and another
                           man near me grumbled out, "Ten thousand more good loaves of bread a day gone to the
                           devil."

                           I counted in less than ten minutes the other day. They come out of the sky like flocks
                           of wild ducks with their leader ahead and little scouts flying around and above them.
                           I find myself jumping up and down with excitement, as each new

                           German lines. Every fair day they go. I wonder how many come back. There is always
                           a buzz in the air. At about eleven every day lately a German comes over and takes
                           a look at us, and our

                        <p id="d47486e962">It is about 7.30 A.M. and I am sitting up in bed wrapped up in everything I own. Had
                           a compromise night last night; went to bed half dressed because I couldn't decide
                           whether to stay entirely clothed, or pretend that I was leading a calm life and go
                           to bed in regulation fashion. As the night was very bright and favorable to the enemy,
                           I made my plans for a possible midnight visit. Our own sausage balloons were up and
                           our gun mounted on an automobile, ready and waiting. They did not come, but at 5.30
                           I was waked by the guns, thundering out all along the line, and after I am once waked
                           up by them I can't sleep again. They stopped about 6.30 or 7, and now perfect calm
                           reigns for the time being, except for the rumble of the camions. I am off duty until
                           1 P.M. this week, so am not going to get up early, as I need the rest; I wish I could
                           make up lost sleep but I rather think that has gone for good, for I couldn't possibly
                           settle down to sleep in the day time. I tried one day and lost 10,000 Boches prisoners
                           by doing it. However, I'd seen a lot before. Every day, too, little groups go up and
                           down.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e965">Of course I have no perspective on the war at all. What is Russia doing? We don't
                           hear a thing about that. Mrs. Earle has gone to Digne and was a little dejected about
                           it, I think. I did my best to get her out of social into military service, for the
                           social service will go on as long as humanity lasts, and this war will, I hope, not
                           go on quite as indefinitely as that. We went to different Red Cross departments and
                           no place seemed to fit her exactly, so she took what they gave her. Think of it, she
                           speaks all the warring <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e967"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="66" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span>languages, even Flemish, and is put down in the south of France to take charge of
                           refugees, whom I imagine are sent back from the occupied country through Switzerland;
                           people undesirable for the Germans to hold and evidently undesirable for the French
                           to take back, for no township or department wants them. Politics enter in, too, and
                           the mayor who is smart enough to keep them out, or can arrange to have the smallest
                           number quartered in his district, is the popular man. I know that, because I went
                           to a lecture at the Red Cross given by the wife of a Sorbonne professor, who has studied
                           conditions in order to teach them to the refugee workers. It seems like a waste of
                           good material, doesn’t it?

                        <p id="d47486e970">I don't remember when I last wrote home and don't know whether or not you see the
                           letters I send. They are always written in such feverish haste that I'm afraid they
                           aren't worth seeing. Don't say the interesting letters must come from me. I'm in one
                           of the places with the strictest censorship. Even Mme. Hennocque's letters from her
                           husband, a famous cavalry general, are censored by military authorities before she
                           gets them.

                           fixed up by the Paris doctors. Two went yesterday, so we are short handed again during
                           this terrible rush. I told you in a postcard that nothing happened the night after
                           I wrote. It

                           at all, nor last night. Night before last (October 1st) we caught it three times,
                           our most war-like horror.

                           before the barrage began. After that it is not safe to venture out. I watched it a
                           little from the front door, saw the tracers go up and shrapnel explode. It's wonderful
                           to see, but the experienced people have words of contempt for any one who wants to
                           look, so I accepted their better judgment and went down to the cellar. Neither Miss
                           Pond nor Miss Coryn, old hands at it, seemed satisfied with our position, but we couldn't
                           help it. Forty-five had been killed by staying in a cellar like that, and they seem
                           to feel that we should be much criticised if we met a like fate. We stayed there,
                           however, while a terrific firing went on outside; 
                           <add id="d47486e989" hand="mh">"</add>seventy-fives,
                           <add id="d47486e992" hand="mh">"</add> machine guns and other guns, and we heard the German machines and the bombs they
                           dropped. Finally it calmed down and we thought things were over, so I went home and
                           was sitting on my bed later, writing a letter, when I heard the front door rattle
                           violently, a boom, boom, boom, and M.H. found herself on her feet with her hair standing
                           on end. The old woman downstairs, who had come back from the "caves," thinking the
                           excitement of the night over, screeched up to me to come down quickly, got me into
                           her room, shut the door, and wailed and moaned and kept crying out, "Oh, I'm so frightened,
                           why did I ever come home from the

                           outside there was the terrific explosion of shrapnel and bombs. You feel a little
                           helpless at such a time. I tried to calm her but couldn't. After a <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1002"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="68" data-tei-n="fp53"> </a></span>

                           in the house, a thing I didn't care any too much about, so I rushed up stairs, opened
                           my windows—I'd risk my life any time to save my window glass—grabbed my papers, my
                           money and steel helmet, put out my fire, and flew for the canteen. They were all down

                           and felt I'd explode of nervousness if I couldn't find some way in soon. It was like

                           bombs had fallen just across from our house. We went to see what had happened and
                           found that a bomb had fallen into the cinema room of the evacuation hospital, into
                           which the wounded men had been crowded that night, waiting to be evacuated. There
                           were ambulances all about and hushed excitement; no one would say a word except that
                           we couldn't help. In the darkness we could see poilus standing round tagged with big
                           white tickets, stretchers lying about, but I couldn't make out whether they were the
                           wounded from the front or the dead and dying from what the French insist on calling
                           the "accident."

                        <p id="d47486e1078">The next day Mme. Hennocque and I went over. My Red Cross admitted us, but when we
                           got to the door of the cinema, the doctor in charge said, "Mme. it is no sight for
                           a woman to see, nor for a man, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1080"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="55"> </a></span>either." This woman didn't want to see it.

                        <p id="d47486e1083">Two American officers came out and said they were glad they had been in, for now they

                           <add id="d47486e1088" hand="mh">"</add> I thought it had taken quite a while to make them so. The doctor said that in all
                           his four years' experience at the front he had never seen anything to equal that.
                           He had asked for permission to evacuate his hospital in the day time, and said he
                           would take no responsibility for the result if it were not done. He had had no answer,
                           only the result. They say he is almost crazy. If the Germans had come twenty minutes
                           later, the room would have been empty. I rather think it was the worst thing of the
                           kind that has happened at all. They say the news flew like wildfire over the front
                           and the men are fighting like mad for revenge.

                           for I was on duty at 4 A.M. and couldn't leave. Military headquarters has ordered
                           the canteen closed from 8 P.M. to 4 A.M., so I slept either down under ground or in

                           into Châlons, Mme. Hennocque and her daughter walked out, leaving everything behind,
                           and they've never had a moment's rest since. We even find food hard to get; no butter,
                           no eggs, no milk, chicken prohibitive in price, meat terribly tough.

                           sha'n't I? I've asked some of the others today what they do, and they say that on
                           clear nights they take off their skirts and boots and leave the rest on, and on stormy
                           nights they turn in. That is about the way I figured it out.

                           with my papers, etc., ready to grab to take with <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1194"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span>me when I make my midnight excursions. Sometimes I go with my steamer rug and sometimes
                           without it. My boots are always put where I can jump into them, and my fur coat arranged
                           so I can find the sleeves with no difficulty. There often is not much time between
                           the

                           After that we can't go out. My helmet seems to have taken the place of my life preserver.
                           I'd rather take my chances any day with a submarine, though, than with a bombing machine
                           in the air. They do such devilish things.

                           <p id="d47486e1218">Great bombardment all night. People couldn't sleep. My sleep disturbed, for when that
                              is going on you feel that something is wrong and you can't rest calmly. It is certainly
                              a nervous life. I don't take off my clothes at night now. Am eaten alive with fleas
                              and suffer untold agony. Scarcely have time to wash my hands or do my hair; am a perfect
                              pig to behold, but there is so much doing that I couldn't shut myself up for long
                              enough to do anything. Tried to fix my room. Shifts at the canteen have changed and
                              I am to go on at 4 AM so must sleep there tonight in the office on a cot. After supper
                              stayed a few minutes at the club, and the "
                              <ref id="d47486e1220">alerte</ref>" sounded. We did not move immediately as we thought it would be nothing, but the
                              guns began so we went to the cellar. The girls didn't like that as it was dangerous
                              and we are not supposed to. The thing didn't last long, just some Germans passing
                              over, I guess. Saw the sweetest procession go over the bridge today; a little circus
                              parade, each little cart drawn by a big sturdy horse. They were carrier pigeons going
                              up to the front in their little houses, which were very neat and freshly painted.
                              They had windows to look out and it was the only soothing thing I've seen in the long
                              endless moving stream. Later a French artillery detachment went along and seemed very
                              warlike, all camouflaged. Even the sanitary trains are camouflaged. I saw one with
                              all the windows broken yesterday, a perfect wreck. The guard told me the 
                              <ref id="d47486e1223">Boches</ref> had done it. Saw also about a hundred dogs going up to the front. They were walking
                              round the streets here, two to one master, looking <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1226"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="79" data-tei-n="60"> </a></span>awfully sweet and young, all different kinds, but so affectionate to their masters.
                              They had little tin boxes on their collars. I hated to think that they had to catch
                              it too.

                              4 and 7. No time to drink a cup of coffee before I began, so I got almost to a state
                              of fainting from exhaustion. Had to pour coffee and chocolate steadily without a moment
                              to find my handkerchief even, for three hours, lifting those heavy pitchers and rushing
                              madly about to keep all the

                              <ref id="d47486e1245">Miss Bennett</ref> had been doing the same thing from 11 P.M. on, without time even to take a drink
                              of coffee themselves—eight hours without one second off!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1249">From 7 to 8 the canteen is closed to be cleaned and the cook gave me a little breakfast.
                              At 8 I had to go into the "
                              <ref id="d47486e1251">caisse</ref>" to sell coffee, soup and chocolate checks, until 10.30. Thought I'd die of the responsibility.
                              It was as cold as Greenland and I had a chill. Was a wreck all day and tried to lie
                              down in the afternoon, and lost

                              from perfect calm and quiet, to a glare of light and continuous rumble of thunder.
                              It's wonderful the way it breaks out everywhere at once, even the house shakes. Sometimes
                              it begins at 10 P.M. Sometimes at 11, sometimes at 4 A.M., and occasionally through
                              the day. Always aviators overhead. Don't know whether they are enemy or not, and whether
                              or not we'll be <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1259"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="80" data-tei-n="61"> </a></span>bombed into Kingdom

                              lines. If I could only keep clean! But I can't and that's the end of it.

                              the hospital first to see what had happened. The platform outside the cinema room
                              was filled with the roughest kind of coffins just slung together, which poilus brought
                              up one by one as fast as they could, shovelled clean sand into the bottom, put them
                              just inside the door, collected (on stretchers) what they thought might belong together,
                              and nailed the lid on. Ordered a little wood for $13. 
                              <ref id="d47486e1286">Mme. Hennocque</ref> showed me 
                              <ref id="d47486e1289">rue Carnot</ref> and the terrible ruins there. Invited me to go to luncheon with them at the "Angleterre,"
                              which has been hit by a bomb and is more or less of a wreck. Interesting eating there
                              and good to get different food. Place full of officers of all sorts, very grand affairs,
                              with huge silver sunbursts on their bosoms, a mark of great honor, I'm told. Had to
                              rush back to service at one o'clock. Before I got home at 4.30 the wood had arrived,
                              so I made a fire and got a hot bath, which made me late for dinner, but felt like
                              a new woman. On the way to dinner, passed the procession going to the "caves." Some
                              have been doing it for years. All workers who could go were taken to the<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1292"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="81" data-tei-n="62"> </a></span> country for the night. I had to stay as I am on duty at 4 A.M.

                              in a hand basin. Was called at 3.30, got dressed, which means putting on my shoes
                              and shaking down like a dog. You're not here more than a day or two before you lose
                              all fastidious habits. Generally get my face washed after a fashion and teeth brushed.
                              Also managed to get a cup of coffee before I began work today. Poured chocolate and
                              coffee with one hand and took in the money as fast as I could with the other. It’s
                              about as hard work as I could do and keep it up. At 7 A.M. had to fix up my counter
                              and money boxes. Then ran home, washed my hands, fixed my hair, had coffee and bread,

                              on one side of the monument and we on the other. There were French nurses, Y.M.C.A.,
                              two or three English women ambulance drivers, besides the Red Cross. When 
                              <ref id="d47486e1339">General Gouraud</ref> and other important officers came in, the bugle sounded. There were two speeches.
                              Then the ecclesiastical party came in, the 
                              <ref id="d47486e1342">Bishop</ref>, the choir boys with candles, and they went through their part of the service. I
                              got another coughing fit and almost passed away again. Was mortified to death. At
                              the end the bugle sounded again as the General went out, and after him the Bishop.
                              The interment was later, done without ceremony, I believe.

                              with first dressings on. Some cars smelled dreadfully. We got coffee to them all.
                              Then we took cigarettes, climbed up into the cars, and handed two to each of the men
                              who wanted them. A few were too sick to take them and I'm afraid others were not able

                              had his jaw and teeth blown away, and had a silver plate for a jaw. His skin is drawn
                              so tight underneath that he says it makes him uncomfortable, but the jaw plate does
                              not hurt. Can't eat hard things. He is behind the lines for good now. Talks in a muffled

                              so watched at the station. Saw Pétain, Poincaré and Gouraud get into their cars. General
                              Gouraud stopped and spoke to Miss Porter. He is the great man of the moment, because

                              the station platform was filled with new stretchers, which shows what is expected.

                              she has been in too much of a hurry to get to her "cave" to do anything. They say
                              we have given ten thousand "repas" a day sometimes in the canteen. Town absolutely
                              given over to the "militaire." People who have horses and carts go to the country
                              every night, put straw in the bottom, and pile the whole family in on top of it. See
                              them starting out before dark. Always terrific bombardment going on at front, and
                              always camouflaged lines of camions passing. One lot had camouflage for roads, which
                              looked like rolls of grass, etc., like stage settings. Another was like a street cleaning
                              brigade, huge brushes like those used for that, each drawn by one horse, and behind
                              them carts filled with big, long, very long handled spades, shovels, etc. Often great
                              trucks full of American boys, grinning generally when they pass their country-women.

                              the stage yet where I'm used to the work. I don't have any of the hard cleaning or
                              cooking to do, but standing up for six hours steadily, pouring out coffee and chocolate,
                              or dishing out soup, or handing out "repas" or consigning "couverts" or sitting in
                              the "caisse" is wearing in the end, because of the impatience with which you are viewed

                              impatience, generally, but still you are aware something is expected of you which
                              you can't for the moment accomplish. Many of the poilus joke; some tap the counter
                              with their cups; some call out, "I've been here since yesterday morning," or some
                              other pleasantry. Some to attain their ends even try flattery, calling you pet names.
                              "En masse" they are certainly entertaining and loveable. One came up today and insisted
                              on shaking hands with a sister "Republican."

                              but much ground gained. The Germans have been pushed out of their concrete quarters
                              by the terrific bombardments which we've heard lately. We hear that "no prisoners"
                              are being taken now, an order from headquarters. It seems horrible, but everything
                              is horrible. Jeanne, our maid, has been crying all day because she has had a letter
                              from her brother, a prisoner in Germany, signed, "Your little brother who is starving."

                              to make a fire. Found my woodpile in such a mess that I fixed it all up, and just
                              as I started away, the whole thing fell down, so I spent another half hour building

                              such opportunities. I can't say I was overjoyed at the prospect because of my tendency

                              stay there longer than a few hours, but in reality many have to stay much longer,
                              because of lack of transportation and often because they are too badly wounded to
                              be moved immediately. As long as no one is supposed to stay, very little food is provided,
                              so the nurses in real distress came down to us to see if we couldn't send up food
                              and workers to make a little emergency canteen.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1622">When we arrived at the hospital we found nothing but the bare ground where the canteen
                              had been. The house was gone, not a trace of anything left. Finally Miss Coryn came
                              wandering up, glanced at me, and remarked, "Oh, you'll be colder than that yet." And
                              then told us that one of the ambulances had moved out a little while ago and as the
                              portable house used for our canteen belonged to them, they had taken it, but another
                              ambulance was going to give us a tent, as the "Medicin-Chef" wanted us to stay—in
                              a French field hospital there are several ambulances, each comprising five doctors,
                              their nurses, "infirmiers" and equipment. I stood shivering, first on one foot, then
                              on the other, while the men put up our tent. We thought we'd have only the muddy ground
                              for a floor, but by and by they took pity on us and brought some wooden slats, making
                              walks for us to <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1624"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="70"> </a></span>move and stand upon—a great comfort. Then they brought back our tables, benches, marmites
                              and boxes, put up our stove, and we were at it again, all in an hour's time.

                              <add id="d47486e1630" hand="mh">,</add> was to arrange our entrance so that no light could escape at night, and to fix the
                              camouflage for our oiled silk windows, so that the German aviators could not spot
                              us too easily. Such details were all so interesting to one new to the ways of war!

                           <p id="d47486e1634">After the camionette had gone, we heard a most terrific noise and rushed out. Everyone
                              was looking towards Châlons, where there was a great column of smoke rising like an
                              enormous geyser, an explosion of some sort. Miss Coryn began my instruction immediately,
                              and took me to visit the "grands blessés" wards. We gave the men grapes and cigarettes,
                              and it almost killed me to see the agony on some of their faces. Then she said she
                              would go to see two more patients in the next ward, but that I'd better not come.
                              I did, though, and the horror of that sight! A huge tent, scarcely lighted at all,
                              bare ground, empty except in the middle a little bit of a stove, with a little bit
                              of a fire burning in it, and near it two cots, on one a Frenchman, and on the other
                              an Arab. Their wounds were infected and they would have been too offensive to have
                              had in a ward with others, so they were left alone here to breathe out their lives
                              in as long a time or short a time as nature would allow.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d47486e1639">That night, feeling excessively out of place, I dined on awful food with the French
                              nurses—some ladies, some not—in the nurses' barrack<del id="d47486e1641" type="erase">s</del>, and heard that the explosion we'd seen in the afternoon was a camion filled with
                              hand grenades. After dinner they pulled out their cigarettes, had a sociable smoke,
                              and then went back to their quarters, and Miss Coryn and I spent the night in luxury
                              on stretchers in an officer's room, where there are electric lights, running water,
                              and a stove with enough fire in it to make the room really warm. The only out was
                              <add id="d47486e1644" hand="mh">,</add> that it is next to the "triage," the great receiving ward for the patients, where
                              they are sorted out, and all night long stretcher bearers were walking back and forth
                              past our door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1648">In the morning I was waked up by a cheerful voice calling through the wall, "Did les
                              dames Americaines sleep well?" And soon after one of the "infirmiers" announced to
                              the "Medicin-Chef" the number of deaths that night, nine.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1651">While the canteen was in the little house, the girls had had to sleep on stretchers
                              on the floor, a rather uncomfortable thing to do, as all the men who used the place
                              were "petits malades," all with grippe or influenza, and all with habits so untidy
                              that the floor must have been soaked with germs by the millions. I am glad to have
                              escaped that. When the tent was put up, it occurred to the French mind that it would
                              be thoroughly improper for two women to sleep in that, so other quarters were provided
                              in the barracks, with <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1653"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="96" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span>our one or two nights of luxury in between.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1657">After a breakfast with the nurses, who in the lamp light the night before were charmingly
                              pretty, but in their half-dressed early morning untidiness were less attractive, my
                              duties began. I piled a big tray full of delicious grapes, and was told to go to certain
                              "malades" wards while Miss Coryn took the "blessés." When I reached the wards, I found
                              the "Medicin-Chef" making his visits. I had read in Red Cross directions never to
                              go into a ward while the doctors are there, so I stood outside under the canopy which
                              connects the long row of tents, where the very sick patients are. They are great long
                              white tents, with sheets hanging between every two cots, for the "malades" don't like
                              to see each other die; it depresses them. The "blessés" don't mind, so they die before
                              the whole ward.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47486e1660">It seemed as though the doctor spent hours in that ward. I watched the old "infirmiers"
                              clean up the dreadful receptacles which they brought out of the tents, pouring their
                              contents on to the ground. I didn't see how any of us could escape the disease when
                              such methods were used, but I supposed it was the best they could do. Then I watched
                              the stretcher bearers, carrying their great piles of used linen away from the wards,
                              and occasionally some carrying off stretchers filled with old, worn out, dirty uniforms,
                              a very depressing sight. And then I watched a young aviator flying over the hospital,
                              a cousin of one of the doctors, who came to give us a little treat. It was the most
                              wonderful flying I have ever seen,—loop the loops, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1662"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="97" data-tei-n="fp73"> </a></span>

                              me afterwards that he had never seen anyone do such reckless things. Finally the doctor
                              came out and I began my visits, and I can assure you I saw that frightful disease
                              in every one of its frightful stages. The minute I approached a cot, a terrible fit
                              of coughing would take place. It never failed, and I walked into whirlwinds of deadly
                              germs of every variety. A few, a very few, were able to give me a faint smile of thanks.
                              Some nodded their heads only, and as I passed some

                              the men.

                              in our little "foyer."

                              Red Cross sign made for us and put on the <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1746"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="101" data-tei-n="75"> </a></span>door, but when we went to it that night we found it occupied by two women already
                              in bed, who said it had been given to them, so we had to go back and get Lambert,

                              belongings, and hunt up the "Medicin-Chef," who put us back into our first quarters.

                              sign on the door, and said that would be our quarters. There were two cots in it,
                              nothing else. My wash basin, which luckily I had brought from U.S.A., had to be placed
                              on the floor, and we knelt to wash our faces. There was no camouflage for the window,
                              so Miss Coryn nailed her blanket across that. I should never have thought of it, but
                              she is well trained in war ways.

                              nice, who do their work well, I'm told. They come to the canteen in Châlons for food
                              sometimes and one has just stopped here to get warm. She said there are crowds of
                              Japanese convoys on the road today.

                              Today an escadrille flew by, blowing their <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1777"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="102" data-tei-n="76"> </a></span>sirens, and such a weird noise as it was, like a flock of huge wild geese, quacking
                              the way they do when they fly over us at Cohasset going south in the fall; only this
                              was a wail, bloodthirsty and bloodcurdling.

                           <p id="d47486e1781">An American boy, a patient, who drives a French ambulance, comes into the canteen
                              often. He gave me a shoulder strap off one of the first German prisoners taken in
                              the Champagne drive. Two German prisoners come occasionally, also. We give them coffee
                              and a piece of bread, but if they linger too long, we show them the door, because
                              we can't have them taking the seats of the French boys. One is an unattractive sort
                              of a man, the other rather a nice young boy, who speaks French and with whom the poilus
                              seem to enjoy talking. I am sorry I can't hear what he says, for the conversations
                              look interesting. He was in the trenches one day and taken prisoner the next; that
                              was his war experience.

                           <p id="d47486e1784">We talk to the poilus and hear interesting tales. A sweet little aviator comes in,
                              one who has just become a pilot and is waiting to be placed in some escadrille. He
                              has been brought up by an English nurse and speaks so well and is such a gentleman
                              that it is a pleasure to have him come. He was a "petit malade" and ready to go soon.
                              He's not strong, though, and I know war will not be good for him.

                              animals; how they hunt ostriches with dogs, etc.

                              in often for English lessons. The doctor is so eager to learn that it is quite funny.
                              Indeed, they sometimes come too often; I think they find their young teacher, Miss
                              Coryn, too attractive to leave alone.

                              raincoat into the sick wards and take it off for the wounded, not to carry infection.
                              We were promised a hot bath in a bathtub this afternoon, but it never came off; the
                              bath orderly has grippe.

                              but not many. Two poilus have just been talking together and I've been listening to
                              their conversation,—an older poilu and a young chasseur. The older one had been with
                              the division which had liberated the town where the younger one lived, they discovered,
                              and the boy was trying to find out whether his home was still standing. Finally in
                              the course of the discussion the young one complained that it was hard not to know
                              whether he had a home or not. "Hard! You don't know what hard is. I have not seen
                              my wife or daughter for four years. They are with the Boches. My home is gone, my
                              town is gone, and everything else is gone. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1803"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="fp78"> </a></span>

                              faintest look of hope in his face; nothing but impatience and suffering.

                           <p id="d47486e1826">Ten or twelve die every night. Each morning at breakfast the nurses announce the number
                              of deaths. Whenever a strong, heavy man is brought in, they always say, "Only a question
                              of hours for him." Sometimes I watch them unload the ambulances. Those able to walk
                              are made to do it; the others, the "couchés," are taken in on their stretchers, covered
                              with their big coats, and all their possessions piled on top of them. You can generally
                              tell from their looks how it will go with them. Sometimes, too, I watch the evacuations
                              for a while. They take hours. Only the most severely wounded are kept here. One day
                              for three hours a steady line of stretcher bearers went back and forth from the wards
                              to the sanitary train at the hospital station. Today, also, everyone was evacuated
                              who could be moved at all. Soon we may be evacuated, too. It is rumored the ambulance
                              which owns our tent is ordered off.

                           <p id="d47486e1832">I was interrupted by two men who appeared and told us they had orders to take the
                              tent down. When we expressed surprise, they said, "Why, haven't you been told we are
                              to go and must have our tent immediately?" So off they took it, and left us homeless
                              for a second time. We were put into one of those horrible great newly evacuated <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1834"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span>pest houses beside us, where night after night we had listened to the coughing and
                              the groans of exhaustion and discouragement of two hundred poilus resting on two hundred
                              cots with only boards for springs, until we thought we'd go mad. It was too awful
                              for words. I couldn't even sit down there, so Miss Coryn and I packed up our most
                              valued possessions, cigarettes, and went out to take a walk.

                           <p id="d47486e1837">The sense of freedom I felt when I passed those hospital gates was very strange. Fresh
                              air to breathe, beautiful fields all about us, no coughing, no disinfectant, no hammering
                              in of nails, nothing but beautiful country with a beautiful sunset in the sky, and
                              a heavenly, picturesque little village near by, where troops and their horses were
                              quartered "en repos" in every corner and shelter it possessed, and wherever you looked
                              you found a Belasco stage setting with a fascinating group of poilus cooking their
                              evening meal over their fires, lighted by twilight outside or by candle light inside.
                              It was a wonderful picture and it is hard to realize the fearful tragedy of it even
                              while living in it.

                           <p id="d47486e1840">That night we sat over a tiny stove in that huge tent and felt too dismal to speak.
                              Miss Coryn had a slight "cafard," (poilu for an attack of the blues). There was a
                              bright moon and about midnight I was waked up by aeroplanes going over the hospital,
                              flying very low. Everyone was walking round and talking and I couldn't make out whether
                              they were French or German "avions." <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e1842"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="107" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span>The hospital had been bombed and swept by machine guns and I must confess to a near
                              attack of knee-shaking for a while. It's a most peculiar feeling to have no shelter
                              to go to. If they were Boches they kept their bombs for another place that night.
                              They stayed round for an hour or so and then went off.

                              I talked to a nice, red-haired American boy from Texas for a while, and gave him some
                              of the "Camels" which Phil had stuffed into my pocket on the dock in New York. He
                              looked so delighted
                              <add id="d47486e1848" hand="mh">,</add> and asked me how I knew they were the only kind of cigarettes he smoked. I think
                              he must feel lonely there, all surrounded by French, but he said they have a sign
                              language which they understand very well. He had had his leg amputated, and looked

                              was one poor man who never changed; he was suffering frightfully; both his hands and
                              arms bandaged up, one leg off, and it was doubtful whether the other could be saved.
                              He looked like death as he sat propped up in bed, always in the same position, always
                              with the same expression of intense suffering on his face.

                              didn't go in. The last thing I heard was the American boy screaming, "Don't pull that

                        <p id="d47486e2078">The "avions" have been rushing past all the afternoon (the 28th) and flying so low
                           that they made an awful noise. Just before midnight word came to the canteen that
                           Austria wants a separate peace. There was great rejoicing. Everybody told everybody
                           else the news.

                        <p id="d47486e2081">Each day brings some phase of war new to me. The canteen is always packed and we work
                           like mad to feed the boys and to send them up to the lines as comfortable as possible.
                           Every time I hand out a hot dinner, I feel it may be the last the boy will ever have.
                           You will get some idea of the crowds we shelter when I tell you that one morning I
                           asked an American boy if he had found a place to sleep that night. "Oh, yes," he said,
                           "at three o'clock a Frenchman got up off the floor and I took his place." They are
                           on the tables, under the tables, and balanced on the cross bars that support the tables;
                           every chair is full, every bench crowded; those who cannot find enough floor space
                           to lie upon are propped up against the wall, goodness only knows how. The dormitory,
                           large cinema room, "salle de lecture," the restaurant, and a long corridor where they
                           check their belongings, are all the same, and some have to sleep out of doors. It's
                           awfully cold!

                        <p id="d47486e2106">Our nights have not been comfortable. We hear that the "Richthofen circus," the best
                           German flying squadron, has been moved down opposite us, and there are frequent "alertes"—all
                           electric lights in the canteen go out, and we have to clear it by candle light, snatch
                           up our money boxes and fly to the "abri," after making sure not a poilu is left above
                           ground. Telephone messages come, "Germans at Epernay, expect them in twenty minutes,"
                           etc., and sometimes they come and sometimes they don't. Then we have the reports from
                           the front, only two hours old often; reports of frightful slaughter going on there,
                           of the awful sacrifices we are making to take the Argonne, and the terrible fighting
                           near Verdun. We can hear the roar of the guns day and night. The military and troop
                           trains go up and the wounded trains come down, and we always have platform work to
                           do outside, besides the canteen work inside, and nurses who are rushing from one sector
                           to another, to feed in the office.

                        <p id="d47486e2109">My one spree was a day when I was on night duty. Miss Coryn and I packed up a luncheon,
                           took a chance at getting out past the guards, and went to L'Épine, to see the wonderful
                           church, with fascinating gargoyles, one of the most interesting small ones in France.
                           It was a whole day of freedom, beautiful sunshine, warm green fields, and country
                           that seemed lovely, but isn't really very pretty. We were given a lift by American
                           officers, who dropped us at the church and said they were going back again in the
                           afternoon and would take us home. We ate our luncheon in a field where we could see
                           the church <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2111"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="116" data-tei-n="fp86"> </a></span>

                           with the world. It is strange how quiet and peaceful you can feel with such things
                           going on all about. I suppose it was seeing the country and breathing the country
                           and being away from the constantly changing mob at the canteen that was calming to
                           our nerves.

                        <p id="d47486e2123">The church is a beauty. If you are ever in this part of France you must see it. In
                           the thirteenth century the Virgin appeared to the people and bade them build a church
                           over a spring on that spot. There are two or three German graves in the churchyard.
                           We explored the trenches behind the church, where the people go during raids, I suppose.
                           The town has been bombarded and somewhat destroyed, but the church escaped, one of
                           the few which have in this part of the land.

                           and mustard brown puttees and hats, which give a good bit of color, are always working
                           at the station.

                           window for the same purpose, and one to put on the floor for my feet, also one over
                           my bed. That's all a wild dream of luxury, which I sha'n't have, of course. I just

                           hear the organ at the end of Mass. We had just heard of Turkey and hopes of peace,
                           and France triumphant was in the heart of the organist. He never could have played
                           like that six months ago. I could scarcely keep my self control. It's too much to
                           grasp. Not one soul in the whole world who has not had to suffer! We are used to it
                           now. Peace we are not used to, and the emotion of having the agony over will almost
                           kill some people.

                           almost all covered with beautiful growing crysanthemums. Many of the French crosses
                           were decorated with those bead flower wreaths, sometimes with the boy's name on them
                           and "Regrets" written under it in big bead letters.

                           white with black hieroglyphics. Our graves had no flowers. I thought they would be
                           cared for as they were in Paris, so did not think of carrying any for them, and it
                           was too late to get them then. On each was a little green plant something like parsley.

                           in all the niches above the altar, and in front of it was a large catafalque draped
                           in a flag and surrounded by many candles. Three beautiful French flags brought in
                           by the procession were held over the catafalque. The service was solemn and impressive.
                           The body of the church was filled with "militaires," officers and soldiers, French
                           and American. On the side aisles were the civilians, women draped in crêpe, men in
                           the blackest of black clothes. "May peace be with the dead, and after the war may
                           peace be also with us," so preached the Bishop. He, as many others, is evidently much
                           worried about the condition of France after the war, and he besought his people to
                           preserve "social and religious peace",—otherwise the sacrifice they had so splendidly
                           made during the four years of war would have been made in vain.

                           the end so imminent. Now we are just waiting to see what Austria will do.

                        <p id="d47486e2189">Two little bits of poilus, very gay ones, were in the canteen tonight, and led a lot
                           of singing. After a while they came over to the counter and sang to each other there.
                           Their "camarade" told me they were brothers and suggested that I ask for Tosca, which
                           I did, but they said they weren't in the mood for that, so their "camarade" told me
                           confidentially that they had had a little too much "pinar." He didn't have to be so
                           confidential, though. They sang snatches of <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2191"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="89"> </a></span>operas, with their good trained voices, acted to each other, and were quite amusing.

                        <p id="d47486e2194">I was so surprised to see Elizabeth White walk into the canteen office one day. I
                           showed her around the canteen and the town. We bought some "Madeleines" which we ate
                           on the street; they are the only things we can get with sugar in them. She is at the
                           French military hospital here, to take care of the American boys.

                        <p id="d47486e2197">Coming over from supper I saw a torch fall through the air, which an aviator in distress
                           had thrown out. He was too far away for us to find and it was so dark we could not
                           see him, only the torch which was like a Roman candle.

                        <p id="d47486e2200">I took my fur coat to be fixed today, and the woman who mended it told me how the
                           Germans had been quartered all over Châlons, in 1914, and how none of the French people
                           left their houses for eight days. At the end, the officer who was quartered in her
                           place went away in such a hurry that he forgot his fine embroidered linen, which was
                           being washed.

                        <p id="d47486e2203">The canteen certainly is amusing. Today there were crowds of Algerians in their khaki
                           and red fezzes, and a great many Poles who could only communicate with me in German,
                           and some grinning, friendly Chinese whom our boys jollied up to the amusement of all
                           hands. The poilus have a charm that never will

                           were fine fighters. I think the African had complained that they were put too much
                           into the front lines. They are used for attacks and the Germans don't like to see
                           them. The French soldier said he adored Americans, thinks them brave, generous and
                           fine to come to a strange country—not their own—to help and that the great victory
                           that is being won is due to them.

                           up that we couldn't see them. A poilu walked off with it, I am afraid to make a late
                           supper for himself. I hope he won't, though, as it was quite sweet.

                        <p id="d47486e2242">I went up to Corbineau Hospital with Mme. Oblin to see some of the boys. In one ward
                           which we were going to omit there was a black, black Senegalese with white, white
                           teeth, in bed. He grinned at me so invitingly that I had to go in and talk to him.
                           We had a nice little conversation and I received a fine salute when I left. They all
                           adore to see people, it breaks the monotony for a moment. When I got back I saw Miss
                           Bennett going out to do troop trains and asked if she wanted help. Two or three trains
                           were in, so we had lively business. Some of the men had made little shelters on the
                           flat cars under their guns and camions, with straw to lie upon and canvas for sides.
                           They were very comfortable, but crawled out of their holes for coffee, which is generally
                           much approved of by the poilus, who address us with polite little words of endearment,
                           "petite dame," etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2245">All of a sudden another train pulled in. The poilus were all shouting and calling
                           out to us in great excitement, "Est-ce la paix, Mlle. est-ce la paix?" The air was
                           electrified. They shrieked and yelled back and forth from one train to another, cheered,
                           shouted "la guerre est finie," "c'est la paix," waved their hands and their hats,
                           and I thought they had all lost their minds, but when I went back to the canteen it
                           was empty, not one single poilu there. They had all gone home! It was peace; they
                           had gone home, and that was all there was about it; so it seemed to me, and it was
                           the strangest sensation I ever had. Never before had I seen the canteen empty.

                        <p id="d47486e2250">I had always thought the war might end suddenly, but not quite as suddenly as this.
                           I knew that the Germans were in flight; that the French had had to follow them in
                           camions and automobiles in this part of the country, but we did not expect the end
                           quite so soon, and it has come too soon. A few days more and the whole German army
                           in this section would have been taken.

                        <p id="d47486e2254">I knew, too, that French hearts were lighter, for some Americans had told me a few
                           days before that the poilus had come out of the trenches singing, and I had heard
                           the organist at Notre Dame play his organ that day Turkey capitulated. There was victory
                           in his touch, every note rang out victory.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2257">Soon the poilus began to straggle back to the canteen. There was a general expression
                           of pleasantness on their faces, but no great excitement. No one knew just what to
                           believe, but we all felt that something was about to happen, even if it hadn't; and
                           then we learned that hostilities in one part of the line were to cease while the Germans
                           came through to ask for an armistice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2260">Of course we all waited with great impatience for eleven o'clock on November 11th.
                           Some of the men said they could not even wait two hours, "two hours more of war was
                           insufferable," they said, with a smile, and yet this ending is not satisfactory to
                           the great majority of people. They wanted Germany to know a few of the things about
                           war that they knew.

                           and I had to stay in the canteen, so that I never heard a church bell or a single
                           thing except one cannon! When that went off at eleven o'clock, all the soldiers cried
                           out, "C'est la paix! C'est la paix!" "La Guerre est finie!"—and continued to eat their
                           "repas complets!" No throwing up of hats, no singing of the Marseillaise; 
                           <hi id="d47486e2291" style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing</hi>. France is too sad, and the price it has had to pay is too great to have any real
                           demonstration of joy. There 
                           <hi id="d47486e2294" style="text-decoration: underline;" n="mh">is</hi> no joy here. It is simply an awful relief to have the slaughter stopped. That is
                           all. They all felt more like crying than celebrating, and I think that most of them
                           did. One of the French women in the canteen said she could not be gay it was such
                           a sad peace. "Look at the poilus; they are not rejoicing, they have lost too many
                           of their families and friends to be lighthearted." And it is perfectly true. When
                           I went out at one o'clock, there were a few flags about, but when I came home after
                           luncheon, the city was hung with them, and when I started out on my tour of the town,
                           all alone, (with my little silk American flag) so I should not have to control my
                           emotion too much, I hardly knew Châlons. There were flags from every window, the Hotel

                           flags, camions flying through the town full of shouting poilus, waving French and
                           American flags; American trucks so covered with flags that you could <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2300"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="128" data-tei-n="fp94"> </a></span>

                        <p id="d47486e2315">It was hard not to feel a little emotional at times, but I took to the side streets
                           always until I recovered. In the town square an old man caught hold of my flag and
                           kissed it, saying, with tears in his eyes, "C'est ça que j'aime." They were all wonderful
                           about the Americans. They give us full credit for the victory. Not one man I have
                           ever spoken to has belittled our part in any way. They always say, "Thanks to you
                           Americans." And that night at the canteen they showered so many attentions on one
                           poor American boy that he almost died of embarrassment. Wherever he walked he was
                           surrounded by an admiring mob. They kissed him first on one cheek and then on the
                           other; they formed circles round him; patted him, shook hands and fêted him until
                           he had to seek refuge somewhere out in the dark. His embarrassment was quite attractive
                           to watch, he was so nice and modest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2318">On my way home I stopped at the Hotel de Ville to watch the camions go by, and to
                           look at the flags and people, especially the American officers who had come in flocks
                           from the camps about to get a supply of champagne for their celebration that night.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2322">That evening I walked back to the canteen in electric light! Two lamps had been strung
                           across the main street, one at one end and one at the other,—the first time in four
                           years that a ray of light had ever penetrated the darkness of this town, and the first
                           time since I left home that I had seen one ray of light anywhere at night. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2324"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="130" data-tei-n="95"> </a></span> It was a wonderful sight and wonderful to see the people gazing at it as though they
                           had never seen one before. There were posters on the Hotel de Ville, saying that owing
                           to the armistice the order forbidding lights had been repealed, so the few shops which
                           were inhabited
                           <add id="d47486e2326" hand="mh">,</add> left their windows open, and it was a real celebration externally, but not internally.
                           The people weren't really gay; there was no spontaneity to speak of. A little singing
                           in cafés only. The noise was made by small boys. The star shells and tracers used
                           for fireworks that evening were fired off by small boys. The others had suffered too
                           much and victory had cost them too much, to be lighthearted.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2330">That evening there was a concert at the canteen, a calm one, but after it, a poilu
                           started to play the "Marseillaise" on an accordion; another grabbed a big French flag
                           and waved it, and the crowd joined in and sang. It was the only really spontaneous
                           celebration that I saw, and it was great, as it rang out through that big room and
                           made the cold shivers go up and down your back. The place quieted down almost immediately,
                           and after that they would only come up to you and say, "La guerre est finie, Mlle."
                           "On les a." (We have them). Men were in the canteen from Méziéres and said that the
                           guns did not stop until the dot of eleven; that before the end the Germans sent a
                           most terrific barrage of gas shells into the town and killed a great many civilians,
                           men, women and children, as well as soldiers. How dreadful for the ones who had to
                           be killed in those last few hours! That is about all I can tell you of the peace celebration
                           in Châlons. It was <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2332"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="96"> </a></span>not much like America, I imagine. Here there is always the black background of mourning,
                           and if a little feeling of lightness and cheer creeps into your soul, it is quickly
                           driven out by the tragedy all about.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2335">I'll never forget the impression I got on the rue de Marne that day of the armistice.
                           Flags were all out, the sidewalks crowded with the gaily dressed "militaire," camions
                           flying by all flag bedecked and full of cheering soldiers, when suddenly two young
                           women swathed in crêpe from head to foot stepped out of the crowd like black ghosts.
                           They were gone in a minute, but the impression that they left will never go. It was
                           the great dramatic touch, the real France which showed itself for a moment and then
                           disappeared.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2338">The next thrill I had was a trip to Rheims the day after the armistice. About ten
                           of us piled into a big camion and were sent over. Very soon after we left Châlons
                           evidences of war began to appear. Big camps along the side of the road where troops
                           and horses put up for the night; the huge war hospital at La Veuve, the most God-forsaken
                           place I've ever seen, the evacuation hospital for thousands of wounded in this section,
                           and a little farther on, the camouflaged roads began. From there on, all the way to
                           Rheims, we were travelling beside the camouflage. It was not hung over the roads here,
                           but a great screen on the German side, sometimes made of branches, sometimes bunches
                           of straw or raffia tied on wire screens, and sometimes regular made camouflage, a
                           wall ten feet high, I should say, so that the German balloon <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2340"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="132" data-tei-n="97"> </a></span>observers could not see the traffic on the road—unbroken except where the

                           </choice> of farms and little villages took its place. The roads which ran off from ours were
                           camouflaged, too, but they were screened on both sides, and it was a wonderful sight
                           to see lines of blue poilus with their shining steel helmets winding through these
                           screened roads. Soon we began to see shell holes in the fields, and places in the
                           road which had been repaired. Once in a while there was a camion, standing upside
                           down in a terrible state of wreckage in the gutter, and sometimes dead horses. Next
                           the tops of the trees seemed to have disappeared, and then the trenches (the Gouraud
                           line of defense) with barbed wires entanglements in front, began to appear. Trenches
                           seemed to go in every direction through the fields, with long things that looked like
                           clothes horses made of iron and all covered with barbed wire, lying near them, which
                           we were told were to be used by a retreating army. The last men to leave must pull
                           them down to impede the forward rush of the enemy. The woods were full of dugouts
                           and 
                           <add id="d47486e2348" hand="mh">"</add>abris.
                           <add id="d47486e2351" hand="mh">"</add> Little niches were cut out in the banks along the roadside, where men could take
                           shelter if the road were bombed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2355">We went through little villages all shot to pieces, with not one house standing which
                           was inhabited or inhabitable. Some were all down, some had great shell holes through
                           them, and some of the stone walls had little holes through them, too, made by the
                           French to shoot through if the enemy should pass by that way.

                        <p id="d47486e2372">The nearer Rheims we got the more battered up things were. Nothing but stumps were
                           left of the trees. The little village graveyards, or rather what was left of them,
                           were full of soldiers' crosses. I tried to take a picture from the back of the camion
                           of a regiment of poilus we passed on the road. They were led by their band and had
                           their flags and whole fighting equipment with them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2375">Rheims was a dead city. The silence was appalling, not a civilian in the place. Occasionally—only
                           occasionally, though—a soldier of some nationality would straggle by. They say there
                           are only eighteen houses intact in the place. That must mean absolutely without a
                           crack, for of course there are many streets with the houses standing, but damaged
                           to a greater or lesser degree. The nearer we got to the centre of the city, the more
                           battered it became, and finally when we turned into a side street, the cathedral appeared
                           in front of us. France triumphant rising out of her ruins! The French pennant was
                           flying from one of the spires out into the sunshine against the blue sky
                           <add id="d47486e2377" hand="mh">,</add> and an exquisite little group of French flags was arranged under the rose window,
                           as exquisite and delicate as the rest of the cathedral. That was all. It was almost
                           the only color we saw in Rheims that day. Perhaps there were four other flags hanging
                           from windows in the midst of the ruins, but they only emphasized the loneliness and
                           desolation of the place.

                           foot on the outside which has not been hit, and most of the detail is destroyed. The
                           inside was more or less cleaned up, at least the débris was collected into big piles.
                           There were enormous holes in the roof, through which flocks of birds were flying in
                           and out. The valuable glass windows were practically saved, and are in Paris now,
                           but the souvenir hunters, always expectant, still spend their precious moments in

                           the visitors before them might have overlooked a splinter of pigeon blood red or sapphire
                           blue glass from the old rose window.

                           mountains of débris that even entering them is impossible. It would be easier to begin
                           a new city than to try to reconstruct that, I should think. There are such queer freaks,
                           too. I looked up at what was once an inside wall of a house, and saw three rows of
                           saucepans hanging exactly as they were left on the wall when the people walked out;
                           nothing remained of the house but that wall and the saucepans. All the doors are open
                           and loot is plenty for anyone who feels like taking advantage of an opportunity like
                           that. <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2407"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="100"> </a></span>I did not go into any of the handsome houses but was told there were beautiful vellum
                           bound books, wonderful pieces of embroidery and laces, lying round, things which the
                           soldiers of the Allies did not think it worth while to take, and which I hope the
                           women in our party at least had common decency enough to let alone. I know some of
                           them went back several times, with longing in their hearts, to look at certain things,
                           but the result of their visits I never heard.

                        <p id="d47486e2410">One of the French women who works in the canteen here, the wife of the Rabbi of Rheims,
                           an adorable little person, stayed there all through the German occupation. During
                           the day she was made to nurse German wounded and at night she took care of eight French
                           wounded she had hidden in her cellar. "If the Boches had discovered it, I should have
                           been stood up against the wall," she answered when I questioned her about it. "Tant
                           pis." They have lost many things. Among them a wonderful collection of medieval books
                           beautifully bound, priceless I imagine, but she only says, "What difference does it
                           make, we have France." She had nursed and nursed and nursed under shell fire until
                           she couldn't do it any longer, and when ordered away from Rheims finally, she came
                           here for a change of occupation. If any woman ever deserved the Croix de Guerre, it
                           is she, but the ones who really deserve it, by their steady and untiring devotion,
                           are not the ones who always get it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2413">While we were wandering around the streets, a mounted French officer came clattering
                           up behind us. He wanted to know if we had met anyone <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2415"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="138" data-tei-n="101"> </a></span>walking about near by. I think the noise of his horse's hoofs as he galloped off must
                           have resounded through every part of the city. Such silence is uncanny.

                        <p id="d47486e2418">After we had seen about all we could in a short time, and I had taken a few pictures,
                           I asked our French soldier if we couldn't go out to see the German lines. "No, quite
                           impossible—défendu"—and we would get smashed up going home in the camion after dark.
                           I didn't like to say much else, but a little later I remarked that we were going to
                           have a bright moonlight night, and when we started for home I noticed that we didn't
                           start back in quite the direction we came in. Finally someone spoke of it and he said
                           no, we were going in quite the opposite direction, out to see Fort Brimont, the one
                           from which the Germans shelled Rheims for so many months.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2421">It seemed as though we had scarcely left Rheims when we stopped to get out to see
                           a big German tank mired on the side of the road, in perfect condition, with a big
                           iron cross painted on each side. Then we went on through the battlefield of years,
                           flat barren country, nothing but desolation, nothing growing, trenches, barbed wire,
                           shell holes, all mixed up together for miles and miles; shell holes so close that
                           you could not distinguish one from another. We passed a big German prison camp (I
                           imagine the prisoners were to clean up the country), and then a procession of baby
                           tanks on its way towards Rheims, the discipline of which we broke up slightly by tossing
                           their drivers cigarettes. It was hard to distinguish between the German and French
                           trenches, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2423"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="139" data-tei-n="fp102"> </a></span>

                        <p id="d47486e2442">Fort Brimont is a low hill, not far away. Just as we got there some French officers
                           appeared most inopportunely on the road, and our guide, whose respect for a man in
                           officer's cap is unfailing,—like all the French soldiers—seemed to grow visibly pale,
                           remarked that we had no permission to be there at all, and that we absolutely must
                           not get out, so we drove on past the fort. All that we could see was a shelled up
                           mound of earth. When we turned round to come back, we noticed all the road signs around
                           the fort were in German, and as they were the first I had seen they seemed very exciting.

                        <p id="d47486e2446">Of course Rheims is a wonderful and horrible sight, but the little villages are to
                           me the really pathetic ones. Rheims is big and rich, and you feel that the people
                           may have a little something besides what you see there, but in the little villages
                           you know you are looking on everything they have left in the world—a pile of débris.
                           If any rooms were left standing, their contents have been removed long since by the
                           French soldiers, who did the plundering so that the Germans might not have that pleasure
                           too!

                        <p id="d47486e2449">Coming home we passed artillery regiments drawn by horses. It was interesting to watch
                           them moving along in the gorgeous sunset, with their field kitchens cooking their
                           "soup" and coffee, leaving trails of hot cinders along the road, and to see them turn
                           in and wind their way through the camps, hundreds of them, until it seemed as though
                           the places could take no more. This was war on the country road, which I <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2451"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="141" data-tei-n="103"> </a></span>had not seen before.

                           were all together giving a concert and the poilus were standing around listening.
                           My "filleul" brought me a German bayonet and a "Gott mit uns" buckle, and his friend
                           gave me a "bidon."

                           a day or two prisoners began to straggle in, one or two at a time at first, and then
                           more and more and more, until we had to cry for help. We were swamped literally and
                           absolutely, and the town had to come to the rescue and provide some way to care for
                           them; feed, clothe and give them medical aid.

                        <p id="d47486e2471">It was on the 17th that the great influx began. That was a terrific day. At eight,
                           when we opened the canteen, we were flooded with them. It was the big day of celebration
                           in Paris. I had had a sneaking desire to go down to see it. Some went, but thank Heavens,
                           I didn't, for that was a day I know I really did help.

                        <p id="d47486e2474">Of all the wrecks I've seen here, these prisoners were the worst—human wrecks. No
                           one who has ever seen their faces could ever forget them, and no one who has not could
                           ever be made to know what they were like that cold morning, as they stood over the
                           counter waiting <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2476"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="142" data-tei-n="104"> </a></span>to be fed. They came by the hundreds, starved men, scarcely human; cold, emaciated,
                           coughing, many with suspiciously bright spots on their cheeks, unshaven, filthy, smelly,
                           with big, dark eyes that seemed to see nothing, faces that expressed nothing, hands
                           cold and clammy. They all felt the same, those hands, as they grabbed the bread I
                           offered them. Each time I had to turn round to fill my pitcher, I was thankful, for
                           it gave me an opportunity to try to control my face. The agony of a "blessé" train
                           is nothing to this, for their agony is quick and sharp, and this has been a slow death
                           of starvation and exhaustion. I'm sure many will not live much longer. There was generally
                           no change of expression when you spoke to them, and often no response. When they did
                           talk, it was so excitedly and so fast that I could scarcely understand what they said.

                        <p id="d47486e2479">None of the men had underclothing, overcoats or blankets. The Germans had taken away
                           their boots when they were captured, and many of them had walked miles—some a good
                           deal over a hundred—to get to the border and reach Châlons, the first town which could
                           feed them.

                           old tin cans, anything that would hold water which they had been able to gather up
                           along the way. That collection in itself was enough to make you cry.

                           are bringing with them. They need comfort and rest and food, and I wonder where they
                           will get it. Probably something will be provided somehow.

                           as much as the French; not quite as much, perhaps, for they looked as though they
                           would soon pick up, and the French looked as though they never would.

                           and no directions. Many of them even had not been told they could go. They thought
                           they had escaped, and wandered for days in the woods in the awful cold that we were
                           having at that time, with no shelter and no coverings; travelled at night and hid
                           in the daytime. I think those first ones who got back were in the worst condition.
                           Those who came later had had time to pick up a little, or had had more food, or were
                           more accustomed to the prisoner's life. The first who came were nearer the borders,
                           and many had been prisoners for months, not years.

                        <p id="d47486e2500">The English prisoners were really in the worst shape, but I don't <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2502"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="144" data-tei-n="106"> </a></span>think on that day there was much choice. I met an officer from Mailly, a big camp
                           and hospital not far away a day or two afterwards, and he told me they came there
                           by the thousands, in much the same condition in which we got them, only worse, covered
                           with vermin, covered with ulcers from lack of nourishment (they ate mostly beets and
                           "horse vegetables"), full of disease, and feet frozen. I wish that the German prisoners,
                           who look so fat and rosy here, could be made to look at themselves and then look at
                           the returning French. It might suggest a few things to their obstinate minds.

                        <p id="d47486e2506">That evening when I started for home I saw some women refugees going back of the canteen
                           and followed them to see where they were going. I found a long barrack, with two long
                           tables down the middle, filled with "rapatriés" (civil refugees just liberated from
                           the invaded country), being fed from our canteen. There must have been about two hundred
                           of them, men, women and children; young men, who at the time of the German occupation
                           were too young for the French army, but since then have grown up, and were on their
                           way to enlist in it now. There were little lights at intervals along the tables, to
                           give the room a suggestion of cheer, but the faces about the tables were worn, haggard
                           and unshaven, and as painful as the faces of the soldier prisoners in the canteen.
                           At one end of the room were a few women, old and young, some with babies, one with
                           a little baby very sick and quite immovable, and another with a little girl of about
                           eight. Mother and daughter looked alike and the expression of suffering and <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2508"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="145" data-tei-n="107"> </a></span>agony on the older face seemed only intensified on the younger. I can't understand
                           how a face so young could express as much as that, for it was mental as well as physical
                           suffering which showed there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2511">Mme. Oblin, an attractive little French woman who works with us, goes tomorrow to
                           see her brother, who has returned after six months in a German prison. He is a doctor
                           and should not have been held at all. He wrote that many from his camp would never
                           return, and that he could not have held out much longer.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2514">Very many of the prisoners died on the road trying to reach the frontier, and some
                           even died at canteens while they were waiting for food, but none at Châlons.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2517">The refugees from the occupied countries, too, were a great problem. They swarmed
                           through the canteen, old and young, women with children who were cold and hungry.
                           They filled up our kitchen and were under our feet wherever we turned. I know, for
                           I was doing kitchen work that week, "Chef d'Équipe" they call the job, to give it
                           a stylish sound, but it is anything but a stylish position to hold, and to have to
                           stop my work and hunt up bowls and plates and babies' milk, while every single worker
                           at the canteen was shouting at me at the same time, to attend to their needs, was
                           almost more than I could stand, and my heart did not seem to soften much to civil
                           refugees that week.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2520">Finally one night the "Chef de Gare" rushed over to the canteen in great consternation
                           and said, "A very disagreeable thing has just happened to me. One hundred and seventy-five
                           refugees have been landed <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2522"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="146" data-tei-n="108"> </a></span>at the station, cold and hungry, and I don't know what to do with them." So finally,
                           after much talk, we decided that the men who were able to walk were to come to the
                           canteen, and that we would take marmites of soup and coffee and baskets of bread over
                           to the waiting room of the station and feed the old men, women and children there.
                           It was about 12 o'clock and we worked until 1.30, feeding them and making them comfortable,
                           as comfortable as they could be, lying in bunches all over the station floor. Most
                           of the babies and children were too tired to wake up to eat. We never were able to
                           make some of them take a thing. The different families had brought with them all the
                           possessions which they had left, and they were sitting or lying in pathetic groups
                           on them. Old, old women and men, who could scarcely hobble about. Women nothing but
                           skin and bones, hatless and scarfless, most of them, all clad in queer clothes which
                           had no suggestion of warmth. Babies sick and cold, lying on their laps, or in little
                           piles beside them, all crowded into that big, cold, dismal waiting room, lighted only
                           by two dim lanterns. They were all grateful for the hot food we gave them, and when
                           we left, in the early morning, ambulance drivers—splendid English women—had come up
                           in their ambulances to take them off somewhere; I never did know where, but they were
                           all gone the next morning, when I went down to the station to meet Georgia Read, who
                           was to pass through on the Paris train.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2525">The train was late, and I saw two boys in American uniforms waiting round, so I went
                           up to speak to them. They turned out to be <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2527"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="147" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span>two war prisoners, an English and an Irish boy. They had left England together, August
                           12th, 1914. They had gone through all those awful Belgian battles, and most of the
                           other hard fighting in the war, and were taken prisoners at Verdun six months ago.
                           They had managed to stay together through thick and thin. I talked a long time to
                           the English boy. He said they had been horribly treated; flogged for no reasons whatever;
                           made to work until they could scarcely stand; almost no food; German bread not fit
                           for pigs, even; potatoes mixed with sawdust; and that was all except "horse vegetables."
                           One day when they were working they saw some poilus pass by. The Frenchmen called
                           out, "La guerre est finie," but the boys paid no attention to them. The next day a
                           German officer rode up to their guard, said something, and the interpreter turned
                           to them and told them they could go. The Germans had treated them as they treated
                           all other prisoners; their shoes had been taken away the instant they became prisoners;
                           also all their good clothes, so they were turned loose like the rest, with practically
                           nothing, and had walked many miles through Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, down to
                           Châlons. The canteen had given them their American clothes before I saw them, and
                           let them spend the night in our 
                           <add id="d47486e2529" hand="mh">"</add>abri
                           <add id="d47486e2532" hand="mh">"</add> (which, by the way, has never been entered since by any of us!), so they were more
                           decently clad and a little refreshed when I saw them. The English boy was of a stocky
                           build, and although thin had stood the hardships better than the Irish boy, who was
                           tall and of a more delicate makeup. He could not stand up without support, so <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2535"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="148" data-tei-n="110"> </a></span>leaned against the wall of the station. When I remarked to the English boy that his
                           companion looked sicker than he did, he said, "Yes; I was brought up on a farm and
                           he wasn't. I had an advantage to begin with." I watched the Irish boy for a while;
                           he looked so faint and ill, and his color was bad, and the far-away expression in
                           his eyes was very noticeable. The English boy was watching him too, and finally slipped
                           away and spoke a few words to him. "I just told him," he said to me when he came back,
                           "not to lose courage now that we are so near to dear old Blighty; we shall soon be
                           in Paris and get all fixed up in a hospital there." Then he went on to say, "I thought
                           I had lost him yesterday in a hospital, but I managed to keep him with me. When we
                           get to England I am going to take him home to the country with me and feed him up
                           on milk and eggs before I let him go back to Ireland." It was the sweetest little
                           war episode that I'd seen, and I'll never forget the devotion in the English boy's
                           eyes as he watched and guarded over his friend. I gave them a box of American cigarettes
                           and left them smoking peacefully on the platform, waiting for their train to Blighty.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2539">It's worse than war at present. The excitement is over and now we see the results
                           and the ravages on people and property. All through Châlons today I have seen little
                           groups of people with a prisoner in their midst, telling his experiences. I can't
                           understand much except that they all think Germany is on the point of starvation,
                           and not many of them complain of any especial cruelties being shown them by the <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2541"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="149" data-tei-n="111"> </a></span>Germans. They seem to think they didn't have the food to give them, and many of them
                           said that the Germans did not fare better themselves; that the soldiers who went home
                           to their families on 
                           <add id="d47486e2543" hand="mh">"</add>leave,
                           <add id="d47486e2546" hand="mh">"</add> in the north, had had to take enough food with them from the army to last the whole
                           length of their stay. Many would not go home at all because they knew they would have
                           nothing to eat. They say the Germans are as arrogant as ever. Of course, all I see
                           and hear is from certain localities. In some places the war and civil prisoners have
                           not fared badly. I talked one night to a woman and her very pretty young daughter,
                           who had been with the Germans for four years. They were passing through and came to
                           the canteen to rest in the kitchen. They had cultivated the fields all summer and
                           done farm work in the winter, threshing, etc. They said the officers were awful, but
                           the men not so bad.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2550">After the English prisoners, I'm told the Russians caught it worst, then the Italians,
                           French and ours. There was no mercy of any kind shown the English. The Germans called
                           them the "Straf" regiment, and whenever anything in the war went against them, they
                           took it out on those prisoners. They had enormous wooden clubs, which they used for
                           beating them. One of the prisoners brought one with him. Lots of samples of German
                           bread have come down. It looks as though it were mixed with sawdust, and they all
                           swear it is sawdust. It's black and hard and awful.

                        <p id="d47486e2553">It was interesting to see Châlons open up and blossom forth after <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2555"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="150" data-tei-n="112"> </a></span>the armistice. Three electric lights now hang over the rue de Marne. We have had a
                           week of beautiful sunshine and moonshine, the first moon for four years which the
                           people of Châlons have found beautiful. The others have all meant nights of suspense
                           and 
                           <add id="d47486e2557" hand="mh">"</add>alertes,

                        <p id="d47486e2564">The day after the signing, my old landlady's daughter, who owns the house, came back
                           with her two children, and in a few days all her best furniture arrived from the part
                           of the country where there had been no fear of bombardment. The Châlonais not only
                           went away themselves, but they took all their belongings; the householders their furniture,
                           and shopkeepers their merchandise. More and more young women and children appeared
                           on the streets. You can't imagine what a strange feeling I had when I saw the first
                           baby in its carriage; I realized then that it was the first I'd ever seen in Châlons.
                           Soon the shops began to open up, one by one, and it was possible to do a little more
                           shopping in the town.

                        <p id="d47486e2567">I have had the "caisse" in the evenings, with the usual terrific mob at the window.
                           It is very exhausting to see it seething, pushing and crowding up in front of me,
                           a regular football crowd, and to hear them say, "pas vite." I am not "vite" on purpose,
                           as they can't serve at the counter as fast as I can sell tickets, so it's better to
                           be a little slow. Can't say I feel altogether at home with centimes and sous, either.

                           the Frenchmen out of their way, and acted like the devil. They had no money. They
                           said they had come from the hospital and wanted free meals. They'd had enough money
                           to get drunk on, however. Even Miss Mitchell remarked that they were a disagreeable
                           lot. I never dare say a word about what I think, opinions are so strong and so varied
                           here that it is best not to express any, I find. However, I'm no fonder of a hoodlum

                           as cold as usual at this moment, for the warmth accumulated during the night has not
                           all escaped, and then I don't believe it is as cold outside as it has been. I've a
                           north room, over a dampish garden, and that, together with the lack of window glass,
                           keeps the room at an even degree of dampness. My wall paper is almost falling off.
                           Some mornings the trees are bowed down with their ice coverings. Today they aren't,
                           but it is dull and dreary so far; the kind of a day which makes one think of the families
                           at home whose only thankfulness can be that in the future no one else will have to
                           suffer as they have.

                           to win the war over here, was not made in vain. He expressed the gratitude of France
                           in the most touching way. He told how the French army was disheartened and worn out
                           by the years of fighting they had had; how the enemy was within fifteen miles of Paris,
                           the whole of northern France overrun, and then—hope had come with the American army,
                           and the French and English armies had taken courage, and as our men poured into France,
                           were able to hold the enemy where he was until we could train our army and take our
                           place in the lines. And from that time on, thanks to our courage and our fine men,
                           France began to be liberated. He gave us all the credit for saving his country. Without
                           us, the Germans would have taken it, and France would no longer have existed. "Thank
                           you, Americans. Thank you for your financial assistance, which came at the beginning,
                           all we wanted; thank you for your raw materials, and afterwards for your ammunition,

                           of any kind, so you see it is a hard search for them. One came to me for meat for
                           over a thousand of them, and I turned him over to our buyer, 
                           <ref id="d47486e2650">Monsieur Robin</ref>. Afterwards he came back and said Robin was going to fix them up, and he was very

                           her daughter are sleeping on their servants' little iron bedsteads. They can't get
                           a maid; none would come to Châlons, so they are doing all the work themselves, all
                           the work necessary for a camping life like that. They have two or three chairs and
                           a table or two; all the rest of their things have been sent away. Their ceilings are
                           half down, no glass in their windows, and the fireplaces are broken. The house next
                           door was totally destroyed by a bomb.

                           of LaFayette, and has many of <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2691"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="158" data-tei-n="118"> </a></span>his things—authentic. Her face shows the tragedy of life here more than any other
                           I've seen. She has lost her two sons, magnificent looking boys—she showed me their
                           pictures. One, a cavalry officer, was wounded, as was his horse, which fell upon him
                           so that he could not move. When the Germans went by, they shot him in the stomach
                           that he might suffer the more, and when the French drove them back again, he was still
                           alive, suffering indescribable pain from their bullets, from which he died about six
                           hours afterwards. Think of a mother's having to know all that! The other boy was killed
                           outright in action.

                           is most unpleasant. I even missed half a day's work and went to bed. I was in the

                           the suggestion that I should stay at home that night. I felt so sorry to miss my shift,
                           but knew it was the only thing to do then, as I could scarcely see. There isn't much
                           chance to rest, for our rooms are so cold that unless you go to bed you can't stay
                           in them. Even with a fire in mine, I have to sit in my fur coat, and the drafts on
                           the floor are so bad that I have to keep my feet on my woodpile, and the drafts about
                           my head are so bad that I have to keep my hat on. I never can sew a stitch, as my
                           hands are either too cold or too much swollen, and I wish to goodness I hadn't economized
                           and brought old stockings. They are full of holes already, and never get mended, and
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2696"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="159" data-tei-n="119"> </a></span>when they are entirely gone, I don't know what I shall do. Tell anyone coming over
                           to do reconstruction work, to have their clothes new and strong. I've had more annoyance
                           with mine tumbling to pieces the way they have. That, and the impossibility of keeping
                           decently clean, are the two things that have bothered me most; petty annoyances, I
                           mean. I make myself thoroughly disliked in the house here by demanding a good sized
                           pitcher of hot water once a week. The whole bath process is an affair of hours. I
                           have to make four or five trips down two flights of dark stairs, into the cellar,
                           to bring up my wood. I generally squash my fingers doing that, and almost crack my
                           leg bones trying to break faggots against them. It takes at least two hours for a
                           particle of heat to get out into the room. Then I lug my heavy washstand and water
                           so close to the fire that one side is blistered with the heat while the other is frozen.
                           After the thing is accomplished, I have to do all the mopping up, because the old
                           woman gets so mad if she sees a drop of water on the floor. By that time I'm about
                           worn out, and wonder what's the use of trying. I'm often late for luncheon and sometimes
                           have to cut it out altogether, in order to get to the canteen on time. The other days
                           I cut out cleanliness. It is my bath day about now; that's why I'm writing about it,
                           it is so unpleasantly on my mind. I envy those people who can take a cold bath in
                           a cold room. However, I know it isn't cleansing, so they aren't so much ahead of me
                           after all, although they appear superior.

                        <p id="d47486e2699">I am glad to say my meals have come over to this side of the river. The club where
                           I eat has moved, and I am nearer it now. I've <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2701"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="160" data-tei-n="120"> </a></span>taken a room there, but it isn't finished or cleaned yet. Don't know whether or not
                           I'll be more comfortable. I only thought if I were ill, food would be more get-at-able
                           there. Here I did not eat for almost twenty-four hours; had one roll and cup of coffee,
                           my regular breakfast, and a cup of chocolate—extra—given me very reluctantly by my
                           landlady, who said she would do it for 
                           <hi id="d47486e2703" style="text-decoration: underline;">once</hi>, with emphasis on the

                           die of typhoid; in fact I don't know how we live at all. One of the nurses who was
                           in my stateroom coming over has had a bad attack of pneumonia; another has gone home
                           with incipient tuberculosis. Several have died, and almost all have had either grippe
                           or pneumonia, so you see I'm one of the fittest. Other horrid diseases are about—anthrax,
                           Spanish grippe, trench colds and trench mouth—not here, though, but in some of the
                           canteens. I always carry my own

                        <p id="d47486e2713">One evening I went to dinner with Mme. de la T., a French nurse, who lives in a box
                           car which is attached to sanitary trains and goes back and forth from the front to
                           different hospitals in the middle of France. She has been doing it for four years.
                           Her car is a most fascinating place; half of it is a big kitchen with a long stove,
                           etc., where two poilus prepare the food for the "blessés." Her half is all white enamel
                           paint and is attractively furnished. She has a little stateroom and salon, all very
                           comfortably arranged. The next day she was to be attached to a hospital train from
                           La Veuve, to go to Limoges, and wanted me to go with her,—a four days' trip. It would
                           have been an <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2715"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="161" data-tei-n="121"> </a></span>unusual experience, but I felt I could not ask for the time off.

                        <p id="d47486e2719">I am a little behind in sleep, as I've had four out of six weeks of evening work.
                           I am always waked up at six A.M. by the racket my old woman makes in the kitchen;
                           at seven the family wrangling begins, and the high-pitched rasping voices always drive
                           me out of bed. The old woman scolds her daughter, and her daughter scolds her, and
                           they both scold the children, and I can't help wondering through how many generations
                           this scolding will be passed down.

                        <p id="d47486e2722">A nurse, a friend of Mme. de la T., took me over the evacuation hospital which was
                           bombed. It was full of "rapatriés," four hundred for this one woman to look out for;
                           men, women and children all living in the same barracks, piled in, as many as possibly
                           could sleep in one place,—an awful sight. They told me about their lives with the
                           Boches. Almost everyone says the same thing—that the soldiers weren't as bad as the
                           officers. The women had had hard times, I take it. It was a frightfully depressing
                           sight, to see them all crowded in, regardless of sex, regardless of family; a life
                           capable of absolutely no privacy or decency. Many were sickly and all were underfed
                           and in poor condition. One man was rubbing a woman's leg for her. They needed clothes
                           and shoes and the nurse asked me if the canteen could help her. She told me that fourteen
                           thousand "blessés" went through the evacuation hospital in ten days during the last
                           drive.

                        <p id="d47486e2727">I've moved. Jeanne's husband came and helped me. I got a blanket from the Red Cross
                           to put on my bed, to sleep on, and eight towels, one of which I spread out for my
                           head, as there is no pillow, and the towel has a pleasanter feeling than the blanket.
                           There are no sheets here, but I am not used to sheets now; I haven't had any for three
                           months. I roll up in my own blanket, put the French army blanket and my steamer rug
                           over me, and there I am. Bought a slop pail for five dollars or more, a basin for
                           two dollars, and a tin pitcher, which makes my water rusty. Spent days trying to find
                           them, even, as there were none to be had in Châlons.

                        <p id="d47486e2730">All this time that the prisoners have been coming down from Germany, the Army of Occupation
                           has been going up. Every morning waked by the bands or fanfare of their trumpets,
                           I rush to the window to watch the regiments go by, pinch myself, and say, "That's
                           the Army going into Germany." Infantry and artillery pass, poilus in blue, and Zouaves
                           and Colonials in khaki and red hats, all in fine form, looking spick and span. Then
                           a little later, a train gets in, which always brings crowds of returning prisoners,
                           most of them in the old red caps and red trousers of 1914, carrying wooden boxes and
                           all kinds of queer bundles. Sometimes Anamites go through, with bundles balanced on
                           the end of long poles, Chinese fashion. Senegalese and Arabs come, too, in their separate
                           detachments, all looking pale,—as pale as pale they can,—thin, sick and thoroughly
                           worn out. Every day for weeks this has gone on, and I fly out of bed to watch. Great
                           cannon rattle up the street, sometimes pontoons carried on camions, and the other

                           decided rather suddenly to come, too. (I was the only person in the canteen who had
                           not been to Paris, so asked for a three days' permission).

                           a chance on getting a room, but we were held up at Chateau Thierry for hours by an
                           accident ahead, had to go back to Epernay, and take a round-about route, arriving
                           at nine o'clock, after which hour no food can be had; so we were not only <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2763"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="165" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span>roomless but foodless, as we had eaten nothing since 8 A.M.!

                           in the station and subway were colossal; it took a long time even to get a ticket.
                           We had our packs on our backs like all the poilus and "militaires." Miss Angellotti
                           looked very attractive, but I had sunk to almost the lowest stage of my looks, and
                           was so tired I didn't care much.

                           for rooms, so we decided to ask to sit up in the parlor of the Hotel Petrograd, which
                           the Y.W.C.A. had taken. There they offered us two cots in a dormitory of eleven, but
                           when we went up we found only one. The place was distinctly unattractive, and we both
                           decided against it. We asked for food, but they threw up their hands and told us it
                           was forbidden. However, as a great concession they gave us a cup of chocolate and
                           piece of bread, with the first butter we had seen since leaving America. It was nearly
                           midnight, and the room reserved for a woman until then, not having been claimed, was
                           given to us, so after all we were installed in luxury in a single bed. In the bathroom
                           there was only cold water. The maid told me that the American women all washed themselves
                           and their clothes so often that there was never enough hot water even to wash the
                           dishes!

                           off on rue Royale. At the Boulevards we were stopped, but I told the guard we were
                           American "militaires," and wanted to join the American Red Cross, so they let us through,
                           and we drove down the Boulevards in state, the only cab allowed!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2778">It was a fine day. The decorations were much more delicate than ours; there were flags
                           of the Allies out of every window, either alone or in groups, all about the same size,
                           which made Paris very lovely. French infantry lined the Boulevards, cavalry where
                           it was needed, and artillery surrounded the Arc de Triomphe. There we had to get out,
                           but were again allowed to pass, and walked, as only Americans could, in the middle
                           of the Avenue, all the way up to the station. All our organizations were lined up
                           together, and the "blessés," French and American, in wheel-chairs, were on the edges
                           of the sidewalks. Opposite the station were drawn up a detachment of Arabs in gorgeous
                           red robes on white steeds, and drawn up there, too, were Miss Angellotti and M. H.,
                           where we could get a view of the whole Avenue du Bois de Boulogne and the Arc in the
                           distance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2781">The American boys amused the French crowd by climbing like monkeys up into the trees.
                           Each time a boy pulled himself safely up on a branch, they would cry out, "Ça y est,"
                           with the utmost delight. The trees all the way down the Avenue looked as if they were
                           covered with huge bunches of mistletoe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2784">At ten o'clock precisely the guns began to boom. The President and his family stepped
                           out of the station, the Republican guard trotted <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2786"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="167" data-tei-n="126"> </a></span>up, and the party was driven off in carriages drawn by fine prancing horses. There
                           was much cheering and American whistling,—a thing which never fails to shock the French,
                           with whom it is an expression of disapproval.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2789">In a few seconds it was all over, and we could see nothing but a company of French
                           lancers, with their gay little pennants, trotting down the Avenue, through crowds
                           of people, more numerous, it is said, than Paris had ever seen before.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2792">Wilson looked dignified enough, but Mrs. Wilson looked cheap in a cocky hat perched
                           on top of her head, smiling much too broadly, with head and chubby shoulders framed
                           in a big wreath of flowers which had been presented to her and which she held in her
                           hands. (She wore orchids!) "Miss Margaret" was beyond description in cheapness of
                           action. She sat facing Mme. Poincare and Mrs. W., grinning a grin which showed all
                           her white teeth, and shaking "da da's" and "so longs" to the crowd, with her big white-gloved
                           hand. Even one of the American boys looked at me and said, "That doesn't look very
                           dignified for the President's daughter to do," so if he noticed it, I'm convinced
                           that my eyes were not so prejudiced that I've done her an injustice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2796">We walked down the Avenue and the Champs Elysees. Everything was crowded but there
                           was no uncomfortable pushing. The Place de la Concorde is full of German guns camouflaged,
                           and covered then with little boys watching the show. Strasbourg is gay with flags
                           and flowers; her mourning was taken off almost the very second that the Armistice
                           was signed. Across rue Royale stretched in enormous electric-lighted letters, "Welcome,
                           Wilson the Just," (irritating to me).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2799">In the afternoon we again went forth to view the crowd. It was <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2801"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="168" data-tei-n="127"> </a></span>exactly like Armistice Day, people said. Just a slowly moving mass of people, interrupted
                           every once in a while by the boisterous Parisian students, who swept everything and
                           everyone aside as they dove through the crowds.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2804">About dusk we found ourselves near the Opéra, and heard music, a band at the entrance,
                           so we went up the steps to listen and watch the dense masses in front and all the
                           way up Avenue de l'Opéra. One of the buildings opposite was decorated with electric
                           lights, which spread an attractive glow over the scene. The crowds were so thick that
                           it didn't seem as though another person could get into that square, when suddenly
                           there was a fanfare of trumpets, the crowd parted, and a cavalry regiment wound its
                           way through and out the other side of the "Place." Theatrical—not the wildest imagination
                           of the greatest Belasco could have conceived a scene like that. They went through
                           slowly, led by their trumpeters,—the kind who flourish their instruments in the air
                           between notes,—carrying their pennants, most of them with mimosa stuck in their caps
                           or uniforms, the crowds cheering and waving frantically at them, and the band on the
                           steps playing the "Marseillaise." Finally the field kitchen came along, smoking, preparing
                           their evening meal,—we could almost smell their hot coffee,—and at the end the ambulance.
                           How that man drove his car I don't know. He was sitting on the edge of his seat, leaning
                           out, waving both arms madly at the crowd, first on one side and then on the other,
                           but as I didn't see him stop to pick up a "blessé" I suppose he got through all right.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2807">That evening the Boulevard crowds were out and our boys were the centre of attraction.
                           Most of them had lost their caps, or put them <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2809"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="169" data-tei-n="128"> </a></span>away for safe keeping; lost, I rather think, to the French "Mademoiselles" for "souvenirs."

                        <p id="d47486e2821">I got back at 1.30 Monday night, very much of a wreck. Found that I was on the evening
                           shift, which gave me free days, so on Wednesday, three of us went to Chateau Thierry
                           for the day, leaving at seven and having a sleepy trip down. It never rained much
                           harder, but we never stay at home for rain, for it never stops. When we got there
                           we escaped the M.P.s, so that we should not be asked for papers and passes. We picked
                           up an American boy in a little open Ford truck, who said he was going out by Belleau
                           Woods and would take us along. In we piled, Mrs. Earle in front, Miss Angellotti and
                           I in back, sitting on we didn't know what, we were in such a hurry not to let the
                           boy escape us. After a while he said he was going to make a round trip through three
                           or four of the destroyed towns, and we could go if we liked. Charmed was not the word
                           for our feelings
                           <add id="d47486e2823" hand="mh">,</add> although rain was pouring in rivers off our hats, coats, and noses. We passed Belleau
                           Woods and saw great piles of hand grenades and ammunition dumps along the roadsides.
                           The boy told us he was to find an American battlefield burying
                           <add id="d47486e2826" hand="mh">-</add>ground, and it turned out that he was an undertaker and we were sitting on piles of
                           the little wooden crosses which were to mark the graves of our boys who lost their
                           lives at Chateau Thierry! This boy belonged to a squad who went through the woods
                           and fields, collected <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2829"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="170" data-tei-n="fp129"> </a></span>

                           "battlefield cemetery." There are many of those little cemeteries all around Chateau
                           Thierry, and many little lonely American graves still unfound. One half of Belleau
                           Woods is full of our dead, the other half full of Germans.

                        <p id="d47486e2852">We had a wonderfully interesting drive, found loot in the way of old shell cases,
                           and saw little towns much flatter than any near Rheims. We dined at the Hotel de Cygne
                           with a lot of United States Congressmen who were touring the country. We wanted to
                           go to Soissons, but there was no time, and we heard that the Germans had set time
                           fuses in the ammunition dumps near there, so the road was dangerous for the moment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2855">In the afternoon we walked to the little town of Courteau, all shelled up and picturesque
                           as the dickens, talked to an old man and woman, whose house, just outside the town,
                           had been destroyed, and who lived all in a mess in an awful old hole in their barn,
                           with a little stove and nothing much else. Some of the family were killed in a bombardment,
                           and the grave took up about the whole space in their little courtyard.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e2858">The town was wholly deserted except for one American soldier, a nice boy, who was
                           wandering round alone, dreaming.

                        <p id="d47486e2862">Miss Angellotti went through agonies trying to decide whether or not to take a brass
                           candlestick off a piano which was upside down in a destroyed house. They never would
                           have been used again, so it seemed perfectly all right to take it.

                        <p id="d47486e2867">From there we climbed by a foot path up to the hill just above Chateau Thierry where
                           our boys had fought so hard, and we tried to picture how it looked down in the valley
                           of the Marne and across on the other hills those summer days when they were rushed
                           there from all quarters, almost pushed off the trains, told to place their cannon
                           and fire, where or in what direction they didn't know, and no one else seemed to know,
                           so I've been told over and over again. It was a real battlefield, not much cleared
                           up; old guns, old clothes, old equipment strewn round everywhere; trees shot down,
                           great shell holes, so deep that if you'd fallen in you'd never have come out; and
                           above all, the constant unpleasant reminder that there had been no time to take proper
                           care of the dead.

                        <p id="d47486e2870">We crawled back by train to Châlons, loaded down with loot—German loot—which I've
                           since had a Boche prisoner case up for me, in hopes that I can land it somewhere in
                           the U.S.A. We were almost dead when we got back, at half past ten, but went to the
                           canteen for an hour and a half, that our substitutes might go home.

                           Thierry trips, when a chance to go up to Sedan turned up for Mrs. Earle and me, and
                           naturally we took it. We went up with a nice boy from Chestnut Hill, in a little Ford

                           had had their same lines and trenches for four years, from which they couldn't be
                           budged until the last terrific drive; through little towns so flat that at night our
                           boy told us you never knew you were going through a village; but not so flat as one
                           we passed through later, where in broad daylight I had to be told I was going through
                           a town, and even then I couldn't seem to see it. Our companion was nice and patient,
                           and let us get out whenever we wanted to; showed us artillery emplacements, and explained
                           how things were as much as he could. Warfare will never penetrate my brain, though.
                           I simply can't think what it is like. We walked through the trenches, saw little listening
                           posts, and shelves cut out in the sides which were marked "Explosives." Went down
                           into the dugouts, saw human bones all about, and many little crosses with helmets,
                           French helmets, hung on them. The boys were buried, evidently, where they fell. Here
                           the German and French lines were very near together; barbed wire entanglements were
                           in front of all, and spread out round the country besides. The trenches themselves
                           were not as deep as I thought they would be—not the French ones, but the German were
                           different; much deeper, and the dugouts much deeper, with steps and sides made almost
                           of matched boards, they were so well constructed. Between the two lines of trenches—No
                           Man's Land—there was nothing but white ploughed-up clay, which looked like the Bad
                           Lands in our Petrified Forest. Land turned over and over and over; barren, desolate,
                           awful; not a sign of life anywhere, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e2919"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="175" data-tei-n="fp132"> </a></span>

                        <p id="d47486e2939">On the German side there were crosses, too, in the midst of the desolation, but bigger
                           ones, more ornate, made of iron, with bigger steel helmets on them, often gaudy with
                           their camouflage. I was crazy to go down into their dugouts. In the back line trenches
                           they come with great regularity; I should say about fifty feet apart, and were at
                           least thirty feet deep, with steep wooden steps, almost chute-the-chutes in their
                           steepness, leading down into subterranean rooms. It didn't seem best to take the risk,
                           though. There are all sorts of snares and traps left behind for the unwary; electric
                           connections which can be made by stepping on certain places, and in a second you are
                           nothing but pieces; hand grenades left on top of doors, ready to tumble off at the
                           slightest provocation and maim you for life. People are injured and killed all the
                           time hunting souvenirs. The Germans were aware of this American passion, and did many
                           diabolical things to catch our boys during the war. There is great danger even now.
                           I have seen a girl pick up a German "potato masher" (a hand grenade of the most dangerous
                           variety), and run after me exclaiming "Do look at this funny thing!" "Hands Off" and
                           "Watch Your Step" are the rules for battlefield conduct, and it's annoying to a party
                           when some of its members do not observe them.

                        <p id="d47486e2942">We saw all sorts of dugouts; one of the most interesting a German regimental kitchen,
                           all concrete, with big stoves, shelves and tables; quite an elaborate affair. The

                        <p id="d47486e2970">We went through the little town of Somme Py, where only the ruined church is standing.
                           On its wall is still the figure of the Virgin. We could tell where the Germans had
                           made a stand in their retreat to Sedan by the way the towns and country were shot
                           up. Vouziers is pretty much destroyed, not a whole house there, I imagine. But after
                           that they must have gone pretty fast. All the bridges are down, and flimsy temporary
                           ones are in their places; telegraph poles down, and trees felled flat, for no visible
                           or conceivable reason, for they are lying in the fields and never were meant to obstruct
                           the roads. There were great holes in the roads, especially at the cross roads, all
                           of which were mined. Some mines have not yet gone off; there are red flags to indicate
                           them, and to suggest that the passerby does not linger there. Many have gone off,
                           and to pass them you have to take to the fields and mud, as the road there does not
                           exist. Crowds of ammunition has been left, too. The roadsides are lined with it, and
                           the woven baskets which the Germans used to bring up their shells in, are lying all
                           about. I wanted to bring one home, but they were too bulky. The question of doing
                           your own lugging puts a damper on collecting salvage, no matter how enticing it is.
                           All along, too, beside the roads and in the fields near by, were the little graves,
                           so pathetic in their loneliness.

                        <p id="d47486e2975">We got lost and took a longer way round, but it was interesting. We reached Sedan
                           about dark. I had thought the Americans entered Sedan first, but it seems they stood
                           aside and let the French go in, as was right.

                        <p id="d47486e2978">Nothing had been destroyed but the railroad station. We went to the Red Cross place
                           and were lucky enough to get one room, and had our food in a room where the Crown
                           Prince had his whenever he went through Sedan. The beer mugs used for our water had
                           crowns in the bottom.

                           on the railroad, trying to get some connection with the outside world.

                        <p id="d47486e2984">Sedan is almost foodless. The question of feeding the people in the districts evacuated
                           by the Germans is a great problem. No railroad tracks go up to them. French camions
                           are in none too good shape after their four years' service, and there is almost no
                           way to get food into these towns. The people really suffered less under the Germans
                           than they do now, although their fare was scant enough before, goodness knows.

                        <p id="d47486e2987">As soon as we got to Sedan we hunted up the S.S.U., to try to find transportation
                           back, and discovered a sergeant whom Mrs. Earle knew, who was going back to Epernay
                           the next morning and said he would take us along.

                        <p id="d47486e2990">I got up early and had time to walk up to the old Château, all in ruins; not the ruins

                           where we again went to the cathedral, and had a tussle with the cranky old guardian,
                           who as usual nagged us to death. We passed the interesting vineyards on the hillsides
                           near Epernay, where we caught a very much belated train, and got to Châlons in time
                           for service.

                        <p id="d47486e2999">When we start off on these trips, we never know when or how or where we are going
                           to land. We generally take bread and food enough to tide us through, and trust to
                           luck that some shelter can be found at night, and some means of transportation back
                           in the morning. It's nervous business, especially as you always have a shift waiting
                           for you at a certain hour, which you must take, and by the time I land in Châlons
                           I am much more of a wreck than when I start out. But why be here in the midst of it
                           and not see it, even if it kills you in the end!

                        <p id="d47486e3019">The night before Christmas we had two large trees. The poilus sang Christmas songs
                           standing around them, and on top of all the tables near by. On Christmas with every
                           meal we gave a cigarette, and in the afternoon some of the workers carried little
                           decorated trees through the hospitals.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3022">New Year's eve was much the same, but there was not much spontaneity about the singing.
                           That day we gave free dinners, little calendars, and bunches of cigarettes (five in
                           a bunch), but the poilus and Italians came in such mobs that we had to stop giving
                           out the cigarettes, for some came a second and third time. Things are always spoiled
                           by some selfish creatures in the crowd. In the afternoon Mrs. Earle, Miss Worthington
                           and I took cigarettes, cakes and mirrors out to La Veuve to give to the "blessés."
                           The boys seemed to like the things. It's an enormous hospital, with railroad tracks
                           running all through it. There are trenches dug between the walls. Mrs. Earle gave
                           a mirror with Pershing's picture on it to one of the Boche prisoners, and had to go
                           back when she found out he was a German, to get it. She was afraid he would stamp
                           on it when he found out what it was. It was most awkward, as he thought she was going
                           to give him something else when she held out her hand to get it back. She told him
                           it wouldn't interest him. The hospital is one of the most depressing places I've <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3024"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="182" data-tei-n="137"> </a></span>seen over here, filled with the wreckage left after the storm!

                        <p id="d47486e3030">I'm selling postcards this evening, the first time for ages, so between customers
                           I can write a few words. A Russian has just gone out to get his "camarade" who can
                           speak English, to talk to me, so my letter will probably be a little disjointed. Yesterday
                           I got a letter from Conrad from Germany. I had given him a little lecture on not liking
                           the Germans too much, and he said he wouldn't. Their propaganda in our army is dreadful.
                           A drunk has just come up and 
                           <hi id="d47486e3032" style="text-decoration: underline;">would</hi> sit down in the chair beside me and get very close. I did not know how to get rid
                           of him, so told him I would have to write my letter and he could come back afterwards,
                           and he went smilingly away. We have a great many "zig zags" in the evenings now. Two
                           nights ago an American Indian, a Cherokee, went up to our apartment, took the key
                           out of the door, and told an M.P. later on as a great joke that he had locked up two
                           American women and one Frenchman together. Luckily, though, he did not lock the door,
                           for if he had, I'd have had to sleep on the stairs, as I always keep my key in the
                           kitchen. * * The drunk is back, standing over me grinning, but I'll pay no attention
                           to him and hope he'll depart. He wants me to be good to him, he says. Just this instant
                           a crazy man has come up to shake hands with me, and now has gone away, shaking hands
                           again, to drink chocolate. There have been two around the canteen lately. They have
                           lost all their families in the war and are hanging round because they don't know where
                           or how to find their regiments. There will <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3035"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="183" data-tei-n="138"> </a></span>be lots of wrecks like that in France; too much war, too many shocks, for their brains
                           to stand. That old drunk! I've told him this is to be a long letter and to go away
                           and sit down, but he murmurs that he likes to watch me, and something about Mrs. Wilson.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3038">The work is hard in the canteen now. Mobs most of the time about to be demobilized,
                           and as usual I'm on evening duty. Tonight I stay until midnight and begin again at
                           six in the morning, which means about five hours' sleep for me. It's been awfully
                           cold here, freezing weather. Tonight it is a little warmer and there's a snowstorm
                           on. We are all tired; everyone in canteen work gets tired at intervals. They sink
                           to a point where it doesn't seem as though they could go on, and then start up again.

                        <p id="d47486e3041">I hear the French are less cordial about Wilson's visit than they were in the beginning.
                           They think he is rather German in sympathy. He hasn't been yet to see the devastated
                           region; says he doesn't want to be prejudiced by it, the newspaper says. Wish he'd
                           had a little taste of German bombardment, and then see how he'd feel. The old drunk
                           is back again! He told me I was writing too long a letter. * * He has gone away, and
                           will return presently!

                        <p id="d47486e3044">I'd like to go up to Verdun, but it seems hard to get away, and harder to get transportation
                           when we do get off for a day. That drunk will drive me to drink! Keeps talking about
                           Mr. Wilson, so I've told him I'll write and tell Mr. Wilson he won't let me finish
                           my letter. * * Can't shake him. All the rest of the poilus are much interested, and
                           if he keeps on much longer I'll shut up shop and go home.

                           now; aren't sent to a post office which doesn't exist. That old drunk makes me nervous.
                           He's very pleasant, thank goodness, and not of the cross variety. Now he keeps sticking
                           his watch in my face. Guess I'll go. He furnishes too much amusement for the room,
                           and my French is not equal to the occasion. Perhaps it's just as well.

                        <p id="d47486e3065">My next venture was Verdun. I asked to be allowed to use four days of "permission"
                           to go up there. We went by train to Bar-le-Duc and then took up our stand beside an
                           American M.P. on the Verdun road and waited. M.P.'s can stop all cars on the road,
                           so it's best to shift responsibility to them. Finally, rather late in the afternoon,
                           we found transportation, a Ford truck going up to a camp outside of Verdun. It was
                           thrilling going up the "Voie Sacrée"—the magnificent road over which all the troops
                           marched up to Verdun. It was dark when we got near Verdun, and as we didn't know where
                           to go, we let the boy land us where he thought best—in his barracks. We had thought
                           of staying at the Y.M.C.A. If women visitors get there in time, they put up cots for
                           them in the office, and if there happens to be an extra blanket, they can have it.
                           If not, "tant pis." I knew we were too late for that. The boys thought we could stay
                           in their camp (I didn't), so they kept us, fed us to coffee and squash pie, then <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3067"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="185" data-tei-n="140"> </a></span>took us to their Y.M.C.A. and turned us over to an officer. We had struck the camp—the
                           13th Engineers—the great night of their sojourn abroad, the night when the moving
                           picture called "Smiles" was to be given. Probably you know about it; the one where
                           all the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sweethearts, wives and babies of the
                           Chicago boys marched in front of the picture machine. The 13th Engineers were for
                           the most part from Chicago, so you may imagine the impatience with which they had
                           awaited that film. The hall was packed early. The newly assembled band, with magnificent
                           shining brass instruments, played American tunes, which I had not heard since I've
                           been here, out of tune, but so grand to hear! Every once in a while some delighted
                           boy would shout out, "Hello, Dad!" or "There they go!" The Lieutenant who had us in
                           charge found his mother and sister, and was going to hunt for his wife the next time
                           the film was given. It was to stay until every boy had seen it enough and felt satisfied.

                        <p id="d47486e3070">We found our Lieutenant had helped to build the Châlons canteen, so he was especially
                           nice and gave us a car after the show to take us to Glorieux Hospital, just outside
                           of Verdun, where I knew I could stay, as Miss Frances Mitchell, who had been in our
                           canteen, had asked me to stay with her if I came to Verdun. We were put into a stoveless
                           room with four cots in it, one already occupied, in the nurses' quarters. It was dismal,
                           there's no mistake about it. It seemed queer to be with Americans, and to see all
                           the little towns on the way up filled with Americans, billeted there, all standing
                           up in line as we went

                           fixing the roads. It was all American, the whole way from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. The
                           boys cheered us and waved to us and we were so glad to see each other, as we flew
                           by.

                        <p id="d47486e3098">The next morning we had an American breakfast, served by a nice American boy, after
                           which we got a truck into Verdun. There are no civilians there, and it is very much
                           shattered; not as badly as Rheims, I should think. The ruins are older than those
                           at Rheims, softened by time, and some almost moss covered. The streets were full of
                           American soldiers. All nationalities—Russian, Bulgarian, Austrian and German prisoners—in
                           fact were there, but Americans were in charge. We wandered around the town and into
                           the citadel, through which we were taken. Of course, it's an enormous place, with
                           accommodations for twenty thousand or more soldiers, a chapel, Y.M.C.A., Foyer de
                           Soldat, a huge bakery where thousands of loaves are baked, all under ground, but it's
                           just a modern fortress which you can see at any time. The troops went through there,
                           but there were never many who stayed. I had an idea they lived there the whole time,
                           in multitudes. The top of the citadel was ready for the enemy, trenched and barbed
                           wired, but it was very much shot to pieces, the place had been so continuously shelled.
                           The man in charge of the Foyer de Soldat was one of the most pathetic I'd seen in
                           France. He looked so pale and sick, and by his color you could tell that sunshine
                           was what he needed, and not the artificial light and artificial air of subterranean
                           life. His "cafard" was beyond <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3100"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="188" data-tei-n="fp142"> </a></span>

                           for him was too dismal to be endured, and it didn't look as if he'd have to endure
                           it much longer.

                        <p id="d47486e3112">In the afternoon we thought we'd like to see the country outside of Verdun, so placed
                           ourselves again on the road and procured transportation up to Stenay. A nice boy in
                           an ambulance said he was going up to the hospital there, where we could spend the
                           night, and come back in an ambulance the next day. We lost no time in climbing in,
                           and had another wonderful trip along the Meuse, through all those battlefields and
                           ruined towns, towns so flat that we only knew there had been a town by a signpost
                           with its name on it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3116">There were always the same holes along the road where individual boys had dug themselves
                           in when the road was shelled. The same piles of used and unused ammunition, the same
                           "abris" under the ground, the same little crosses by the roadside, only with American
                           helmets on these, and the same little narrow-gauge railroad which you see all over
                           this part of France, used to take supplies and ammunition to the front. (Germans had
                           the same). Some of the destruction here had been caused by American guns, for this
                           was the edge of our great battlefield, the Argonne, across the Meuse. Dun-sur-Meuse,
                           on a hilltop over the river, was a dream of picturesqueness, if you can call anything
                           so dreadful picturesque. Here, too, the bridges and telegraph poles were down, and
                           the long lines of beautiful old shade trees cut down, to complete the systematic ruin
                           of northern France.

                           them along the way. Soon the road signs all became German. It's the queerest thing
                           the way the French have left the German signs up everywhere. Even little pasteboard
                           signs pinned on doors are still there.

                        <p id="d47486e3133">At Stenay we stayed in what was originally French barracks, which had been used for
                           a German hospital, and had the big Red Cross painted on the roof. In all the rooms
                           were German slates, which had been used over the beds of patients, with the patient's
                           name and list of his wounds written on them. In several rooms there were pictures
                           of the Kaiser, Crown Prince, Hindenberg, etc. painted on the walls, life size, and
                           in another building, in a room evidently used as a bar, the walls were covered with
                           frescoes and portraits of the Royal family and celebrities. German signs "Silence"
                           and "Shut the door" were still up; a German piano was in the nurses' room. In fact,
                           from all appearances, you might have been in Germany. Outside the hospital near by
                           was a big German rifle range. We were told not to step off the driveways, for the
                           grounds were thought to be mined. Quite regularly we heard great reports, like cannon,
                           and explosions go off; mines or ammunition dumps being exploded. It was almost like
                           being under fire, they were so near. The sky was lighted by them at night, and some
                           sounded and looked as though they were just outside of the hospital yard. The doctors
                           and nurses had been called up there for typhoid pneumonia and accident cases. Some
                           boys were so sick! Two died while we were there.

                        <p id="d47486e3139">In the evening some of the nurses, doctors, Mrs. Earle and I went down to Stenay to
                           see a Y.M.C.A. show, the first any of the boys had seen over here,—three girls and
                           one man. One girl whistled and danced and acted, and seemed professional; the others
                           were not, I think. Of course the little professional had "pep" and was most popular,
                           and she was pretty, too, and nice to watch. The remarks of the boys were sweet. "I
                           want to go home!" they wailed out when they first saw the girls. "That's what we have
                           in America." "Why don't you give us shows like this once in a while?" "We wouldn't
                           mind staying if you treat us this way," etc., etc. The hall was packed and icy cold,
                           but the show was an enormous success.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3142">That night we slept on the night nurses' cots, just rolled up in blankets, and the
                           next morning took a chance, let the ambulance go off without us, and went down to
                           Stenay to see the Château where the Crown Prince had lived for thirty months. He had
                           kept the same French caretaker who was in the house when he came, and she showed us
                           about. We saw his seat at the head of the table used for officers; his bedroom and
                           the fine bathroom he had had put in. The other bedrooms belonged to officers; one
                           to the General who took Fort Douaumont. She said the Crown Prince wasn't bad, he stole
                           nothing, but his officers took what they wanted. All the magnificent silver was gone
                           and many other things of value. Whenever the Emperor came, he and the Prince would
                           dine alone in the salon, never with the officers. Father never spent the night. He
                           had a very hard, stern face, so the woman told us. I asked <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3144"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="193" data-tei-n="145"> </a></span>if there had been much revelry, and she discreetly said she had always been downstairs
                           in the evening and did not know what had happened upstairs. The thing that pleased
                           me most was the 
                           <add id="d47486e3146" hand="mh">"</add>abri
                           <add id="d47486e3149" hand="mh">"</add> which the gentleman (!) had had built for himself under the house,—of steel and concrete,
                           and to which he had had to retire sometimes twice in one night! It was an underground
                           cellar, with a long deep passageway which opened far out into the garden, so he could
                           escape through that if the house were destroyed.

                        <p id="d47486e3153">Means of transportation back to Verdun were rather scarce, so we had time to walk
                           along the road for quite a distance and examine the American graves. One especially
                           I remember, covered with all the boy's possessions, even his old woolen gloves. Finally
                           we got a lift as far as Dun. There some American boys took us in, fed us, and let
                           us warm ourselves by their enormous improvised stove, which took up practically one
                           whole room. From there on we had very stylish transportation, in a much camouflaged
                           White automobile, which whirled us into Verdun in no time. That night there was a
                           little entertainment at the hospital by K.C.'s.

                        <p id="d47486e3156">The next day we decided to make a try for Fort Douaumont or Fort Vaux. When we asked
                           the Colonel for permission to go into Verdun in an ambulance, he told us he was going
                           in himself and would take us and drop us on the right road, but he never did drop
                           us until we got as near Douaumont as an automobile can go; quite far away, really.
                           We drove on and on through the country so famous for its battles, in

                           without a tree or a living thing anywhere for miles and miles; trenches near by and
                           in the distance, going round and over the hills, barbed wire, shell holes, and all
                           along the road everywhere, as close as they could be put, emplacements for guns, all
                           camouflaged over, and

                           and the Colonel realize that we were to have been set down on the road to find our
                           way up alone. Finally we landed on top of a hill, Fort Sousville, a hole in the hillside.
                           Then I 
                           <hi id="d47486e3176" style="text-decoration: underline;">was</hi> upset, for I thought the Colonel would give up the search for our road, but no, indeed;
                           he persevered and landed us beside a little narrow-gauge track, where there was a
                           sign "Fort Douaumont." It was raining cats and dogs; there was not a sign of human
                           life or any life to be seen; we had come a roundabout way into the hills; there was
                           not a landmark of any sort to guide us on our homeward walk, and when the Colonel
                           murmured, "Can you get back all right?" I said, "Yes, indeed," but I thought, "Oh,
                           heavens!" The loneliness, the desolation, the devastation, the silence, of that spot
                           is greater than any other spot in the whole world, I think. The automobile turned
                           around and disappeared. I watched it go, and then we were left by ourselves, in an
                           unknown country, in the pouring rain, in the Verdun mud, not any too early in the
                           day, alone with the dead. It is hard to describe it. It seemed as though we were up
                           in the mountains too high for vegetation to grow; that there had been a terrific upheaval

                           either alone or in little groups, had been quickly covered by a sprinkling of earth,
                           and left to the end of time,—each with a little wooden cross decorated with the French
                           cockade, to show that it was "for France" that they were there. We followed the little
                           railroad, stopping every few moments to look out over the hills, to try to grasp the
                           vastness of it all, or to take little side trips to see the graves or to explore the
                           dugouts on the side of the hill. We half walked, half tumbled, into those gruesome
                           caverns, feet down under the ground. Some were very large, with connecting rooms,
                           large enough each for fifteen or twenty men to sleep on cots, which were still there.
                           The old straw and mattresses were there, too, and the tables and shelves, and on one
                           of the shelves a bottle of Parisian perfume. At one place not very far from the top
                           of the hill was a sign, "Poste de Secours," outside of which were piles of all kinds
                           of old uniforms and cooking utensils, broken glass and equipment; inside a long table,
                           we imagined an operating table, and a few steps away from the entrance there was a
                           larger group of graves, one or two decorated with those wonderful French "couronnes,"
                           masterpieces of beadwork. Someone who cared had found them!

                           only their belts, boots and bones were left. All the time we had to pick our way along
                           very carefully. The ground was slippery, and the mud deep. The shell holes full of
                           water, deep enough to drown anyone with perfect ease, and the hand grenades and unexploded
                           shells were constantly under our feet. The grenades that were lying in the water on
                           the sides of shell holes looked like schools of fish taking a rest on the sides of
                           their pools. Tracks of the little railroad lower down than ours were torn up, twisted
                           and a complete wreck. The fascination of it all was wonderful.

                           of. I called in at the door and a nice soldier came out and said, certainly we could
                           enter, and he and a "sous-officier" showed us over the fort, took us into the officers'
                           rooms, gave us "pinar" (red wine) and hot coffee, allowed us to eat our luncheon there,
                           and were most cordial. I was surprised at the fewness of the guns in the fort, only
                           one big one and several seventy-fives. It may be that they didn't tell us or show
                           us all their secrets. The Germans had held that fort and Vaux for eight months, and
                           in one place a French shell had entered the fort during the German occupation and
                           twelve Germans are still buried in the débris. The top of the fort is in the same
                           shelled-to-pieces condition that the top of the citadel at Verdun is in. We could
                           look down into the valley and see the trenches where the Germans had been, their nearest
                           approach to Verdun.

                        <p id="d47486e3247">Our trip back was, to put it mildly, difficult. I suppose just what the boys have
                           had to endure for years. The rain was beating in our faces, our clothes were heavy
                           with water; I had on my uniform coat, my fur coat and raincoat, the two upper ones
                           soaked through. Then I had borrowed some big rubber boots from the head nurse in the
                           hospital. They wouldn't stay up, so after each step I had to give them a pull. Finally
                           they both sprang leaks and I had to walk in mud oozing up both inside and outside.
                           We didn't know our way, but we took what we thought the right direction, and luckily
                           it was. We trudged on for miles and miles. When anything on the side of the road looked
                           especially inviting, we took a look in. The rats which were exploring the dugouts
                           as we were
                           <add id="d47486e3249" hand="mh">,</add> made my hair stand on end when they jumped from one rattly thing to another suddenly.
                           Any noise in that stillness so far under ground was a little upsetting to the nerves,
                           and each time I got out safely I felt I had something to be thankful for. There were
                           trenches all along beside us, the little railroad on the down side of the road, and
                           on the upside, artillery emplacements. The back side of the hill was a choice place
                           for all purposes, for the enemy shells go over and seldom land there. Not a human
                           being was in sight to ask if we were right or wrong. Soon, though, as it began to
                           get dark and we began to get tired,—very,—a poilu appeared and told us it was about
                           seven kilometers more to Verdun and advised us to go a little out of our way to get
                           on to the Stenay road, where there was a chance of picking up a truck. The "little"
                           out of our way was miles out of our way, it <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3252"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span>seemed, and when we did reach the road we were both about 
                           <add id="d47486e3254" hand="mh">"</add>all in,
                           <add id="d47486e3257" hand="mh">"</add> but it was getting dark and I didn't dare to sit down and wait, so we crawled on.
                           In a few minutes I heard a toot behind me, and saw a little train going along through
                           the fields on a narrow gauge. It was impossible to get to, but in a second it turned,
                           crossed the road at our feet, and stopped for us to get on when I screamed "Verdun"
                           to the engineer. If our luck had deserted us then I doubt if you would ever have had
                           this letter. They dropped us not very far from the hospital, and every poilu I met
                           on the way back turned round as I passed and said, "Fatiguée, Mlle.?" and Mlle. gasped
                           back, "Boucoup fatiguée." Mrs. Earle seemed to have more lasting power than I, although
                           I passed my physical test A No. 1.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3262">The next day we beat our way down from Verdun to Bar-le-Duc. It took four different
                           conveyances to get us there, but we finally made it, thanks to a very kind American
                           officer, an hour after our train was supposed to have left, but not feeling at all
                           nervous, for we knew we were in plenty of time, and as it happened the 4.30 train
                           never did come. We left the station at 11 P.M. on another train entirely. That is
                           the way we travel here. If we hadn't told some American soldiers who were standing
                           that they could have our seats at Châlons, we should have gone on to Paris, because
                           we were both alseep. That's what happens to our boys; they ride up and down the tracks
                           until they happen to be awake at the place where they want to get out. We reached
                           Châlons at 2 A.M., went to the canteen for mail, and then to bed.

                        <p id="d47486e3267">From my letters I rather think you'll wonder whether I ever do any work. If I tell
                           you a little about the vicissitudes of life in the canteen after the armistice, I
                           hope you will realize that our difficulties were not our fault. We had hard and stormy
                           sailing for a while. Immediately the morale in the kitchen collapsed, servants didn't
                           care whether they did their work or not. Miss Nott, the directrice, was invited by
                           General Gouraud to open a little canteen at Strasbourg, so she and three of the oldest
                           and best workers accepted the invitation and left, and took with them on and off our
                           Lieutenant Robin, who is the one and only one who runs the "ravitaillment" of the
                           canteen. Nothing went here. Everything gave out; it just happened so. The coal wouldn't
                           burn, so we had scarcely any fire, and couldn't make soup. The meat gave out. The
                           chocolate gave out. The cheese gave out. Even the horse sausage gave out, and finally
                           the electric lights gave out and we had to pour coffee holding a candle in one hand
                           and the pitcher in the other. Think of me sometimes when you begin your luncheon at
                           one o'clock, at intervals through the afternoon, and again at seven after you have
                           finished your supper, standing always in the same place, always pouring coffee and
                           chocolate, sometimes both hands going at once, and often without time enough even
                           to push back my veil. Finally it got to a point where we wrung our hands in despair,
                           and then Miss Mitchell, the other directrice, went to Strasbourg for a visit, and
                           we were left to our own devices. Then our workers were grabbed away by the Paris office
                           for Germany, in twos, threes and fours, and the rest of us had to do extra work. Even
                           the poilus were different after the <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3269"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="152"> </a></span>armistice. Their morale had disappeared; they were rude, impatient and "zig zag,"
                           and it was discouraging to spend your hours waiting on drunks. (They are all right
                           again now). It seemed for a while that they were a different class of men.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3272">Then, too, one by one our canteen force of "militaire" were demobilized. We had had
                           the older men to help us in the canteen, and of course they went first, so we were
                           left with a constantly changing stream of new men in the kitchen, to start the fires,
                           fill our "marmites" and do the heavy work. That was charming for the kitchen women,
                           cooks and dishwashers, for it gave a new and varied crowd to flirt with each week,
                           and life never became dull for them except when we had to call for cups or spoons
                           or ask politely to have a "repas" handed out to us. Then the Misses Lansing came over
                           from Epernay and stole away from our apartment our own angel of a little Breton cook,
                           a most adorable little creature who always wore her Breton cap and what was still
                           better, a cheerful smile. On top of everything else, rumors began to fly around that
                           the canteen was to be closed, and there was the terrible question to decide in one's
                           own mind whether to try to grab another job before all the good ones were gone, or
                           to resign one's self to fate and stay on. Well, here I am, and things seem to be picking
                           up a bit. We have a fresh lot of workers from America, young and untrained, but at
                           least they lighten the work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3275">The most worrying thing of all at present is the attitude of our boys coming back
                           from Germany. They adore the Germans and hate the <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3277"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="205" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span>French. (Modify that sentence a bit, please). It is discouraging and alarming, and
                           makes me feel that we have made a great mistake to let our armies go into Germany,
                           especially the men who have not fought and have not seen the war. Nothing is too good
                           for the American boys. Instead of doubling the prices of things, as they say the French
                           have done, the Germans are halving them. The best the house contains is laid at their
                           feet. It is appalling, and makes me think that we have defeated our own ends and the
                           Germans are going to be the victors as far as we are concerned. They are devils, aren't
                           they? If they don't get you one way they will another. German prisoners who work at
                           the canteen are most pleasantly treated by the French, who, as a nation, are easy
                           going and don't carry their grudges very long. Those in the South will forget more
                           quickly than those in the North, who suffered more. The Germans say, "Just wait for
                           six years!" I think they have no intention of remaining a conquered nation longer
                           than that.

                           minutes I have to stop, go down on my hands and knees and blow it. Then there is a
                           weak blaze for a minute or two, two or three minutes of extreme nervousness on my
                           part for fear I'll lose my last red cinder, and then another frantic blow, so you
                           see I don't have much chance to put my mind on letter writing. It has been cold here,
                           even skating in the "Jard." The ground is covered with snow <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3290"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="206" data-tei-n="154"> </a></span>every morning, but that does not last. There is never sunshine. My feet are so cold
                           now that I'll have to put on arctics soon and my idea of cleanliness has been given
                           up long ago. I've stopped fighting and resigned myself to European ways. I rather
                           think everyone does in the end, only some admit it and some don't. Lately I've had
                           a rest from colds, but one is going through the canteen, and I'm having my turn at
                           it. I've hung on here much longer than some who come. The climate has been so bad
                           for three or four that they couldn't stay. If it were not for the question of losing
                           sleep the way I do, I'd be all right. Food costs so much it doesn't seem right to
                           eat. Meat outrageous, $1.50 a dozen for eggs; we have each had two to eat within two
                           weeks, a great luxury. They are the first I've had. If it weren't for the chocolate
                           at the canteen I think I'd die of starvation. We have food enough, but I don't think
                           it is of a nourishing nature. The chocolate, though, takes the place of anything we
                           lack. And when we couldn't get that, life was a different matter,—almost empty.

                        <p id="d47486e3293">Of late I haven't been far away from the canteen. We've seen our enormous naval guns
                           go down, taking up almost two cars for one gun, and some of the five thousand locomotives
                           which the Germans are obliged to give over to the French. The engineers who bring
                           them down come here for food, but we say, "Verboten." They should get it at the railroad
                           station, as it's the business of the government not the Red Cross to feed them. (Later
                           we were told to do it).

                           with our army. So many have already gone from here that I shall soon be the oldest
                           worker. I don't really want to leave France, either.

                           were.

                        <p id="d47486e3308">I talked to a poilu who was to be demobilized today, and remarked that he must be
                           very happy. "Not at all," he answered,—where would he get his food and his good clothes
                           now! I asked if he had any children and he said one, but he'd never have married if
                           he'd known what a trouble it would be.

                        <p id="d47486e3311">Sometimes now it is hard to tell when to sell tickets and when not to, as there are
                           frequently civilians who come in to try to buy our food. When I asked one of them
                           if he were "militaire," he said yes; yesterday he was here as a poilu, today he would
                           be discharged. I told him this would be his last canteen dinner, then, and he said
                           yes, but afterwards came back for another ticket, saying that as long as it was his
                           last chance, he'd make the best of it.

                           up on the platform to watch a long German train go through. Suppose the prisoners
                           at the canteen vow vengeance every time they see German trains go by, filled with
                           German ex-possessions. One was all flat cars with aeroplanes on them.

                           of a fire waiting for the water in my basin, in front of the fire also, to get warm
                           enough to put my hands in without weeping. Oh, it's so cold! Yesterday there were
                           icicles two inches long inside the window of our living-dining-room combination. It
                           is 
                           <hi id="d47486e3339" style="text-decoration: underline;">supposed</hi> to be warm, as it is next to the kitchen, and has a fire, such as it is, in the fireplace
                           all day long. Of course all the water in the pitchers is frozen. Work at the canteen
                           is piling up more and more, and as far as creature comforts go, there are none. I
                           notice the different workers growing darker complexioned daily, and have been fascinated
                           by the dimple in the cheek of one of the girls; each day it grows darker and darker,
                           and her neck matches it, but all around the front of her face, in a little circle
                           going in front of the ears and half way up the forehead and around the front part
                           of the chin, her complexion is fair. The rest is that of a very dark brunette. Her
                           aprons, veils, cuffs and collars are always immaculate, however. She probably has
                           the same decision to make that I do every morning. I use <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3342"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="210" data-tei-n="157"> </a></span>the water in my hot water bottle to wash my face, and more often than not find the
                           remains of the vegetables of the night before floating round in my basin. I always
                           look and hesitate before I make the plunge, but it's that or nothing, so in I go.
                           This life is not for the fastidious. When I get home I'm going to write an essay on
                           French plumbing as I've seen it. I've had one bath in a tub in five months. I know
                           now about that "downward path." You have to go through a certain amount of fight at
                           first, because being creatures of habit, it is hard to let the old ones go, but when
                           once you've been conquered, it's all up and you just sink lower and lower and lower
                           until life in the slums isn't in it compared to yours.

                           forward to tomorrow for breakfast, though—butter. Our little "femme-de-chambre" seems
                           to have a liking for me and has smuggled a pat of butter from somewhere for me to

                           so; pushing, flying wedging, elbowing and knocking each other out of the way; all
                           in good nature; screeching at me like crazy men, until I held my head in utter despair.
                           When one got his tickets, he would stoop down and make a dive out through the others'
                           legs somehow. There seems to be more room close to the floor. I had a new system of
                           tickets also, to try to keep straight.

                        <p id="d47486e3363">Yesterday Mrs. Earle and I talked to one of the German boys, and the lies they've
                           been told! That the French began the war; that the French began the gas; and thousands
                           of things like that; that the war was inevitable because all nations had been preparing
                           for it and it had to come. He is convinced that he will go home within a month or
                           two at most, or else the war will begin again. Germany 
                           <hi id="d47486e3365" style="text-decoration: underline;">will</hi> have her prisoners back, he says. He's a nice, industrious boy, but 
                           <hi id="d47486e3368" style="text-decoration: underline;">German</hi>, and they never can be changed; they will always wish to push their Kultur onto others.
                           He told us their government was the best, and we'd all have to come to it sooner or
                           later. I really felt quite hopeless after I'd talked to him. There is one prisoner
                           in their barracks who speaks French well; he reads the papers to the crowds and they
                           put their German interpretation into the articles and can see nothing as it really
                           is. Otto said it made his "heart bleed" to see the ruin in France.

                           guard home with me to protect me from the guards. They are awful looking men, and
                           when they come to the canteen and try to get tickets, it is beyond description. They
                           helped to wear me out last week. We couldn't strike any words in any language which
                           conveyed anything to our minds; even signs failed to please them, so I used to give
                           up in despair and ask the French what they wanted, who invariably answered, "Oh, they
                           don't know what they want," and passed on. I'll be glad when they go and we get another
                           detachment. The town is full of them, picturesque as the Old Nick in colors and everything
                           else, a perfect feast for the eyes, but not for the nose. I watched for a long time
                           an old man who came down the street with his head all done up in some kind of cloth,
                           his brown steel helmet sitting far up on top, his greenish brown camels' hair cloak,
                           with red stitchings, over his brown clothes, and his whole equipment—brown—packed
                           high on his back. He stopped beside an old brown fence to talk to some friends (dressed
                           the same) standing down below the brown bank, under brownish green trees, the most
                           perfect color scheme, without a single false note anywhere to be seen. If I were only

                           don't come up. You've never seen anything like the types here. No one could ever imagine
                           it, and each day I feel more what a crime it is to let such opportunities slip by.
                           In our country character does not show in the face as it does here; we don't have
                           the distinct types.

                        <p id="d47486e3414">A week ago Sunday Mrs. Earle, Mrs. Richard Mansfield and I went to Rheims. There were
                           Algerians quartered in all the towns we passed through. It was one of the coldest
                           days of the winter and the poor things looked perished. In Rheims we went through
                           the usual amount of talk necessary to get the guardian to open the door of the cathedral.
                           I've always had a sneaking desire to climb up into one of the towers. "Défendu," I
                           suppose, but as I passed by, the door was there, and I was there, and no one was looking,
                           so I "entréed" and "montéed." Why not?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3417">It seemed as though we must have met all the artillery in France that day on the road.
                           The country was covered with snow, and I tried to take some pictures, but my rubber
                           bulb was so frozen that it wouldn't squeeze, and my hands so cold that they wouldn't
                           work, and my feet so cold that they wouldn't take me where I wanted to go, so I'm
                           afraid I didn't get much. We went out to German lines we had not seen before, where
                           there were more concrete dugouts and Red Cross quarters, wonderfully steeled and concreted.
                           The trenches are being filled up as quickly as possible; soon there will be none left.
                           One of the things most wearing to me is the desire to get out to take pictures, and
                           the impossibility of doing it. I know I could get such wonderful things.

                        <p id="d47486e3432">The other day the Châlons regiment came home. Everyone was out on the streets to greet
                           them. It was rumored that Pétain was to be here, but I didn't see him. The General
                           of the Sixth Army and his staff rode by us on their way out to welcome the regiment,
                           the 106th Infantry and 25th Artillery. As they marched into Châlons with their band
                           playing, there were met with a deadly silence; not a cheer, no clapping of hands,—nothing.
                           Some had big bunches of flowers and some little bunches, but that was all. Twenty-eight
                           men, all who were left of the original regiment, marched alone behind the music, and
                           the only sounds heard in the streets were sobs. I think it was the saddest thing I've
                           ever seen. The husbands of our two maids were in the regiment, but did not come back.
                           The women were wonderful in their self control. The regiment marched up to the Hotel-de-Ville,
                           where many generals and officials had assembled, and were officially welcomed, after
                           which the band played and they all, infantry and artillery, marched around the square
                           and off to their barracks. The next night there was a torchlight procession, which
                           I missed.

                        <p id="d47486e3435">That day I had an awful decision to make, whether to go up the Marne on an English
                           submarine chaser as far as Vitry-le-François or to go to the Argonne. I chose the
                           Argonne. I had been on the English boats several times, to tea, etc., and knew the
                           river more or less from the train, and although it would have been a fine trip, I

                           nice and entertaining. They had all chased submarines for years, and some had never
                           seen one at all. I doubt if as many were captured as we were led to believe. They
                           had an awful time coming up the Marne, because they couldn't go slowly enough to make
                           the turns in the river, and were continually getting smashed up.

                        <p id="d47486e3456">Mrs. Earle had asked the M.P. to let her know if a car was going up to the Argonne,
                           and that morning the sergeant came flying down to the canteen while I was there, to
                           say that a seven-passenger Fiat would call for us in fifteen minutes. She had already
                           gone on board the boat, so I took Mme. Oblin with me, and we had a wonderful trip
                           as far as Monfaucon, through all the country our boys had fought in so hard. Some
                           of the hillsides were like little checkerboards where the individual men had dug themselves
                           in. The towns are utterly destroyed and deserted. Monfaucon is wonderfully situated
                           on a high hill. Nothing remains but ruins, and under them the German shelters where
                           they lived. They say that Verdun quivered all the time the Americans were bombarding
                           it. We did our work well. The officer we were with went up to hunt for his cousin's
                           grave, but we could not reach the town where it was, as the roads were so bad. We
                           were fortunate in having four big strong American men in our car, for otherwise we'd
                           still be up there stuck in the mud. One spring was all but gone when we reached Châlons.
                           The whole country is absolutely deserted and I can't tell you how charmed I was to
                           get a chance to see it. We were gone all day. Luckily I thought of taking <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3458"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="220" data-tei-n="163"> </a></span>a loaf of bread, a box of paté and some chocolate; otherwise we'd have had nothing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3461">Once in a while I am invited out to dinner at the hotel, which is a pleasant diversion.
                           My French never improves; it gets worse. Sometimes one of the German prisoners comes
                           up to do some work in my room, and I try to talk to him, and after 
                           <hi id="d47486e3463" style="text-decoration: underline;">that</hi> I'm dumb, for I can't think of any word in any language. Lately I've had a variety
                           of Poles brought to me in the canteen, as I was the only one on the shift who understood
                           German and I had to get them straightened out. Great big Russians come, too, sometimes,
                           and I try to help them, for they often know more German than French.

                        <p id="d47486e3468">Our German prisoners say that Germany will always be a republic now, but they say
                           anything they happen to think wise at the moment, I guess.

                           dollars a day! It was impossible to rest in Châlons. I had morning work the week the
                           clock changed, so it really got me up every morning about 5.30, and that, together
                           with my cold, made me a perfect wreck, and ready for my permission, which was due.

                        <p id="d47486e3491">Paris offered nothing but exertion and annoyance, because of the crowds and discomforts,
                           so I decided to take a chance and turned to <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3493"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="221" data-tei-n="164"> </a></span>ex-Bocheland, feeling sure I could get here the creature comforts I want. I came with
                           Mme. Oblin, who is at this moment entertaining French generals, while I am just as
                           happy staying in bed, gazing into my tiled bathroom.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3496">We spent the first night at Nancy, at the Red Cross Officers' hotel. They have taken
                           the best hotel in the place for officers, and won't allow a Red Cross woman a room
                           by herself; we must sleep in dormitories. It is quite a fascinating place,—"Little
                           Paris," they call it. It has been bombed but none of the valuable old buildings destroyed.
                           The next day we went to Metz. Had to stand up all the way in the train, while all
                           the French officers who could get seats had them. I didn't care, but Mme. Oblin was
                           worn out, after her four years' nursing and canteen work, and looked so tired that
                           two American officers spoke about it. French officers—some of them—certainly aren't
                           what they are cracked up to be as far as manners are concerned. The train crawled
                           along, so we could see the trenches and battle lines very well. I had had Metz put
                           on my travelling order, luckily, for I knew it was forbidden to Americans. I had also
                           bought a military ticket, two dollars from Châlons to Strasbourg, but not by way of
                           Metz. Mme. Oblin's pass didn't take her that way, either, so we had quite a lot of
                           fun travelling ticketless and passless. We wore our veils and went out the military
                           exits, and when a Boche started to object a poilu spoke up with great indignation
                           and said, "Infirmières," so out we went. We found a good room at the hotel, and then
                           went out to

                        <p id="d47486e3533">When we sat down to dinner that evening, the waiter and proprietor both rushed up
                           and asked me for my ticket. I said I hadn't any. They told me it would be impossible
                           to have dinner without one; that they had not known I was American until they read
                           my registration after I left the hotel that afternoon, and that I must get a ticket
                           from the M.P. in order to eat or sleep in the place. I was almost dead, and told them
                           I wouldn't move until I had eaten, and finally they served my dinner, after which
                           I went out on the street, picked up the first M.P. I came across, and told him I wanted
                           a pass for the place. He took me to the Provost Marshal's office; I showed my papers—nobody
                           understood them—and they asked if I were attached to the French army. I thought it
                           would simplify things to say yes, and after more talk between themselves, they handed
                           out my permission to eat, sleep and walk around the town. It's interesting there,
                           and we had a beautiful day. We went to see the cathedral where Kaiser Wilhelm had
                           had the head of one of the statues removed and his own put in its place. His hands
                           are at present chained together with iron chains.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3536">The next day we went to the Bureau de la Place, and boldly asked the French army to
                           telephone to Strasbourg for a room for me. While we were waiting there a regular Boche,
                           who had been arrested, was brought in and questioned. He was more sullen than I've
                           ever seen anyone before.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3539">We had to beat the railroad again, having no tickets, so we put on our veils and entered
                           the station through the "sortie" as though we <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3541"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="224" data-tei-n="166"> </a></span>did it every day. No one peeped. While we were waiting, Mme. Oblin saw Miss Nott and
                           Miss Mitchell pass by. I felt like a truant anyway, leaving work, and Mme. Oblin also
                           was expected straight through from Châlons, so we were rather taken aback when we
                           were caught in the act of detouring a little.

                        <p id="d47486e3544">We went through parts of the Vosges Mountains, which were lovely. The French are keeping
                           Alsace and Lorraine for themselves. Americans aren't allowed here, so I may be really
                           safer in my bed than out of it. I wasn't wrong in my idea that I'd find creature comforts
                           here in Strasbourg. I've got the cleanest room and most immaculate linen, and a spotless
                           bathroom with all the most modern appliances, a maid to run in at any moment, and
                           a waiter at table to put everything on my plate, so my exertions are reduced to a
                           minimum.

                        <p id="d47486e3547">Last night while I was making arrangements for my room, I heard a band out in the
                           square. It played "Madelon
                           <add id="d47486e3549" hand="mh">,</add>" and the proprietor was left talking to himself until the excitement was over. I
                           didn't even have time to say I was going. Such a mob as there was! Cavalry first,
                           to clear the way, then the band, and more cavalry, and then crowds and crowds and
                           crowds following on. This hotel was the worst old Boche place in Alsace. None of the
                           real Alsatians had ever stepped inside it until after the armistice. During the war
                           it was practically an officers' club.

                        <p id="d47486e3554">It makes me mad to hear German all about, and French with that awful staccato Boche
                           accent is even worse than pure German. There are <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3556"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="167"> </a></span>over twenty thousand real Germans here still, although crowds have left. It's easy
                           to tell a German soldier even without his uniform.

                           whether I can make it. I can get on the train all right here, because Mme. de la Croix
                           (Mme. Oblin's cousin) knows the Commissaire de Gare, but how the Boche and the American
                           M.P.s will be at the other end, I don't know. (The Germans are running the railroads).
                           All the M.P.s I know have told me to try it. Mme. Oblin will, I hope, go with me.

                        <p id="d47486e3562">I spent four dollars on twenty-three books today, and Heaven only knows what I'll
                           do with them. They were on the counter of a shop where I went to get postcards. A
                           collection of little books made by a Mme. Dufrenoy in 1818, to show that women in
                           order to be good wives ought to be able to talk about a little something with their
                           husbands. They are quite interesting and I've looked for them in the New York library
                           when I was doing suffrage work. I travel with that knapsack I brought from home and
                           another I borrow from Miss Coryn, hung over my back like a poilu, but now with my
                           twenty-three books, too, I'll have a harder time, I imagine.

                        <p id="d47486e3565">I asked the chambermaid if she saw the Germans go out of Alsace and she said yes,
                           that they looked very sad, and the officers, who were usually so proud, hung their
                           heads. I'm enclosing some Alsace Lorraine money which I think rather interesting.
                           The question is whether if they were to make it themselves now, they would have such
                           pleased expressions on their faces. The inevitable grumbling has begun.

                        <p id="d47486e3570">I am waiting for Mme. Oblin to come in, as we are going to the Bureau of Circulation
                           to see if we can get papers to circulate in the zones of the Armies of Occupation.
                           General opinion seems to be that it will be harder for me to get them than for her.

                        <p id="d47486e3574">It's snowing now, but the trees are coming out. They don't seem to wait for warm days,
                           as ours do. The town, or rather city, for it's very big, and all except the old part
                           very modern and comfortable, tries to be entirely French. On the great majority of
                           shop windows are signs saying "Maison Française," but on the streets we sometimes
                           have difficulty in finding people who speak French, and I can't always understand
                           their Alsatian German. There are a great many women who still wear the native costume,
                           some of them very elaborate.

                        <p id="d47486e3577">The servants here, being of Alsace and Lorraine, were immediately demobilized from
                           the German army after the armistice. It's a good time to be in hotels because the
                           waiters have new, spotless dress suits. One of them told me that they had been sent
                           to Russia, where many thousands were smothered in the snow; they went to sleep, and
                           being too tired to wake up, were never found until spring.

                        <p id="d47486e3580">It is strange to be in this city which has been the centre of so long a controversy
                           and to find it calm and untouched. It is now filled with the French army, and it is
                           hard to realize that only a few months ago it was the headquarters of the army of
                           the Kaiser's third son. He lived here all the time, occasionally taking an afternoon
                           trip towards the lines to see if his army were still there. He never spent a night
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3582"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="227" data-tei-n="169"> </a></span>there, and when Miss Nott asked why not, she was told that he thought the trenches
                           a very dangerous place. He spent much time here in revelry, as did all the German
                           officers. The elevator boy can't stop talking when he once begins to describe them
                           and their ways. He says that iron crosses were given for favors done behind the lines,
                           such as stealing for their officers, treasures from French villages, to send back
                           to their friends at home.

                        <p id="d47486e3592">We were ready to leave Strasbourg without passes, for we were asked to go to a canteen
                           at St. Wendell, where help was needed. At the station Mme. Oblin met a friend, Capt.
                           de la Giclais, who is stationed near St. Wendell, who told us to wait and go up with
                           him next morning, which we thought better, as it was to be our real enterance into
                           Bocheland. That evening, however, our passes came,—sent to us by General Gouraud by
                           private messenger from his headquarters at Colmar. Capt. de la Giclais, who is of
                           the family who owned much property in the Place Vendôme, induced us to lunch with
                           him at Homburg. He gave us delicious butter, and said the weekly butter box from home
                           had never failed to reach him during the four years of war. Pretty good record for
                           French mails!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3595">We arrived at St. Wendell at about seven, requisitioned rooms in the hotel, ate at
                           the officers' "popote," and were taken to drive by the French officers through beautiful
                           woods the next afternoon. Our work at the canteen consisted of standing around for
                           ten minutes.

                        <p id="d47486e3600">On Sunday Miss Nott and Mrs. Francis came up from Strasbourg to see Capt. de la Giclais.
                           He sent over for us, too, so we went to Homburg, slept in more requisitioned rooms,
                           and dined most formally and stylishly with the Colonel. The next day we all escorted
                           Miss Nott and Mrs. Francis back over the French border, in a powerful automobile,
                           lunched again with Capt. de la Giclais, and went back to St. Wendell late in the afternoon.
                           By that time I was a complete wreck and had to go to bed immediately, dinnerless,
                           exhausted by life in the French army.

                        <p id="d47486e3604">The next morning we took a train for Mainz and then a tram over here. We arrived too
                           late for any of the festivities in the Kursal, so stayed over today. If I didn't hate
                           to give the Boches my money, and also if I had any to spare, I'd make a few purchases;
                           the mark is worth one half a franc exactly, so you can imagine the bargains there
                           are here.

                        <p id="d47486e3607">Talk about the Germans being starved and miserable! I've looked carefully in every
                           village and place I've been, and see no signs of misery. The shops are fine, the people
                           well fed and well dressed and well booted, and twice as well cared for as many of
                           the people in France. And now we talk about feeding the Germans! The idea of saying
                           they are becoming degenerate because of lack of food! Plenty of people are vegetarians
                           and aren't degenerate. Their bread isn't much, I guess; neither has ours been anything
                           very fancy lately. Of course, I'm only judging from appearances.

                        <p id="d47486e3612">The German army seems to be demobilizing. At the railroad stations there are crowds
                           of returning soldiers, in uniforms with the military buttons cut off. It's not a very
                           savory looking crowd of men. You've never seen anything like the children here; every
                           place simply crawling with them. Mother and I have never been in the dirty little
                           German villages during our travels. They are awful and I'm so sorry for the men who
                           have to be quartered there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3615">We never pay any railroad fares in Germany; we're not supposed to. Never pay for any
                           hotel rooms, either; not supposed to. Here we went to the Bureau de la Place, signed
                           up, and were given orders for rooms at the Palace Hotel. We have our bathroom, with
                           mineral water baths, even. It's very chic! And will spoil me for other kinds of travel.

                        <p id="d47486e3618">Tonight we've been to "Butterfly" given in German, beautifully staged, beautifully
                           sung, and the house full of German women handsomely dressed, and Allied officers of
                           all nations. Tomorrow we start at eight o'clock, and go either to Cologne or Coblenz;
                           haven't decided which. After this life of luxury, I don't know what Châlons and its
                           squalor will seem like. My cold is not well, but my cough is; can't smell any or taste
                           much.

                        <p id="d47486e3622">The Boche nurses aren't a bit attractive. There were two very fashionable French ones
                           at the Kursal, sitting almost next to two awful looking Germans, and it was interesting
                           to see the difference. At St. Wendell we went to the moving pictures one night, and
                           saw a French <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3624"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="230" data-tei-n="172"> </a></span>film, and after that a German one which was very coarse. I'll be glad to get with
                           English speaking people tomorrow, and let Mme. Oblin take her turn at being tired.
                           She can't speak a word of English, and I'm worn out speaking bad French.

                           have been asked. I'll have a harder time with the American M. P. than I've had here,
                           but my French papers ought to take me along. So far I've only had to show them, to
                           get a free room here. Think how the people must hate us. All civilians have to be
                           in the house at 11 P.M.

                        <p id="d47486e3630">Don't think of anything else to tell you now. Have no papers for Cologne, but shall
                           try our luck with the English army. This is a fine place for the men quartered here;
                           always something to do,—morning and afternoon concerts, theatre and opera in the evening.
                           It's as cold as winter. Snowed every day at Strasbourg and St. Wendell and is icy
                           here.

                           the river than on the Coblenz side, and I had no difficulty as they accepted my French

                        <p id="d47486e3660">We found our billeting officers not nearly as cordial as the French. They instructed
                           us to leave town as soon as possible, and would only give us a room until Saturday
                           evening—two nights—because all the American officers from the country about come down
                           to Coblenz to spend Sunday and must have rooms. After we were settled at a horrid
                           hotel, where there were no maids, only German men provided to take care of the rooms,
                           we went to hunt up Miss Worthington at the Red Cross canteen in the station. Miss

                           rest away from the social whirl of the Treves canteen, so we all four went across
                           the Rhine in the afternoon to Ehrenbreitstein in a one horse cab. Luckily we found
                           an American truck to take us up the hill. As we were looking at the view of the country,
                           and feasting our eyes on the Stars and Stripes flying over the Rhine, some officers
                           came up, and with no ceremony whatever, invited us to a dance that evening. Evidently
                           there were to be several rival dances, for they appeared <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3668"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="233" data-tei-n="174"> </a></span>much afraid that we might be grabbed up and taken elsewhere. I don't suppose there
                           are girls enough to go around, so there is great anxiety on the part of the promoters

                           came for us promptly at eight. Mme. Oblin found some American women at the dance whom
                           she used to know at Epernay.

                           Cologne. It seemed better to work through the French, as my papers were French, and
                           they are more polite than Americans are. They sent my papers to the American authorities
                           and got them back in time for us to catch the Cologne train. An American M.P. wanted
                           to throw me out bodily, saying my papers were no good. I told him I had spent all
                           the morning having them stamped and made correct and I had no intention of getting
                           out, so sat down in my seat, and finally he went off.

                           We went to the Cathedral and St. Ursula, ate luncheon at the Officers' Club, and stared
                           at the Scotch officers to see how they arranged their skirts when they sit down. After
                           lunch, sight-saw, and went back to the Club for tea. They were all most polite to
                           us. Perhaps they were glad to see a woman or two, as there was not an English woman
                           anywhere about. Somewhat different <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3679"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="234" data-tei-n="175"> </a></span>from our zone! Went back on a late afternoon train. Some American nurses were in our
                           compartment, and one of them soon after we started invited a nice American boy to
                           "pet her." He had no idea of "petting" before, but accepted the invitation, and they
                           went away from the station in Coblenz arm in arm.

                           the food at the canteen is delicious, like our own most elaborate afternoon tea parties.
                           Too much pampering of the boys, I think. In Germany all the Red Cross food is given
                           away, which seems foolish, as it only gives the boys more money to spend among the

                           That evening we had to escape the M.P.s at the station, so Miss Pond escorted us to

                           was said, however, no matter how much was thought. Found Châlons cold and covered
                           with snow and ice, with no signs of spring, and half an inch of mould on everything
                           in my room. It snowed part of almost every day we were away, but in spite of the bad

                           interesting, and the work is more like drudgery than ever before. We go often to the
                           war hospitals near here, to take food and cigarettes to the blessés. On Easter we
                           piled a camionette full, and each patient in Corbineau had quite a variety of little
                           presents. We each had different things to give, and for the men who were out of their
                           wards at the time, we left little piles, which looked very gay arranged prettily on
                           the tables.

                           all other American organizations pour in. We hear all kinds of talk and opinions,
                           many very annoying, especially when our boys attack the "Frogs." There is an element

                           in. They forget that private property was none too safe in our own camps at home,
                           and seem to think that the French are the only ones who

                           on his arm, a most ridiculous looking affair, so wiggly, just like himself. There
                           is one man, very sleek in a dress suit and large boutoniËre who sings songs, serious
                           and sentimental. He furnishes the classical part of the entertainment. Then there
                           is a "Raconteur," who tells tales always beyond the limit, which never fail to bring
                           a "C'est un peu trop fort" from Mme. Oblin. I am spared the shocks which the French
                           and the <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3793"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="241" data-tei-n="180"> </a></span>accomplished Americans receive during his contribution to the evening entertainment.
                           Most important of all the troupe is the soprano—the prima donna. He is dressed in
                           the conventional opera singer décolleté and sings the soprano arias quite as well
                           as the ordinary operatic soprano. He is easily the favorite and his voice and feminine
                           charm always win for him wild applause. On or off the stage he never loses the mannerisms
                           of the grand prima donna. Whenever we see a poilu walking down the street with a ladylike
                           switch to the tail of his horizon blue overcoat, we recognize our friend of the opera
                           troupe. There is always a small stringed orchestra which accompanies the performers,
                           and a brass band, which plays one or two rousing good marches during the show, with
                           "Madelon" in between, so the audience may take its turn also.

                        <p id="d47486e3797">Other evenings there are moving pictures in the cinema room, but I almost never go
                           to those. We take turns going to the vaudeville when we are on evening duty and business
                           is quiet. Some of us go to the first half of the performance and some to the last
                           half,—except those who "forget" (!) and stay for the whole of it.

                        <p id="d47486e3832">I have been off on another little trip up to Verdun and the Argonne with Frances King.
                           I wanted to take some pictures, so I asked Miss Mitchell if I might hire as a substitute
                           a French woman who has worked a long time in the canteen. She agreed to let me, so
                           the end of April we started off for Verdun in the early train, 6.30 A.M. Went directly
                           to the Y.M.C.A. to engage cots, as it is the only place where one can eat or sleep
                           in Verdun. There were about sixty in the dormitory, some already occupied by nurses
                           stretched out on them even then. There were two or three dirty looking wash basins
                           on tables, and the whole thing seemed too messy to endure, so we made for Glorieux
                           Hospital. There we found only twelve or fourteen cots in the visitors' room, taken
                           mostly by French nurses. It was as cold and cheerless as when I was there before.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3835">The next morning we went out to Douaumont, standing up in the Y.M.C.A. truck, bumped
                           about and blown to bits by a frightfully piercing wind, which hurled snow and hail
                           into our faces until we could see nothing. There was such a crowd with us, that F.
                           King and I decided to leave them and walk to Vaux alone, through the shell holes.
                           I found my adjutant friend in Douaumont, who remembered me quite well, gave us more
                           coffee and wine, and showed us the direction to take for Fort Vaux. Luckily the sun
                           came out, and it grew warmer. The walk from one fort to the other was the most thrilling
                           I've had. The battlefield was covered with violets, great, big, wonderful ones,

                           path. At one place there seemed to be a skeleton in every shell hole. I think we saw
                           dozens of them. We explored all the dugouts we came to, found some very deep ones
                           made entirely of concrete, with double walls of concrete sometimes. In one I found
                           posted the directions for a telephone operator in case of gas alarms. There was furniture
                           and beds—springs on wooden supports—in all of the dugouts, and all kinds of ammunition
                           lying about, which made our walk in the dark a little nerve racking. We crossed Death
                           Valley on some boards, and then started up the hill towards Fort Vaux, getting mixed
                           up in barbed wire more or less all the way.

                        <p id="d47486e3856">Fort Vaux is more interesting than Douaumont. It took the Germans seven days, I think,
                           to take that fort, and we saw quite plainly where they had fought in the narrow underground
                           passageways. There are holes in the sides of the walls made by hand grenades and the
                           bullets from machine guns, which the French had placed behind steel screens in order
                           to guard the ends of the passages. The French only surrendered because of lack of
                           water and because of the stench of the dead, whom they had put in a room far down
                           in the fort, being unable to get them out.

                        <p id="d47486e3859">M.P. Baker was to meet us at Vaux at four o'clock, but as we did not get there until
                           six, he had given us up and gone back. We thought we never could make Verdun on foot,
                           but walked almost in before we were picked up by some poilus and driven into the city.

                           take Verdun was the next most interesting trip near by, so we joined the Y.M.C.A.
                           party and went out there the next morning. We each had our own candle, and walked
                           through the whole length of the hill underground. It was a little muddy in spots,
                           but while the Germans were living there it was kept in perfect condition. Besides
                           the rooms, which were large sleeping quarters, there were shelves all along the sides
                           of the main tunnel, where many men could sleep if necessary. In the middle of the
                           tunnel there was a big concrete engine room, with American engines still there, and
                           a large concrete bathroom filled with shower baths, etc. Thousands of men could have
                           lived in that tunnel, ready to march on Verdun when the time came. We ate our luncheon
                           when we came out at the other end. Took a picture, but the weather was no good for
                           pictures. Wandered round the hill, and back to the "town," to catch the train. The
                           town doesn't exist, so you have to guess where the train will stop.

                           roads were awful and when we reached Varennes, he did not dare to take us farther,
                           so the Y.M.C.A. girls put us up for the night and we ate at an officers' mess. About
                           ten of us slept in one room that night and I guess I was the only warm one. Every
                           one else seemed to have suffered agonies, but I can keep warmer asleep than awake,
                           I find. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3924">We had breakfast at the officers' mess, and one of them found us transportation to
                           Romagne in an ambulance. When we got to the outskirts of the American camp there,
                           our driver was held up by M.P.s, so we hopped quickly out and walked right along as
                           though we knew exactly where we were going. Finally a Cadillac stopped near us and
                           a grand officer asked if we'd like a lift. In we piled. He seemed interested to know
                           how we had gotten into the camp, and said we had no right to be there, but as long
                           as we were, that we might as well wait until we were put out. He thought, though,
                           that the commanding officer would not allow us to stay. He seemed very agreeable and
                           left us at the Y.M.C.A. There we told our tale, how we had come up to the camp not
                           suspecting for a moment that it was forbidden ground. A nice lieutenant who happened
                           to be there, and a Y.M.C.A. man, held a conference. One said he would feed us if the
                           other would sleep us, and it was finally arranged that we were to sleep in the Y.M.C.A.
                           quarters in town outside the camp, and were to go to the lieutenant's tent for food.
                           Then the great question of how <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3926"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="252" data-tei-n="185"> </a></span> to stay at all without permission was discussed, and we decided to face the music
                           and go to the Major ourselves to ask for passes. It appears that a good many women
                           had been up there, watched the men bringing in the bodies, and went away with sensational
                           tales about how few were really being identified, etc., which the officers said were
                           quite untrue.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3929">The nice lieutenant took us to the Major. We explained that we had come up to see
                           the Argonne and Madeleine Farm, especially, and not the cemetery. After a few moments
                           of silence and serious thought, probably to impress us with his importance and our
                           sin, he remarked that the country was much too dangerous, too many colored troops
                           in the vicinity for us to wander about in alone. So he asked our lieutenant if he
                           could take the day off. "I don't detail you, only request it," he said, with a smile.
                           We thanked him and went with the lieutenant to his tent, where he and some friends
                           gave us a fine dinner, cooked by a darky cook and served by the darky orderly.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3932">After dinner the officers took us all around the country there, and we got a fine
                           idea of a battlefield quite unsalvaged. There were dead horses about, and still men
                           unburied. I never thought I could look at stray legs without collapsing, but I can.
                           Boots with feet in them are so common that you never think anything about them, and
                           it is not at all unusual to see German boots sticking out of the ground and know that
                           the rest of him is only an inch or two down.

                        <p id="d47486e3947">Very hard fighting had taken place around Madeleine Farm. The Germans had apparently
                           used the house as a club. There were evidences of great luxury—panelled walls, comfortable
                           corner seats, a bar, etc. Back in the woods they had the sweetest little bungalos,
                           with pianos, porcelain bathtubs, electric lights, and concrete walks. I can't think
                           of anything nicer than to take a camping trip through there and live in those rustic
                           camps. Outside each house there's a shelter dug deep under ground, and on top of the
                           ground, piles of German ammunition of every variety.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3950">The men threw hand grenades for us, one potato masher caught in a tree, and they screamed
                           to us to drop, which we did in a hurry. Then they tried setting off all sorts of queer
                           smoke things. One they thought was gas, and I must say I was glad when they stopped
                           experimenting. Brought back a little shell with a parachute in it. Hope it is nothing
                           more dangerous than a smoke screen.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3953">All around the outskirts of the woods were shallow trenches where the Germans had
                           hidden to fire on us. They were in the same mess they left them in, everything thrown
                           around, old helmets, uniforms, guns, etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3956">We saw the "digging up" squad at work in the distance. Each squad starts out with
                           a truck load of six coffins (made by German prisoners) in the morning, and when they
                           are filled, go back, line up beside a long platform, and unload. There a crowd of
                           undertakers with rubber gloves on are waiting to identify the bodies. They say ninety-nine
                           per cent. are identified correctly. It is most <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3958"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="255" data-tei-n="187"> </a></span> unpleasant to meet the trucks on their return trips. I believe there are sixty of
                           them already in use and sixty more expected soon.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3962">The officers led us back through the cemetery. They said it was not allowed, but they
                           took us right along. We had to walk on narrow ridges between the trenches, some of
                           which were already filled with coffins not yet covered. It was as much as I could
                           do not to slip into the holes myself.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3965">The trucks were all back when we reached the camp and the men on the platform were
                           working intently. Those who had been identified were being carried up to the trenches
                           by four colored men each. All night long and every night that goes on. I don't know
                           how people live breathing that air. The poor darky soldiers must have been ready to
                           give up the ghost when they were landed in that place. Our guides rather wanted us
                           to watch some being identified, but naturally we wouldn't. (I've seen some women who
                           watched four or five coffins opened and the bodies searched).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3968">The officers gave us a good supper and then handed us over to the Y.M.C.A. man, who
                           took us to our quarters. By the time we got there a raging blizzard was in full blast.
                           In a room down stairs there was a small stove surrounded by the usual big strong Y.M.C.A.
                           men. We were taken to a room upstairs. It looked as though it had not been cleaned
                           since the war. There were bloody cloths in the fireplace, an old German canteen in
                           one corner and an American in another. We were thankful to see only two cots in the
                           room. Our host hustled <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e3970"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="256" data-tei-n="188"> </a></span>round, brought us blankets, a small wash basin and some water, and told us not to
                           feel nervous, for we should be safe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3973">After he left we looked about. Water was dripping down from the roof, snow was blowing
                           in drifts through some old burlap which had been nailed up to make a wall on one side
                           of the room. The only thing which suggested comfort was the stovepipe, which came
                           up from the stove below through a hole cut in the floor, so we pulled our cots as
                           near that as possible and sat with our feet over the hole in hopes we cold get a little
                           warm before we turned in for the night. At least we were alone; that was a comfort
                           and a luxury. Whenever I woke that night, which was often, I heard the white guard
                           walking up and down in front of our room.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e3976">The next morning we breakfasted in our officer's tent on good coffee and

                           crowds of prisoners with all their baggage on their backs going down to the station.
                           I wish I could have seen the 26th Division come home. I'm awfully sorry about the
                           friction between the French and the Americans since the Armistice, and the tales our
                           boys are taking home. You'll hear a great deal of criticism of the French, some just,
                           but much unjust and undeserved. When you hear it, put America in the same place that
                           France was in when we came over here,—worn out with war, discouraged, many of the
                           soldiers not knowing what had become of their homes or families, with no news of them
                           for three years; thousands with their little fortunes absolutely wiped out; refugees
                           settled down on the people all through the uninvaded country, putting an extra burden
                           on the already over-burdened population there; families having to cope with the hardships,
                           the sorrows and constant suspense of not knowing what was happening, and being at
                           the mercy, more or less, of that class of people who always make their fortunes out
                           of the helplessness of others, the profiteers. You know we have plenty of them in
                           our own country, as it is, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4001"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="258" data-tei-n="190"> </a></span> and think how the numbers would grow with a chance such as they have had here in
                           France, with so many foreign armies among them, millionaires compared to their own
                           soldiers, who earn now five cents a day. The minute our armies moved into any new
                           places at home, prices began to go up, and the same happened here, often two prices,
                           one for the Americans and one for the French, but in New York if I trade on Second

                           don't you think so? It was the same here. They thought the Americans could pay, therefore
                           why not let them, and the good class of French people fought it. Profiteers have been
                           put in prison for doing it, but a thing like that is almost impossible to prevent,
                           either in America or France, and the French Army and French nation criticize very
                           severely those French civilians who have used the war and the soldiers of all armies
                           for their personal advantage.

                        <p id="d47486e4004">Then very few of our boys have had the opportunity of meeting the French people of
                           the better classes. As a nation they are conservative, and the women and girls our
                           boys have been thrown with on the streets are the same class as the girls they meet
                           that way at home. I think I have never heard one of our boys who has been attached
                           to the French army say a disagreeable thing about the poilus or the French officers.
                           They have learned to know their customs, and more or less of their language, are able
                           to understand what they say, and therefore do not misunderstand them or their motives
                           or manners. One day I heard a French soldier make a pleasant little remark to an <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4006"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="259" data-tei-n="191"> </a></span>American when I was selling them meal tickets, and the American shoved him out of
                           the way with his elbow, growling, "Get out of the way, you frog!" The poilu looked
                           at him with utter amazement, and I felt my face flush with mortification and shame.
                           I've wanted and longed so much to have our fine army leave a wonderful impression
                           here in France, but I'm afraid it's the little things like that which have prevented
                           any very close sympathy between the nations. Americans say the French soldiers are
                           robbers, but what about our own boys in our own training camps before they came over?
                           Did they dare to leave anything they valued about? An American officer came down here
                           from Rheims the other day and said that he had left all his valuable clothes, rugs,
                           etc., with some German prisoners up there, and he 
                           <hi id="d47486e4008" style="text-decoration: underline;">expected</hi> to find them when he got back.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e4012">Our boys have had to live in terribly uncomfortable places, in the midst of dirt and
                           filth, in a country famous for its awful winter climate. They have been homesick,
                           disgruntled with their officers sometimes, and generally miserable, and have "taken
                           it out" by blaming the French and running down the "frogs." It does seem strange,
                           doesn't it, that they forget that France has been the battlefield of the war, and
                           that as long as they were living in a country destroyed and devastated by war, it
                           would not be possible to get the comforts and cleanliness that they found waiting
                           for them in Germany. So many compare the two countries, always to the disadvantage
                           of France. Besides, France is an old country, centuries old even before <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4014"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="260" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span>America was known to exist, with old customs, old cities and buildings; houses built
                           hundreds of years ago, when there were none of our modern improvements and comforts,
                           and the people have kept on living in their old homes and are used to it and like
                           it, and we with our new ideas come over and criticise them and wonder why we must
                           be so miserable and uncomfortable, and how they can be so far behind the times.

                        <p id="d47486e4018">I've met such sweet American boys when I've been on night duty, and we've had such
                           nice talks, and they have all been so broad minded in the view they have taken about
                           France, that I'd like to have hugged them. It's the boys who think beyond their own
                           personal comfort and have a sympathy and intelligence in their outlook on life who
                           appreciate what these people have gone through.

                        <p id="d47486e4021">So many of our boys say, "The French lie down and don't fight; they exposed our flank
                           and made us lose a lot of men by not advancing," but it never seems to occur to them
                           that France had been at it for three years, holding back an enemy who had been forty
                           years preparing for this war, that they had been through the suffering, the despair
                           and agony that only those who have had to retreat and have fought in what seemed at
                           times a losing battle know and feel; that they had held their lines for three years
                           waiting for their enemy to get worn out, because neither their strength nor their
                           numbers allowed them to waste their armies in rash attacks, that in those three years
                           of war they had learned discipline and to obey orders, and that after they had taken
                           their objective, they were to stop and wait even if the next point were almost in
                           their hands, because if they didn't

                           and American independence, didn't always stop. That was the cause of some mistakes.
                           Then I've been told by American officers we were to be the attack troops for a while,
                           to give the French a rest, and for that reason our boys thought the French were "lying
                           down."

                           convinced that every American soldier who stands on the top of Fort Douaumont and
                           listens to the little description which the Y.M.C.A. man gives of the four years'
                           fighting about there, and looks at the desolation of that shell-torn country, knows
                           that "The Iron Wall of France," the poilus, deserve, instead of our criticism, our
                           utmost admiration.

                        <p id="d47486e4045">Perhaps you wonder why I've written all this. It's because letters begin to come back
                           here from America intimating that our boys have not been well treated by the French,
                           and that they are saying all sorts of disagreeable things about the poilus. I know
                           all the boys are not doing it, but some do. "No real American would," a boy assured
                           me the other night, "only our army is made up of such a variety that they aren't all
                           true Americans." And another boy told me the same night that he had just received
                           a letter from his mother, saying she guessed the Americans were not very well received
                           over here, and he said, "I just sat down and wrote her that if she heard such things,
                           she could feel sure the company those who said them had been keeping was no good."
                           I always implore the boys who make the slurring remarks <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4047"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="263" data-tei-n="194"> </a></span>not to do it at home, if for no other reason than to spare the feelings of the parents
                           of the boys who won't go home. I don't want them to feel that they have made their
                           sacrifice for a worthless country and worthless people. Our boys have been over here
                           too long since the Armistice with nothing to do to interest them. One grumbles and
                           the next catches it and grumbles a little louder.

                        <p id="d47486e4050">Wilson has become most unpopular with all the nations, especially France, and the
                           affection and admiration which the French gave the Americans at first cooled down
                           for a while because of him. But now they see that all Americans do not hold his ideas,
                           and I think they are blaming him as a man and not America as a whole for the delay
                           in the peace. Some think his League of Nations is good enough in theory but thoroughly
                           impractical, and that much valuable time has been lost discussing it. He does not
                           live here, he does not know the conditions, he does not know the people or their characteristics,
                           and he's trying to lay down the law for them, a law which they see no way of carrying
                           out.

                        <p id="d47486e4053">I can't say, either, that the actions of all American officers and men, and I'm sorry
                           to add, American women also, in Paris, are anything to be proud of. I've never been
                           able to force myself to go back since those two days I spent there when Wilson came.
                           We rose to the war in a magnificent way, we sent our armies and our boys off in a
                           magnificent spirit, and I can't bear to have those who have gone home and do the loud
                           talking and the grumbling and the criticising, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4055"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="264" data-tei-n="195"> </a></span>and those who stay here and do the drinking and sporting about in Paris, ruin it for
                           us in America by slandering France and the French army, and by disgracing Americans
                           in the eyes of the French here in Paris.

                        <p id="d47486e4059">The French—the English also, by the way—naturally resent it when we say or infer that
                           there had been no fighting done in France before America came in, and they resent
                           our assertions that the war was won in sectors of the lines really short compared
                           with the whole length of the battle line. Ours were hard nuts to crack, and we did
                           it and sacrificed our men to do it, and we did very much towards helping to win the
                           war, but if you were French and had lived the life of a French poilu and had earned
                           through part of the war one cent a day, you would not care to hear too much boasting
                           of what others had done who knew nothing of what had happened before they came. Germany
                           and the German army too had been pretty well worn down, so the German prisoners told
                           me, before we began, and when I asked them, men who had fought the Allies on every
                           front, who their worst adversaries were, they said, "The French; they were the good
                           soldiers." The French gave us great credit at the time of the Armistice, they give
                           it to us now, but they 
                           <hi id="d47486e4061" style="text-decoration: underline;">do</hi> know that they had had three years of it before we came in. I can see quite well
                           what the disgruntled French officer meant when he said to an American officer in the
                           train one day, "You've taken all our hotels, you've taken all our seats in the trains,
                           you've taken all our women, and now it's time for you to go home." It might make <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4064"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="265" data-tei-n="196"> </a></span>us mad if we hadn't enough sense of humor to know that every word he said was true.
                           He had been unable to find a room in Paris the night before because of Americans;
                           he had had to stand up hours in the trains because of Americans, and perhaps the rest
                           of the tale was just as sad, but he didn't tell it.

                           the other workers could sleep for a while when they were on, but being all alone I
                           found work enough to keep me busy all the time. Jules, the trusted canteen orderly,
                           was a fine companion and great help. There is always an American mob for breakfast
                           at five o'clock, going to Rheims, and another at six o'clock for Verdun. I had to
                           keep my counter stocked, sell chacuterie, and make chocolate all at the same time,
                           which was difficult, so I did all I could before the rush began. The minute an American
                           train comes in, there is such extraordinary order in the canteen. A line is formed
                           as a matter of course. Most of the poilus catch on and fall in, too; but some sneak
                           up to the ticket window, poilu fashion, and try to get their tickets first. We tell
                           them to "make a tail," and they go obediently to the end of the line and wait their
                           turn. Doughnuts have been added to our chacuterie, much to the delight of the American
                           boys. They are always polite about them and say they are very good, even when they
                           are flavored by mistake with strong peppermint, as they <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4071"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="266" data-tei-n="197"> </a></span>were once when I was on night duty. The poilus like doughnuts, too, but when I have
                           them to sell I always tuck as many as I can under the counter and wait for the American
                           boys to come before I put them out.

                           to hunt for graves, often their brother's. Sometimes they sit alone by the hour in
                           a corner of the canteen, waiting for their trains. If it seems best, I take them a
                           newspaper to read. It's hard to know whether or not to disturb them.

                        <p id="d47486e4077">We have lost a little of our military air and discipline lately, for the refugees
                           are beginning to go back, and we have been ordered to feed them, men and women. They
                           are so happy to be going back to their "pays." When you see the wonderful courage
                           of the little old couples who go through the canteen almost every day on their way
                           "home"—"Home to what?" I ask them, "Oh, nothing, Mlle., there is nothing left, no
                           house, no garden, nothing, but it is the only home we have, and we'll put up a little
                           barraque and start again;" and when a French mother who has lost three sons on the
                           battlefield says to you, "Yes, Mlle., it is hard, but it would have been harder to
                           have had no sons to give to France," then you know what France is really made of.
                           Often the destruction of towns is so complete that it is impossible to tell where
                           their house stood. In one village I saw the other day, the only place to make a garden
                           was on top of four graves, and there it was being made.

                        <p id="d47486e4124">The French General arranged a ceremony for us on Memorial Day at the Military Cemetery.
                           When we arrived in our camion, some of us chattering and laughing as though we were
                           going to a picnic, we found the French soldiers, picked ones, standing round in silence
                           waiting for us, and also many French women dressed in mourning, who had come to pay
                           respect to our dead. As we got out, I suggested as meekly as possible that we be a
                           little less hilarious, but the laughing and talking only seemed to grow louder. Then
                           while we were standing waiting for the General to give the signal to proceed, and
                           the bugles were sounding, there was another lively conversation going on among us.
                           I ventured once more to suggest silence, and a little respect, and the only response
                           I got that time was, "Rats!"
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47486e4127">The graves were beautifully decorated, covered with flowers and plants, a beautiful
                           big bouquet at the foot, and a lovely large silk American flag at the head, all done
                           by the French. After the General had finished his little speech, in which he told
                           us that our dead were their dead, that whereas the French soldier had inscribed on
                           his cross, "Died for France," the American would have on his, "Died for Humanity,"—that
                           the French mother, whenever she sent up a prayer for her sons would never forget the
                           American boys here, etc., the French officers, city officials, and veterans of the
                           War of 1870, bareheaded, formed a little procession and visited each grave separate­

                           to turn our backs and walk away! As far as the French went, the ceremony was a charming
                           recognition of a sacred American day. As far as the Americans went, it was an awkward
                           failure.

                        <p id="d47486e4146">Last night an old woman was brought up to my room. She had come from miles away to
                           see her son, who is in the madhouse here. She had not eaten or slept for I don't know
                           how long. Her son had been in Salonica, had caught the Oriental fever, come back to
                           France, been put in the heavy artillery, couldn't stand the winter climate after the
                           heat, and had caught cold; had gone to the hospital again, and come out with "strange
                           ideas," she said. She had come over to see if she could help him. The doctor t o l
                           d h e r he might get well, and she could "only hope." Before the war she and her husband
                           had three houses near Soissons. The Germans came, everything was destroyed, their
                           little fortune wiped out, and now here they are, destitute. He is seventy-four years
                           old and not able to do much. She looks about the same age. She has a bad heart and
                           had been told by the doctor some time ago she must have "no emotions." "No emotions,"
                           she said, "my life has been nothing but emotions these last years, and now my son
                           is ‘fou.’” She and her husband have hired a "little corner" in a barn which was under
                           a hill near her home and so escaped being entirely destroyed. They have started a
                           little garden, but the weather has been so bad that nothing is growing well for them.
                           Her voice was so sweet and calm, and she was so anxious not to inconvenience us,

                        <p id="d47486e4160">Every Sunday afternoon we put on fresh aprons, coiffes, collars and cuffs, and go
                           to the Jard to listen to the music. The Jard and canals through it form the chief
                           charm of Châlons. The garden was laid out by the same man who planned Versailles.
                           Here the military band or orchestra of the Sixth Army Corps play for an hour and a
                           half Sunday afternoons. All the military, French, English and Americans, in the vicinity
                           come to listen to the music. It is a fascinating scene to watch them walking slowly
                           round and round the stand, up and down the paths shaded by the beautiful old trees,
                           or sitting in picturesque groups on the grass near by. It’s the one time I realize
                           that for a little while I've really been a part of it all.

                        <p id="d47486e4164">Sunday evenings M. Pommeret and a friend of his, officers who are stationed at Matougue
                           near Châlons, generally take Mme. Oblin and me to dinner at the Angleterre, and then
                           to the Arena or theatre afterwards, where we see real French performances. They are
                           pleasant little diversions. One day we were invited to Matougue to their "popote."
                           They sent a camion over for us at 10.30. Their mess is in a little room which is decorated
                           with a frieze of silhouettes of all the officers who had eaten there before them.
                           We went in through the kitchen, where a big fat woman was preparing our delicious
                           luncheon. It was very festive, with the finest of wines to cheer us up. After <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4166"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="273" data-tei-n="201"> </a></span>luncheon we were shown about the town and country, and were urged to remain for dinner,
                           which we did. Getting out of the town was very exciting, for no camions were supposed
                           to leave in the evening, so we had to escape the superior officer and steal a camion
                           unknown to him. I'm sure that he was peeking out at us all the time, though, and afterwards
                           M. Pommeret told us that he joked them about it, but was very nice.

                        <p id="d47486e4169">American nurses are flocking through here now on sightseeing leaves. Most of them
                           are impatient and expect us to leave our work and wait on them the instant they appear
                           in our canteen office, where they have to eat. We have no provision for serving meals
                           there, and there are never plates or bowls or spoons enough when they come on those
                           trains which bring the mob of soldiers, so it is impossible to feed them as soon as
                           they wish, and often they get up and go out in a huff. One said that she was sure
                           not an American boy at the counter would eat a thing if he knew we were not serving
                           her. We always tell them that if they'll wait a few minutes, we'll do our best, but
                           although some are nice and considerate, most of them are not. They expect to spend
                           the night in the office, and the floor, chairs, tables and couch are so crowded with
                           them that we often can't open the doors of the closets to get out our capes. They
                           make it into a dressing room. Some even put on nightgowns and do up their hair in
                           curl papers. Finally Miss Mitchell had to put up a sign saying that they were allowed

                           so we beg a ride and spend the day there, wandering around the trenches and taking
                           pictures. German tanks are still there, with three or four dead Germans near them.
                           I don't know why they have been left there, unless the story is true that when the
                           French started to bury them they found bombs planted underneath, and no one would
                           touch them after that. You can see how they were caught coming out from a shell hole,
                           where they evidently had been hiding.

                           I found that Miss Billings had discovered an American boy, a courier, who goes to
                           Luxemburg every week for a day, and had asked him to take us along. The day we expected
                           to go he had a car full, so Miss Billings and I beat our way up to Vouziers, where
                           we took some pictures of a German field hospital under a hill, and got back in time

                           Billings to go down and interview the driver. She came back radiant, said that he
                           had a free day, and would take us wherever we wanted to go. I grabbed my camera and
                           we were off in a jiffy up to our front, to explore Somme Py and the country about.
                           Getting "essence" was quite a worry, but we found a man who let us have some, so we
                           were able to go to Rheims along the German lines, a most interesting trip. The first
                           and only inhabitants of Somme Py, the butcher and his wife, gave us wine and were
                           very generous in offering us food, which I hated to take as their "ravitaillment"

                           canteen. Two or three days after, a few of us went up to his funeral in the diminutive
                           chapel of the Hôpital Militaire. We took up a big wreath from the "Dames de la Croix
                           Rouge Americaine." It was the smallest possible gathering. Three or four women dressed

                           was a French stronghold on the Belgian border. We had to cross through a corner of

                           off the train here, much to their disgust. Our artillery regiment goes out tomorrow,
                           beginning at six in the morning, and from then on, detachments move every two hours.
                           Our infantry regiment is at Colmar already, all but the Châlons company, which is
                           the last to move. They will be here a few days longer. After that we shall be soldierless.
                           At any rate, the canteen closes on Monday—that is, for the American Red Cross. I don't

                           general unrest and dissatisfaction with all governments. In the canteen, too, the
                           indecision is trying. No one knows what she is going to do, or what she wants to do.
                           The fascination of this life is hard to give up. Even dirty old Châlons is hard to
                           leave, and I don't know what I'll do when I don't live over a railroad station.

                           had been an accident. I always travel those days, it seems to me. The flowers in the
                           fields are wonderful. The red masses of poppies are so bright that they almost hurt
                           your eyes. Instead of war implements on the trains now, you see farming imple­<span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4623"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="303" data-tei-n="211"> </a></span>ments. There are suspension bridges swung across the Marne, where the old ones have
                           been blown up. The shell holes are covered with grass and hay, and the outskirts of
                           the war country seem to be inhabitable and inhabited again. We are getting down towards
                           Chateau Thierry, the Mecca for Americans. It's funny how irritated I get when I hear
                           the remarks of American civilian travellers. It will certainly be bedlam over here
                           when they really begin to come. You ought to have come when I sent for you. I could
                           have arranged to have you and the car come over then if you had only said the word.
                           You'll never have the ghost of an idea now what it has been like.

                           to announce that peace had been signed, we were sitting at a little café on the Champs
                           Elysées drinking beer. There seemed to be no excitement whatever.

                           poilus form circles and dance around couples, of any age or description, calling out
                           "Embrassez,—embrassez-vous, embrassez-vous," and the victims were not allowed to escape

                           to forget their official dignity. One had climbed up an electric light pole in the
                           middle of the boulevard, and was about to direct the singing of the crowd. He asked
                           them to have a little patience, and said that first his friends would give them a
                           short concert of American songs, after which he would ask them to all join in singing
                           the Marseillaise. They sang two or three popular American songs, to a charmed audience,
                           and then the leader took an English flag from some one in the crowd and with it led
                           the Marseillaise. Everyone sang, and my escort in a most pleased voice remarked, "Pas
                           mal, pas mal." It was really very well done,

                           a splendid view of the whole affair. The French brought out their old battle flags.
                           All the buildings, the Place and the statues, were beautifully decorated for us, done
                           in such exquisite taste, and it was a holiday for all. The Americans march in the
                           solid wall formation, which looks as though nothing could break it. They were all
                           about the same size men, and with their steel helmets they presented a very formidable
                           front. The French march in looser formation, and are more relaxed, which is not as
                           striking in parades. An American boy standing beside me seemed quite outraged that
                           the French had brought out such careless looking soldiers, so I tried to explain that
                           it was their way of marching, and that the French Army had found they could march
                           longer distances a day by doing it that way.

                        <p id="d47486e4759">Started from Amiens on a three-days trip in automobile driven by an English officer.
                           Took our luncheon along. Had some difficulty in deciding where to go, as only the
                           main highways were open. The other roads had not been repaired and the officer did
                           not care to risk taking his new car on bad roads. Went through Albert, stopped and
                           took pictures of the church. The Germans had taken away the Virgin which had hung
                           out at right angles from the tower all through the war. Albert much destroyed. Went
                           through Bapaume to Arras, where we were in luck, as the Cathedral door was open, so
                           we could go in and I got a few pictures. Then drove through the city to Hotel de Ville,
                           which was a wreck. Next stopped at Vimy Ridge. F. King and I explored the tunnels
                           the Canadians made to go under the Ridge and place their mines. They were pitchy black
                           and wet, and seemed to go on for miles. Then we climbed to the top of the Ridge and
                           saw the line of huge craters, seven or eight, made when the Canadians blew up the
                           German trenches, and incidentally blew off the top of the Ridge. I asked two poilus
                           to go down into one of the craters, so to get some of the idea of its size in a picture.
                           They were setting off unexploded ammunition near by, and as we went away, there was
                           a frightful explosion, and some pieces of shell whizzed over our heads, disconcertingly
                           near. An officer who had fought at Vimy was on top of the Ridge when we were, so we
                           listened to his

                           Went through Souchez to Lens, the worst mess I've seen anywhere. Nothing but a mass
                           of débris of bricks and twisted iron. Not one thing standing. Got to Lille the middle
                           of the P.M., engaged rooms and looked about the town. Could press a button while in
                           bed and unlock the door of our rooms. The Germans must have enjoyed that luxury very
                           much. Dined with our captain chauffeur and went to bed early. The Germans have taken
                           away all the brass.

                           an English military bridge, through Menin, to Pilcom Ridge, where we got out and explored
                           the trenches. It is right over Ypres, and the Germans were entrenched there all the
                           time. Took pictures of English tanks which had succeeded in getting up as far as this
                           on the Ridge, and of the "Cemetery of Tanks" below the Ridge. There must have been
                           over a dozen stuck down there in the Flanders mud, total wrecks.

                           in the mud and drowned there. Saw Mt. Kemmel, crossed Messines Ridge, through Poperinghe,
                           through Armentiéres, back to Lille. A good many of the trenches have already been
                           filled in and much of the barbed wire cleared away. Much more cleared up than the
                           French fronts. Felt in more or less of a hurry, as Mrs. King and K. wanted to catch
                           the train for Paris at five o'clock. Frances and I dined again with our English captain,
                           and the next day, in a drizzling rain, started off towards St. Quentin via Douai,
                           Cambrai and Bourlon Wood. We got out there, but the place was so wet that we didn't
                           explore it much. There had been very heavy fighting in those woods. Old guns and cannon
                           about just as they were left. German camouflaged helmets lying around in the ruins.
                           It was very interesting in spite of the day. Went on to Le Catelet and Bellicourt,
                           where the canal goes underground for such a long distance. Thousands of Germans lived
                           in that tunnel. Americans didn't know it was there, so went beyond it on top of the

                           via Peronne, where we spent the night at the hotel. Were much amused watching a party
                           of American naval officers and women. In the evening we watched the dancing, and the
                           gray haired dignified English officers entertaining French madamoiselles. They say
                           that during the war Amiens was a "den of iniquity."

                           were waiting, and I tossed them all the Camel cigarettes I had, much to their joy.

                           go over to the Elysée Palace Hotel (A.E.F. headquarters), and see what we could do
                           there. Miss King only asked for one, for her mother, but after refusing definitely,
                           the officer gave us four passes, so we were well fixed.

                           and took me out. We tried to see the procession round the Cenotaph, but I got tired
                           of balancing myself between a German cannon and a tree, so we didn't stay long enough.
                           Walked from the Place Bastille up town, to see the decorations. Hotel de Ville was
                           lovely. Paris a dream.

                        <p id="d47486e4916">When we walked home that evening the Champs Elysées was already crowded behind the
                           ropes. People on camp stools, folding chairs, etc. Babies in hammocks swung from one
                           chair to another, ready for the night. All the trees were full of people. Men with
                           ladders went from one tree to another. When one was full, all connection with the
                           ground was broken, and they were there for the night and until after the parade the
                           next day. Saw

                           breakfasts. Rue Balzac being on a hill, was already packed full of standing people.
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d47486e4924"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="331" data-tei-n="219"> </a></span>Could scarcely get through. The side streets were crowded with all kinds of carts,
                           from Paris and country about, filled with ladders, clothes horses and boards, ready
                           to be put up after midnight against anything that could be found to support them.
                           Such a noise as went on all night under my window, music, automobile horns, people
                           laughing and talking. Got up at five A.M. and at six we started out. It was almost
                           impossible to get through rue Balzac. We pushed and elbowed and finally accomplished
                           it. One cross street several blocks down was supposed to be kept open, so we went
                           there and found it absolutely blocked. However, we got into the crowd, and pushed
                           along towards the Champs Elysées. It was a near panic getting across, and I thought
                           we'd be caught there and not be able to see a thing. The mounted police were ordered
                           to charge on us, and if it hadn't been for a high-up Paris official who was trying
                           to cross in the same place, we never should have made it. I thought Mrs. King would
                           be crushed to death. It was almost as bad getting to the sidewalk after we had crossed
                           the avenue. When we reached the Elysée Palace, the doors were not open, and we had
                           to wait outside there half an hour. Finally got settled in a window on the ground
                           floor, but after the parade started, I went up on the roof, to be able to see the
                           armies pass under the Arch. Had a magnificent view, although to get it I had to make
                           a perilous trip up the roof on an outside ladder. Felt thoroughly satisfied with my
                           position, heard the music play as they came under the Arch, and saw them march through.

                           Saw the dancing on the streets, and the fireworks over the river. The sight from the
                           Tuileries garden was one that never will be seen again, I imagine. Wonderful clouds
                           in the sky, lighted up by searchlights from all directions. The Eiffel Tower lighted,
                           the Arc-de-Triomphe lighted with flaming lamps burning all the way across the top.
                           The gardens were illuminated and decorated with lanterns, as were the Place de la
                           Concorde and Champs Elysées. Magnificent fireworks bursting all over the sky, just
                           like fairyland. It was impossible to believe it was real.

                        <p id="d47486e4969">A day or so after, Miss Billings and I went up to Soissons. Found an automobile with
                           a woman chauffeur to take us to the Chemin des Dames. Walked towards Pinon through
                           unsalvaged German trenches, went into concrete dugouts, some great round galleries
                           filled with tons of absorbent cotton and bandages. Others were piled so full of ammunition
                           that we couldn't get in. Trench mortars, machine guns, etc., lying about outside.
                           As the Chemin des Dames is impassable for automobiles, we had to walk over to Fort
                           de la Malmaison. It was a long hot walk and we found a very much destroyed fort at
                           the end of it.

                        <p id="d47486e5015">The prisoners had collected every kind of a thing to make partitions for themselves,
                           and many of them had made private cells, which were exceedingly neat. It was damp
                           and dark inside, with only a few little stoves, an awful place to live. The prisoners
                           help with the administration of the camp. We talked to some of the clerks in the office,
                           who seemed cheerful enough. Our French guard let us go wherever we wished, so we watched
                           the metal workers in their little workshop, and inspected the kitchen. On our way
                           out we passed a German officer walking along swinging his cane, looking very haughty
                           and defiant, as they always do.

                        <p id="d47486e5018">Coucy-le-Château was our next stopping place. Near the station found a big German
                           naval gun emplacement, one of the biggest they had. The one which fired on Paris was
                           in the Bois-de-Coucy, they told us, the other side of the town. We didn't have time
                           to go there.

                        <p id="d47486e5022">On our way to St. Quentin we passed the Hindenburg line. Went to see Amy Steinner
                           in her little foyer de Soldat there. She appeared very anxious to get rid of me, although
                           we stayed only about fifteen minutes.

                           excursion to Anizy and Mont-des-Singes, attached myself to some American boys who
                           seemed to know what they were about, and they engineered me around through the German
                           trenches on one side of the hill, and the French on the other. All the time we were

                        <p id="d47486e5035">The top of the hill reminded me of Verdun. Nothing but a mass of deep shell holes
                           in the white clay, skeletons in some, feet sticking out of others; all covered with
                           poppies so red that they almost blinded you. On our way down, found a dugout in which
                           were ten or twelve Germans who had been gassed. It was awfully deep and hard to get
                           in. I wasn't sure that I could stand it. It was a puzzle to grope your way along without
                           stepping on those lying in the passage. In the room at the end, some were sitting
                           in chairs, others leaning over the table, still others on the wire beds, or stretched
                           out on the floor,—just as they were when the gas caught them. It seemed only musty
                           down there, not really disagreeable at all. They had been playing cards, and the game
                           was spread out on the table, together with their letters and books. Their hands were
                           mummified, but you could almost see the muscles in their broad shoulders. Probably
                           the gas, and being so far down away from the air, had preserved them. Don't know how
                           I ever could have gone into such a place. The only reason must be because they were
                           our enemies, and you don't feel the same about them as you do about anything else
                           in the world.

                           she had gone to Laon and wanted me to go up for Sunday, so the next Saturday went
                           up there. Saw the work of the Committee for Devastated France. Had dinner with Elsa

                           Miss Thomas (Bryn Mawr) and Helen Taft. The girls from Laon had taken us as far as
                           that, so when we were ready to go on, we sat by the roadside and waited for transportation
                           of some kind. Spent night at Rheims, went to Y.M.C.A. and watched a dance, and to

                           des Dames. Nothing whatever left of Craonne. In the afternoon went down to Pinon,
                           where we explored the great underground galleries there. Saw an American boy who had
                           monkeyed with ammunition rushed by in an automobile with face streaming with blood.
                           He had thrown a fuse down, which went off, injuring him and the girls and men near
                           him. Talked to the cousin of the woman who had cooked for the Kaiser when he had lived
                           at Pinon in a château there owned by a French countess. She was evidently a friend
                           of his, because the woman said that the chateau had never been hit while the Germans
                           were attacking Pinon or taking Soissons, and when they left, all the furniture was
                           taken away and returned later unhurt. The owner had come back to her ruins after the
                           French had retaken the place, but was none too popular in the neighborhood. Whenever
                           the Emperor went out to drive while there, the inhabitants left the streets, as they
                           did not care to salute him. Some families had come back, and were living in dugouts.
                           A few had new barraques. They were all very cordial and glad to see us.

                           and relied on our Red Cross uniforms to take us along and give us military rates.
                           Went to Bruges for the first night. Next morning looked around, saw the Memlings,
                           took boat around the canals, and in the afternoon went down to Blankenburg for that
                           night. Next day went to Seebrugge, saw the Bruges Canal stopped up. Belgian soldiers
                           were taking down the concrete fortifications at the mouth of the canal. The Germans
                           had burned the piers before they left. Then walked over to the Môle, passed Boches
                           prisoners who were gathering up the barbed wire on the beach. Whole coast covered
                           with it. Walked out on the Môle. Took the wrong way and had to climb up on the railing,
                           but with the help of some sailors, made a safe crossing. Saw hole English boat hook
                           had made in the fence when they tried to climb up on the Môle. Also the great hole
                           made in the Môle itself by the English submarine when they exploded it and ten thousand
                           pounds of dynamite. Captain Fryatt's boat "The Brussels" was still there, but the
                           next day they were expecting to salvage it.

                           on the way. Got some of the camouflaged guns used for coast defence. Then went to
                           Ostend in the afternoon and found rooms at a hotel on the beach; rather reasonable.
                           In the evening walked along the breakwater, which is still covered with barbed wire,
                           and made arrangements to take a trip the next day over the Belgian front.

                           hogs). Went to Nieuport, where the Belgians blew up the dykes to flood the Germans
                           out. Crossed the Yser, and took pictures of the German trenches on the one side and
                           the Belgian on the other. Then to Dixmude, Ypres, out towards Mt. Kemmel, Poelcappelle,
                           Forêt d'Houthulst, and Moëre, where the big gun is which was used to fire on Dunkirk
                           when the Germans thought the English needed discipline.
