                        <p id="d6976e190">Ship pictures of the nineteenth century, largely from the collection of the late Laurence
                           John Brengle, are on exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art until 
                           <date id="d6976e192" when="--01-16">January 16</date>. This seldom seen phase of art has been selected in accordance with the Museum’s
                           policy of varying its exhibits to interest the greatest number.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e196">The Museum’s exhibition tells the story of the shipping of the later, part of the
                           eighteenth century, the age of the clipper and packets of the mid nineteenth century
                           and the early age of steam. According to Henri Marceau, Curator of Paintings at the
                           Museum “Its material illustrates the work of artists whose sincere approach to their
                           subject frequently overcame lack of great formal training and permitted them to rise
                           to unexpected heights. At their very best . . . these painters must rank with the
                           most distinguished of marine painters.”

                        <p id="d6976e214">Outstanding among the pictures are the water colors by members of the Roux family
                           of Marseilles, Anton Roux 1765–1836, and his three sons, Antoine, Frederic, and Francois.
                           All members of the family except Frederic worked in their native city, representing
                           the life of its ancient and active harbor. Their shop was the favorite resort of sea-captains
                           from the world over, who came to buy paintings of their ships made while these were
                           riding at anchor nearby. Homeward bound, many a Yankee shipper has carried the portrait
                           of his ship for his employer or for himself. The Brengle collection contains sixteen
                           examples by members of the Roux family as well as examples by some of their numerous
                           European imitators, water colors by Honore Pellegrin, Domenico Gavarrone, W. Bygrave,
                           and Edmund Camellati.

                           E. Buttersworth, and other nineteenth century painters whose names are unknown. Of
                           especial interest in this latter group are a number of works painted in the harbor
                           of Hong Kong by Chinese artists. These were doubtless made in imitation of European
                           or American originals which probably explains their strange mixture of oriental and
                           occidental painting traditions. Pictures of this kind were brought to America in large
                           quantities by ships engaged in the China Trade, and are familiar heirlooms in many
                           a Philadelphia family.

                        <p id="d6976e295">After the laborious and sometimes dull process of growing up, there is, now and again,
                           an idea that forces itself upon us in none too comfortable a fashion. It’s an idea
                           drenched in practicability—and maybe it has also occurred to you.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e298">An artist must live.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e302">This, incidentally, is not quite so platitudinous as it sounds. For there are many
                           idealists among us who think artists are a thing apart—that they are not bound by
                           the stupid material conditions of life—that if they desire to go visiting in another
                           part of town they simply float there rather than resort to the pedestrian methods
                           of the flesh—and that so mundane a thing as eating is unknown no less than unnecessary
                           to them. In a word, the idealistic conception of an artist is that he should be, not
                           a man, but an element of unquestionable divinity whose legacy of beauty is received
                           free of charge and droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e305">If this were true, we’d find it considerably less enchanting than our idealistic friends.
                           Without the soil there is no bloom, thank goodness, so our little idea once more thumbs
                           its nose at the world in general. An artist must live.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e308">Strangely enough, the ages in art history that produced works of the greatest “elegance”
                           likewise nurtured a substantial belief in our little idea. However, in our own day
                           there unfortunately exists an almost total lack of general interest in the material
                           well-being of our artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e311">Seemingly, the sole reason for this is, not a natural lack of susceptibility to art
                           on the part of the public, but a pathetic state of mental and emotional inertia. We
                           have demonstrated, as a nation, our magnificent gifts of achievement in industry and
                           science, but remain practically halfwitted in our response to art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e314">It is unnecessary to say that the layman’s artistic backwardness is due largely to
                           his lack of exposure to art’s seductive influence. He needs to live with it awhile
                           before he takes it to his heart.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e317">And this he’ll never do until he buys it. Furthermore, if he doesn’t begin soon we
                           shed a tear for the future of art in America, because, as you’ve heard before, an
                           artist must live.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e321">This jolly holiday season is probably a very fat one for the stores that dispense
                           tawdry chromos. In all likelihood half the purchasers cherish genuine affection for
                           these horrible things—as do those to whom they are presented. Art might stand a fighting
                           chance with the other half, if it had the opportunity—and the popularity of art, in
                           that case, might spread.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e324">Any reasonable sum of money—for from six to seventy dollars, let us say—will buy an
                           original work of art by an American artist. Cheap chromos cost as much, and constitute
                           complete financial waste.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e327">So, Mr. America, if you’re going to give her a picture, make it an original!</p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e330">We find the 44th Annual Exhibit of the Oil Paintings at the Art Club an extremely
                           active and colorful show, with many good painters represented. The show is even in
                           character—consequently no particular painting steals it. There are, however, a few
                           that stand mildly above their fellows.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e333">Grace Gemberling, for example, has created a most distinctive phantasy of tree roots,
                           and Yarnall Abbott an equally striking phantasy of houses, not only decorative but
                           rather dramatic. Carl Lindborg has gotten well away from his erstwhile formality in
                           “The Player”—perhaps a bit too obviously posed, but convincing in its analysis of
                           the character of the model.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e336">Sue May Gill, in “Clouds over Bonaventure Island” has achieved the essence of simplicity
                           in the use of broad brush strokes. From Biagio Pinto comes a tremendously stimulating
                           study of “Flowers,” full of swirls that were dear to the heart of Soutine, but, in
                           a sensuous way, very much the property of Biagio. Frederick Nunn comments amply and
                           lustily upon “Tuesday After Labor Day,” Florence Standish Whiting’s “Sudden Storm”
                           is a dream in paint, with pattern but depth, and Carroll Tyson’s spots and lines of
                           color constitute a rich pigmental fabric.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e340">Charles W. Ward’s “The Bowery” offers an interesting example of combination of the
                           vision of painter and social message. The former is superior to the latter. Hari Kidd
                           embraces an “Embrace” with his characteristically sensuous splotches of vivid color,
                           and Antonio Martino reveals “Marie,” a quaint child quaintly handled.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e343">Julius Bloch’s “Tom, the Bootblack,” a young negro, is the best realistic study in
                           the show. Walter Stuempfig looks at “Laurel Hill” and creates a pleasantly Venetian
                           composition and color design ill at ease with its subject. Cheery, too, is Walter
                           Gardner’s “Figure Composition.” Arthur B. Carles’ “Flowers” are not flamboyant as
                           usual—subtle, repressed, harmonious. “Turf at Chalma” comes from S. Walter Norris
                           with his usual technique of color lozenges within static areas, and iridescence reminiscent
                           of ancient pottery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e346">Never sweet is the brown, green and pink of Franklin Watkins’ seascape, but always
                           expressive. Expressive also, but in a vastly different way, is Emlen Etting’s “Moonlight,”
                           revealing great directness of plastic vision and the ability to compose strikingly.
                           This canvas, incidentally, is reproduced as a supplement of this issue of the Philadelphia
                           Art News.

                        <p id="d6976e349">Morris Blackburn contributes one of his most remarkable recent paintings. It suggests
                           but does not embody Leger—it has succeeded in extracting the essence without slavery
                           to substitute—and creates compact volume, with color extremely vital and stimulating.
                           As one may suspect by now, we liked this canvas.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d6976e355">We have rarely seen the work of a neater technician than Ralston Crawford, who is
                           showing currently at the Boyer Galleries. Cleanliness of line and mass interpreting
                           the industrial scene seems the sole concern of this artist, and he has turned it to
                           remarkable graphic account.

                        <p id="d6976e359">It is unusual that a present-day painter has been able to pre-conceive his work so
                           thoroughly—in several canvasses the pre-conception is rather too patent. Nevertheless,
                           they are clever, and all manifest harmoniously grayed color.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e362">“Coal Elevators” and “Whitewashed Barn” are both inordinately static—the latter almost
                           killed by inertia. On the other hand, “Barn with Red Gable, No. 2” is an extremely
                           fine composition of grays, black and greens. The static quality of this work is relieved
                           by an occasional touch of tonal informality.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e365">“Water Tank” is thoroughly exciting and out-Demuths the oils of Demuth, producing
                           something that stimulates without the remotest suggestion of visual vitality.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e368">We are at a loss to know why this artist hasn’t done more painting like “Small Hill.”
                           Here we find more breadth of vision and gusto than in all the other canvasses. Yellow-brown
                           mountains and light blue sky fairly palpitate.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d6976e382">That much used phrase, “social consciousness,” which appears to be cropping up more
                           and more frequently in exhibits, in this instance claims first place in the showing
                           of paintings and drawings by Joe Hirsch, now at the Philadelphia A. C. A. Gallery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e386">This quality in the painter seems to have developed hand in hand with his technique.
                           The technique reveals much growth, but we wonder whether we can say as much about
                           an occasionally enslaving insistency to load pictures with ideas quite foreign to
                           pure painting. Propaganda pictures are always death-dealing in subject, and more than
                           frequently death-dealing to the pictures themselves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e389">“Speaker:” the best character painting we have seen for a long while. “Servant of
                           God:” much better than it looks—full of design and simplicity of color. “Two men:”
                           also too Watkins. “Tempest:” the stock market can’t possibly be as important as this.
                           “Landscape with Tear Gas:” would be a good landscape without tear gas.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e392">“View of Toledo:” view of war is more correct. “Street Scene:” not worth the effort.
                           “Idiot:” certainly sufficiently idiotic in subject matter, with fine concentration
                           of color against black, and grand draughtsmanship. “Gabriel:” superb piece of painting,
                           suggests an impressive future for Hirsch. “Rijksmuseum:” almost impressionistic. “Lunch
                           Hour:” so what. “Hercules:” what might commonly be known as “good” painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e395">If one likes forceful lithographs, Louis Lozowick’s prints at the Carlen Galleries
                           are worth a look. While confining his graphic activities to the stone, there is much
                           variety of technical interest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e398">Subjects range from the purely pictorial—landscapes, studies of canyons, and still
                           life—to the industrial scene and portraiture. The industrial prints are most numerous,
                           clean in conception and execution and highly imaginative in handling.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e401">In the scenic realm we find a “Willow Tree” suggestive of the graphic language of
                           a bygone day despite its modernity of treatment. “Grand Canyon” is a dark, well composed
                           print, and in effect reminiscent of molten lava. “Granite Quarry” is a bit confusing
                           with its multiplicity of inconsequential detail, and “Spanning the Hudson” decidedly
                           Japanesque.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e405">“In the Park” is notable for its rather original textural conception and sense of
                           design, “Goat Ripping” is the only dramatic print, and “Still Life with Apples” the
                           one distinctive composition of this sort, accomplished with accuracy that has not
                           killed vitality.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e408">Georgine Shillard, Ann Heebner McDonald, Angeline Christaldi and Marion Jane Turner
                           have created a good show at the Plastic Club.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e411">Angeline Christaldi has obviously, in portraiture, been turning an eye in the direction
                           of the Russian Boris Gregorieff, as witness “New England Spinster.” “Stormy New England
                           Sunday” has probably a little more in common with the artist herself. Contrast, and
                           a happy one, is furnished by such canvases as “Farm, Chester County” and “Willow Tree,”
                           which we consider the most individual expression in the show.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e414">Ann Heebner McDonald offers a series of low-keyed canvases, and rarely have we encountered
                           such subtle, but effective evasion of detail. Marion Jane Turner shows good academic
                           painting, but little more. Here we should like to find more vigor and emotional penetration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e417">As a pure painter, Georgine Shillard has the lead. This artist has a pigmental vision
                           unhampered by superficial pictorial considerations. Furthermore, we find plastic breadth,
                           a feeling for subdued tonal texture, and happy compositional faculty.

                           period was reduced to an estimated 400,000 a year increase in the first half of the

                           of urban growth, it is still significant because it exceeds the rate of growth of
                           the population as a whole and contrasts with the relative stabilization of rural America.
                           . . . The United States is approaching a roughly stable rural-urban equilibrium, which
                           has already been reached by the major European industrial countries.”

                           much pleasure to his leisure. The automobile permits him to cover much ground in little

                           Due to our industrial scheme the average man works less and has more time for play.

                        <p id="d6976e778">There’s quite a story behind the home and office under construction for Dr. Romeo
                           Luonglo at 2054 Locust Street. It seems that the Doctor started to renovate an old
                           house, had plans drawn by architect Pupano. Things progressed, ideas were conceived
                           and discarded, the Luonglos visited Cleveland and, presto, a house of brick and glass
                           were born. It has a nicely balanced modern interior. Indirect lighting, glass brick
                           walls and fireplaces, modern mechanical kitchen and laundry, air conditioning, and
                           the most modern methods in plumbing, have all combined to make a practical and beautiful
                           home.

                        <p id="d6976e790">Paintings by Margaret M. Lukens of 501 Fayette St., Conshohocken, Pa., received high
                           praise from critics who saw her exhibition at the Studio Guild, 730 Fifth Avenue,
                           New York. Among other commentators impressed with her work is Melville Upton of the
                           New York Sun, who wrote that the pictures were “soundly painted and marked by pleasing
                           color and untroubled banking. ‘August Afternoon’ and ‘Port Antonio’ and ‘Near Mandeville’
                           of her Jamaica series seem especially pleasing.” The exhibition comprised twenty-two
                           paintings, most of them landscapes of New England and Jamaica.

                           in Jugoslavia. This trip is largely the result of the unusual encouragement given
                           her by critics who have been impressed with her facility in portraying on canvas places
                           she has visited, as demonstrated in the canvases on exhibition at the Studio Guild.

                           Salvatore did the sets for “Let the Righteous Be Glad,” a dance based upon a Negro
                           spiritual, and for the very popular “Barn Dance,” while Angelo designed the settings

                        <p id="d6976e827">“In the sales rooms of the auction galleries are reflected the changes of artistic
                           tastes,” says Edmund B. Brickley, for some twenty-five years auctioneer with Samuel
                           T. Freeman and Co. And as an illustration of his point he reflected on the lack of
                           interest in paintings of the American School, embracing such artists as Murphy, Wyant,
                           Lawson, Chase, Crane, Metcalf, and others.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e830">Prior to, and during the World War, European art was at its ebb. Pictures of the American
                           School were in great demand. However, once the dealers had resumed the importation
                           of foreign paintings, American art lost its general appeal. The taste in art now,
                           broadly speaking, is for moderns, particularly the French School, as seen in the recent
                           purchase of Cézanne’s “Bathers” for the Wilstach Collection. Of course the fine examples
                           of the eighteenth century English School will always be in demand.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e833">Reminiscing over past sales, Mr. Brickley recalled one of the most valuable collections
                           ever offered at auction in Philadelphia, the George C. Thomas Collection which realized
                           approximately one hundred and ten thousand dollars. The outstanding picture in this
                           collection was Millet’s “Labourer’s Return” which brought twenty-five thousand dollars.
                           In this same collection appeared the William Penn Charter for the Province of Pennsylvania
                           which realized twenty-two thousand, five hundred dollars, and is now in the Library
                           of Pennsylvania at Harrisburg.

                        <p id="d6976e836">Mr. Brickley also referred to the time of twenty-five years ago when Early American
                           furniture was of little value, and claw and ball chairs, pie crust tables, and other
                           rare pieces could be obtained for about one tenth of the prices today.

                           is again reaffirmed by the recently opened installation of the galleries. Here quality
                           alone has been the main consideration in the selection of some three hundred pictures
                           from the entire collection of close to thirteen hundred.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e964">For the past several years, since the Collection has been housed at the Philadelphia
                           Museum, the public of the City has had an opportunity of viewing exhibitions comprising
                           complete schools. Thus the Italian painting, the Early Flemish and Dutch, the later
                           Flemish and Dutch painting and the French School have been shown in rotation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e967">For the first time since the Collection has belonged to the City, the finest works
                           of all schools have been selected and hung to illustrate with important examples the
                           development of painting from the fourteenth century to the close of the last century.
                           Because its value lies chiefly in its completeness, the Collection as now shown presents
                           an orderly display which carries one from the religiously inspired productions of
                           the early Renaissance epochs in Italy and north of the Alps, in Flanders, Holland,
                           France, Germany and Spain through to Impressionist painting of the nineteenth century
                           in France As an asset to students of painting and to scholars in the history of art,
                           the Johnson Collection’s present exhibition assumes first rank.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e970">Most of the masterpieces which have been on temporary display in the galleries and
                           period rooms of the Philadelphia Museum have been withdrawn from these locations and
                           have been included in the present exhibition in the galleries of the Johnson Collection.
                           These include, among the Italian masters, the “Way to Calvary” by Giovanni di Paolo
                           and the brilliant panel by Sassetta of the same subject. The great Pietro Lorenzetti,
                           “Madonna and Child” one of the finest by the master in America—has also been included.
                           Florentine masters are represented by the four predella panels by Botticelli representing
                           scenes in the life of Mary Magdalen, the Portrait of Lorenzo Lorenzano, also by Botticelli
                           and three earlier works—the St. Francis by Fra Angelico and the two panels of saints
                           by Masolino da Panicale.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e974">Venetian painting is strongly represented by the Pietà by Carlo Crivelli, the Madonna
                           and Child by Giovanni Bellini and the Portrait of a Man by Antonello da Messina, one
                           of the finest of his works. Additional names represented in the Italian section include
                           those of Francesco Pesellino, Niccolo di Tommaso, Matteo di Giovanni, Bernardo Pintorrichio,
                           Benozzo Gozzoli, Vincenzo Foppa and Cima da Conegliano. The closing chapters of Italian
                           painting, the productions of eighteenth century Venetian artists are adequately illustrated
                           by pictures of Antonic Ganale, Francesco Guardi, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Michele
                           Marieschi.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e977">The list of Flemish primitives is long and distinguished. It is headed by the small
                           “wonder picture” by Jan van Eyck—St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata—a work which has
                           been classed among the greatest masterpieces in American collections.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e980">The wealth of the Johnson Collection in works of these masters is a continuing testimony
                           to the taste and knowledge of Mr. Johnson who was in advance of his time in his appreciation
                           of Northern painting and was thus able to secure paintings which in quality have been
                           the admiration of present day students in this field.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e983">Paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries include the well known Unfaithful
                           Shepherd of Pieter Bruegel, three pictures by El Greco—the Crucifixion, Pietà and
                           the Portrait of a Lady, several sketches by Peter Paul Rubens among which is the sketch
                           for the picture “Philemon and Baucis” now in the Museum of the History of Art in Vienna.
                           This last work hangs near the Crucifixion by El Greco and serves to show how much
                           Rubens was influenced by the great Spanish painter. In the same gallery are hung the
                           Johnson Rembrandts—the Finding of Moses, the Head of Christ and the Crucifixion—the
                           first two unquestionably by the Master—the last attributed to him with reservations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e986">Nineteenth century French painting, fills the last of the file of nine galleries.
                           Here the quality of material and its scope is unusual. The gallery illustrates French
                           painting from Poussin to Monet. The masters represented in addition to Poussin include
                           Chardin, Ingres, Delacroix, Géricault, Courbet, Barye, Corot, Millet, Manet, Sisley
                           and Monet. Among the important works here are the Baptism of Christ by Poussin, Fruit
                           and Flowers by Delacroix and the large and impressive Alabama and Kersarge by Manet.
                           Sculpture by Barye and Rodin completes the installation.

                        <p id="d6976e1022">Is your knowledge of Sweden limited to Garbo and smorgasbord? If so, you’d better
                           take a “C” bus down Broad Street and visit the American Swedish Historical Museum,
                           Nineteenth Street and Pattison Avenue.

                        <p id="d6976e1025">The American Swedish Historical Museum, originally the John Morton Memorial, was founded
                           in 1926 to present in a concrete form Sweden’s “total gifts to the progress of our
                           Nation.” There are sixteen galleries, all of which will be completed in time for the
                           “New Sweden” Tercentenary in 1938, devoted to various phases of Swedish American culture.
                           There is the John Ericsson Room, representing inventions and engineering, the Jenny
                           Lind Room, showing the contributions citizens of Swedish origin have made to American
                           music, etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1029">Although the purpose of the museum is primarily social and historical, the plastic
                           arts and the crafts of Sweden have not been neglected. Sculpture and oils commemorate
                           famous men and women; modern and antique textiles are displayed; various periods in
                           Swedish decoration are illustrated in the conceptions and furnishings of different
                           rooms; representations of metal work include several very unusual pairs of candlesticks
                           as well as a collection of copper and silver coffee-pots, tea-pots, and other vessels.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1032">Doubtless the most interesting phase of the museum is its illustration of modern Swedish
                           decoration, of which a good example is the Technical Room. This room, dedicated to
                           Ewald Dahlskog, the famous builder, is dominated by a huge mosaic mural, on the north
                           wall, composed of over two hundred different varieties of Swedish woods. Also of especial
                           interest in the room is the hand-woven rug. The center of this rug is designed to
                           simulate bricks, while the motifs in the border are derived from tools.

                           exploring, if for no other reason than to feel smug when people begin raving about
                           the Swedish art exhibition which will reach Philadelphia next summer.

                           and one that is rapidly dying out. There are but eight of them left in the United
                           States, and as far as Mr. Burke knows there are no apprentices. Mr. Cross studied
                           with the Venetian glassblowers on the island of Murano in Italy after serving his
                           apprenticeship at the Alton Glass Works, Illinois. Mr. Burke, whose apprenticeship
                           was served in the old Sandwich Glass Works, Massachusetts, has been over 56 years
                           in this work. While we stood there and talked to him Mr. Cross made us a beautiful
                           little bud vase in blue glass, decorated after the manner of the Venetian blowers,
                           so fragile in appearance that we were almost afraid to take it with us.

                           Among the Philadelphians who own paintings by Etting are Sturgis Ingersoll, Baron

                           Wayne mounted on a horse. Both man and beast are apparently solid gold, and life-size
                           too. This brilliant nick-nack is, we trustingly believe, from the private collection
                           of King Midas, and while the golden touch was held in high esteem by that potentate
                           and his immediate and exclusive circle, it leaves something to be desired by outsiders
                           who prefer the dignity of sculptural form to the blinding glitter of a golden pretense.

                           or a fabricator, or a poor mathematician, or has flagrantly extravagant taste in barbers.

                           and learned that Geoff was shorn—eight months ago. The courteous thing would be for
                           people to make a public announcement of such drastic personality changes. Therefore
                           we take this opportunity to state that we, of the Art News, can no longer swear “by
                           the beard of the publisher.” B. W. appeared without his chin-spinach about a month
                           ago. Some of us didn’t notice it for a week.

                        <p id="d6976e1290">And well may he wonder. Few stop to think and fewer still are aware of the romance,
                           hardships, and the adventures both tragic and comic experienced daily by that farflung
                           band of cameramen gathering the pictorial record of world events as they occur, visualized
                           for you with your morning milk or aspirin.

                        <p id="d6976e1293">The first duty of a cameraman is to be THERE. On the spot. He must have the jump on
                           reality and not depend as the scribes can and frequently do on ex post facto accounts
                           or observations. He can’t cover his assignment by telephone as reporters can. He’s
                           got to get the picture, regardless of weather conditions, unsympathetic petty officials,
                           and a thousand and one unexpected difficulties that continually crop up and must be
                           promptly met with and disposed of. Then too, he must always be on guard against being
                           outsmarted by rival photographers who are now and then not overscrupulous with their
                           little tricks designed to bring home an exclusive “beat” for their papers. It has
                           been my experience, however, that most of the boys stick pretty well together and
                           cover their assignments in harmony—and may the best man win.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1296">I remember an amusing bit of camera warfare that raged during the filming of the famous
                           Zev-Papyrus race on the Belmont track. At that period I was covering the Philadelphia
                           area for Acme Newspictures. They had made a deal with Pathe Newsreel and tied up the
                           exclusive rights to photograph that important event. The New York office called me
                           on the telephone and instructed me to come to New York to snap just one picture as
                           the ponies galloped past the third quarter. They placed a still-cameraman at each
                           of the quarter posts and at start and finish to get a complete record of the race
                           for the sports editions. Movie cameras were also planted at each quarter-mile post.
                           Fifty Pinkerton detectives guarded the track, taking up all cameras whose owners could
                           not show the special Pathe-Acme pass.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1299">Just as the race was starting rival newsreel and still-cameramen appeared like magic
                           at the high fence surrounding the track, mounted on trucks equipped with scaffolding,
                           platforms, and long-focused lenses that shot over the fence and covered the track
                           quite comfortably. Our outfits had expected something like that, however, and were
                           ready for them Hastily unlimbering a number of long tubes they lit them and set up
                           a rapid and effective smoke-screen a few yards in front of those predatory cameras.
                           I got my picture all right . . . but so did the boys on the other side of the fence.
                           The wind had suddenly shifted and the smoke drifted back in front of some of our own
                           cameramen, leaving the picture-pirates a clear field. Fortunes of war.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1302">On many assignments preliminary passes must be obtained from police or Burgomeisters.
                           Location must be carefully studied and imagination and resourcefulness brought into
                           play in the selection of the most advantageous positions from which to shoot, together
                           with a definite plan of mobile action, anticipating and catching all important sequences
                           as they occur. During the last days of the Hauptman trial at Flemington, Larry Keighley,
                           Philadelphia Evening Ledger photographer, did what he called his death march each
                           time the jury walked to and from the Court House and the Union Hotel across the street.
                           He kept his camera focused on a juror whose collapse from heart failure was momentarily
                           expected. Fortunately the juror’s heart continued to beat, so Larry missed his “beat.”
                           Had the juror collapsed it would have necessitated a new trial.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1305">A nose for news is as essential for a cameraman as for a reporter. It’s especially
                           important for syndicate photographers. The men who work for only one newspaper are
                           generally safe in shooting everything in sight and letting the editors do the selecting.
                           The syndicate men, however, must do their own editing and know just exactly what pictures
                           tell the story. Newspapers subscribing to syndicated picture services for news outside
                           their own territories allot space for only two or three pictures of any one event,
                           and these must tell the story.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1309">Delivering the product of one’s camera is the next vital factor in the game and must
                           be as carefully planned as getting the shots. The first pictures to reach the home
                           office are the ones that grab the gravy. The speed with which they are printed and
                           broadcast throughout the country by airmail, train, messenger, telephone, and radio
                           is incredible. Therefore the necessity of getting the films into the home office as
                           quickly as rival films, if not quicker, is of paramount importance. On big news stories
                           in France and Belgium the films are put aboard planes, weather permitting, and flown
                           to Cherbourg or LeHavre in time to catch the fast liners before they weigh anchor.
                           In New York harbor they are picked up at Quarantine, developed, printed, and headed
                           for publication before the ship has docked.

                        <p id="d6976e1312">When Mlle. Lenglen and Helen Wills staged their famous battle of the century at Cannes,
                           some fast work was required to get the tennis pictures from the Riviera to New York
                           via Paris. As a matter of fact the famous tennis match almost went unphotographed.
                           A would-be monopolist spent good money to tie up the exclusive picture rights. His
                           plan for doubling his money was to charge each movie and still cameraman a heavy fee
                           for the privilege of making pictures. This ambitious holdup was defeated because the
                           victims banded together and refused to take a single picture. The Carleton Hotel management,
                           on whose courts the match was to be played, and who saw their publicity plans tumbling
                           about their managerial ears, stepped in at this critical juncture and anon everything
                           was hotsy-totsy and the cameras were soon clicking and grinding all over the place.
                           Without one sou of tribute. I had arranged for a room for the day at a hotel and had
                           just enough time after the match to dash to my room and unload and pack my films in
                           my temporary darkroom—the clothes closet. I wrote my captions while enroute in a taxi
                           from the hotel to the station and put pictures and captions in the hands of a messenger
                           aboard the Paris-bound express without a minute to spare. I had already studied time
                           tables and boat-train schedules and knew that it would be nip and tuck getting the
                           package across Paris from the Gare de Lyons to the Gare St. Lazare in time to catch
                           the Olympic boat-train, so I wired my assistant in Paris to meet the train and get
                           an agent de police to ride on the runningboard of the taxi with him to facilitate
                           transit across Paris. Just one traffic jam and the jig would be up. The package made
                           the boat—and the cop made some money.

                              ambling around New York’s populous East Side. A hubbub of voices caught his interest
                              and he draw near a spirited street fight.

                              struck up an acquaintance with the youngster and talked him into a ring career. Under

                              So enthusiastic is Davis that his interest in the squared circle threatens to wean

                              he got to the point where he just couldn’t go on without a portrait of his wife. Ricciardi
                              was finally dragooned into painting at that ungodly hour, and by working feverishly
                              under the prodding of his patron, handed him a finished portrait of his wife at 6:30
                              A.M. The couple proudly bore off their prize to catch the next train to Baltimore.

                              of the Art Director’s Club held a soirée. The speaker of the occasion was Arthur Munn,
                              then A. D. of N. W. Ayer. A great many of his auditors were commercial artists who,
                              in a sense, had an axe to grind. When Munn finished his speech he was accorded generous,
                              nay, fulsome applause. One chap, who shall be nameless here, save for the fact that
                              he’s one of the best artists in town, reached a new high in candor. Having acquired
                              a lovely glow during the evening, he rose to his feet, made a generous circular motion
                              with his arms, and shouted, “Hooray for Art Munn! He buys art work!”

                              for the Telephone News the Bell Telephone Company’s publication. For twelve years
                              “Abe” has been turning out his lively pages for a faithful following among his fellow
                              employees. Considering the fact that his drawing must of necessity deal with the amenities
                              of the phone business, it’s a pleasure to say that Cassel hasn’t turned out a dull
                              page. Cassel is a huge fellow, his physique recalling the days when he worked as a
                              cable man for the company. His flair for cartooning brought about his transfer to
                              his present work in the News Offices. “Abe” has contributed cartoons to the Saturday
                              Evening Post, the Country Gentleman, and the old Life magazine, besides his monthly
                              stint which reaches upwards of 20,000 readers in this state and Delaware.

                        <p id="d6976e1519">Studio Easels, those important and very practical objects so hard to acquire at the
                           start of one’s career, range from $2.00 to $75.00. We believe the one priced at $75.00
                           has running water. There is a very fine, sturdy easel on the market for $5.75 that
                           answers the student’s problem and that can be stacked in a very small space.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1522">Air brushes remain about the same in price, $10.00 to $38.50 at most stores. Air brush
                           work is a field in itself, and unbeatable for rendering and retouching poster displays,
                           etc. We are still using a Flit gun, but we admit that it’s messy and are quite willing
                           to accept a more mechanical method.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1526">Water color and oil outfits are always acceptable and desired. We saw a very complete
                           set of water colors for $8.50 that answers all the questions. While many artists prefer
                           to select their own oil colors our local art supply shops know the artist’s needs
                           and have very representative sets made up from $2.00 to $25.00.

                        <p id="d6976e1541">The last item worries us. Why does an artist need a thermometer? We know if we had
                           one it would just be another excuse for not working. It would always be either too
                           hot or too cold.

                        <p id="d6976e1580">Linseed oil has been the most commonly accepted and generally used painting medium
                           since the beginning of the eighteenth century.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1583">Some technical books of today recommend RAW COLDPRESSED UNBLEACHED LINSEED OIL above
                           all other media. For an example, Dr. Martin Fischer says: I. Paint with one medium
                           only—preferably raw unbleached linseed oil. 2. When necessary cut this oil with pure
                           gum spirits of turpentine (it bites into your previously laid-on paint coat). 3. Use
                           no varnishes or shellac in painting. Varnishes are alcohol soluble so that if your
                           painting is ever cleaned the alcohol employed endangers your picture. 4. Use no driers.
                           5. Use no more oil than necessary, but use enough.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1587">Max Doerner disagrees with Dr. Fischer. Doerner’s analysis of the techniques of the
                           old masters indicate that the greatest luminosity, brilliance and variety have been
                           achieved by underpainting with tempera emulsion and glazing and overpainting with
                           resin oil colors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1590">Doerner has much evidence in favor of his theory in the form of surviving examples
                           of the works of Van Eyck, Rubens, Titian, El Greco, Velasquez, and others. On the
                           whole these have withstood deterioration far better than pure linseed oil painting
                           done at a later date. For instance copies of Durer done in oil have yellowed far more
                           than the much older originals. In glazing and overpainting, these masters used various
                           combinations of Venice turpentine, damar varnish, stand oil, sun-thickened linseed
                           oil, and raw cold pressed linseed oil. One part Venice turpentine, one part damar
                           varnish, one part stand oil or sun-thickened linseed oil makes a medium which permits
                           the glistening sparkle of Rubens or the variety and glowing chiaroscuro of Rembrandt
                           if used over suitable under-painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1593">The most durable painting technique known to us is the pure egg tempera of the early
                           Italians. Blending is difficult in tempera, which is by its nature airy, mat, luminous,
                           but dry and hard in finish.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1596">The old masters proved conclusively the practicability of using a combination of tempera
                           and oil painting—lean under-painting in tempera with solidly heightened light areas—overpainted
                           with resin oil colors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1599">We don’t subscribe to Dr. Fischer’s warning against the use of varnish in painting
                           because it may be damaged by restorers of the future who may use alcohol. That’s a
                           restorer’s problem. Incidentally, restorers should be extremely sparing in the use
                           of so strong a solvent as alcohol on any painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1602">It isn’t particularly interesting that we can duplicate the effects achieved by the
                           old masters. It is notable that with our tremendous development of variety in styles
                           through impressionism, cubism, expressionism, surrealism, etc., we have NOT used a
                           comparable variety in techniques. Many new effects have become esthetically acceptable
                           to us, but we have not approached the realization of their full power because we have
                           drowned them in linseed oil or confounded them with careless craftsmanship. This indeed
                           is one of the greatest indictments against many innovators in art—the fact that the
                           painters themselves do not consider their work important enough to demand the fullest
                           technical development—the richest and most complete pigmental vocabulary.

                              program. A great deal has been done in the lower schools but as usual the secondary
                              field is almost barren of purposeful activity.

                           <p id="d6976e1633">Integration is not allowing the Latin pupils the supreme pleasure of making nonsensical
                              notebooks in Art class. It’s the Latin and the Fine Arts departments merging for as
                              long a time as is necessary for the furtherance of a specific group activity. It stands
                              to reason, though it’s hard enough to get teachers and administrators to admit that
                              there are certain fundamental things that should throw the various departments of
                              any secondary school together from time to time.

                           <p id="d6976e1636">Student interest—that sadly neglected quality—is the main thing. The soundest curricula
                              can be built upon that interest and desire. As I have said in previous articles, that
                              interest once aroused can be directed by skillful motivation and teaching to any one
                              of countless ends. That interest is usually individual and when you’ve a group of
                              diverse interests to cope with you’ve a job on your hands. Other times it is wholly
                              within a whole group, but there is always this to look forward to—you’re not the only
                              teacher in charge. You’re one of a group who have pooled their interests so that some
                              kid may be able for once in his life to get a real piece of work done.

                           <p id="d6976e1639">Here is an illustration where the Latin, Geology, Shop, Library, and Art departments
                              all worked together, motivated by one pupil’s interest in a Roman ring:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d6976e1643">A year or so ago, the Latin teacher sent over to my room and asked to borrow a copy
                              of an old Roman ring I sometimes wear. He’d been in the habit of doing that for some
                              time in the past, but this day one of the girls in his class brought the ring back
                              to me, and asked where she could get one like it. Not knowing, I suggested she try
                              to make one. She said she thought that was an idea, and I forgot about it, but a couple
                              of days afterwards the Geology teacher the girl’s home room teacher, dropped in and
                              reopened the incident. I called over the Latin teacher and together we worked out
                              a unit in Roman Jewelry. I showed some slides and drew some pictures. They read about
                              Romar jewelry in their translations and studied the stones the Romans used in Geology
                              class. The upshot was that soon the shop was collaborating with us, with the help
                              of the library and a couple of interested friends, in the construction of a lapidary
                              wheel. Our interests in jewelry that, for the moment, were very modern went suddenly
                              historic, and for a time we ate and slept and lived in a combined aura of abrasives,
                              blowpipes and classical Latin, all working together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d6976e1646">Was it worth it? To our way of thinking immeasurably so. I got in all sorts of good
                              licks on design, pupils building up a deficiency in their graphic vocabularies, a
                              new craft interest was added to the school equipment, and the Latin department had
                              a lot of grand fun gathering material in the original, and were hard pressed by the
                              demands of the pupils, believe it or not, for more material to translate.

                           <p id="d6976e1649">That is what I mean by integration—useful activity under enjoyable conditions for
                              all concerned departmental barriers down, pupils and teachers all working together
                              for a common interest. It is a thing possible in any school, no matter how large,
                              or how poor. If you look you can always find opportunities offering themselves to
                              you. It means work, more preparations, but when you consider the worth of the projects
                              you could further, it seems to me that you can ill afford to let them go by, noticed
                              perhaps, but unheeded.

                           at the West Chester State Teachers’ College, the Art Department has recently conducted
                           an experiment in exhibition methods.

                           in the college gallery, was distributed about the campus where the pictures would
                           fit into the general decorative scheme and where they would be seen by all the students
                           as they went about their daily affairs.

                           successful in many respects than the exhibitions held in the art gallery. Students,
                           while waiting between classes or loitering in the corridors before dinner, studied
                           the pictures, talked about them and formed opinions which they expressed more freely
                           than in the more austere atmosphere of the gallery.

                           they unearthed, but also sketches the native workers and characters of the town—and
                           with a sense of caricature and humor.

                           you don’t like the average Art Book. So you think they are phoney. Well, what in blazes
                           do you like?” That sort of stopped us for awhile, but after considerable searching,
                           we unearthed (fourth row up, second book, in our library) Sir Joshua Reynolds’ time
                           tested “Discourses,” written in the XVIII century. It is not only a classic of English
                           Literature, but contains a wealth of material which we believe to be of immeasurable
                           value to the artists of today.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1846">The Discourses arose out of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ election in 1768 as President of
                           the then newly created Royal Academy of Art. One of his duties was to “say something”
                           at the annual distribution of prizes. Here arose the idea of giving an annual discourse
                           or lecture on art in general. There are fifteen discourses in all, each representing
                           a year of his Presidency of the Royal Academy. To be sure, there is much to find fault
                           with in Sir Joshua’s theories in the light of modern art education, but on the other
                           hand, we unearthed some tid-bits such as the following, “A facility in composing a
                           lively and what is called a masterly handling of the chalk and pencil are, it must
                           be confessed, captivating qualities to young minds and become of course the objects
                           of their ambition; they endeavour to imitate these dazzling excellencies which they
                           will find no great labor in attaining . . . by this useless industry they are excluded
                           from all power of advancing in all excellence. Whilst boys they are arrived at their
                           utmost perfection; they have taken the shadow for the substance and make the mechanical
                           facility the chief excellence of the art, which is only an ornament, and of the merit
                           of which few painters themselves are judges. This seems to me to be one of the most
                           dangerous sources of corruption and I speak of it from experience. Academy Directors
                           are frequently pleased with this premature dexterity in their pupils and praise their
                           dispatch at the expense of their correctness.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1849">Take heed, oh ye moderns, and beware the facile painter. That his art may be a sham
                           thing of surface only, is as true today as it was when Sir Joshua Reynolds, in the
                           middle of the XVIII century, warned of the pitfall.

                           by the Oxford University Press in the series known as “The World’s Classics.” We urge
                           you to include this book in your art library. You will find its value will exceed

                           and the poisoning of the public taste with French painting. Admitting that from the
                           point of view of nationalism, it is French, nevertheless, it IS painting. Here in
                           America we have, of course, Americans. Some of them have ideas of an illustrative
                           nature. Some of them have good ideas on illustration. But painters? There’s another
                           tough job for a modern Diogenes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1890">Shall we glance at the current exhibition of “American Art” at the Art Alliance? For
                           example, there is such a stalwart as John Steuart Curry whose sensational American
                           scene has all the wallop and plastic quality of an 1850 daguerrotype. Cézanne gazes
                           up from where he spends his time fiercely trying to organize his canvas, Matisse glances
                           up from his absorption with color relations—and there high above on wide, bright wings,
                           soars Mr. Curry, high in the blue of advanced illustration. Is his the art for the
                           sample bag of American salesmanship that you mentioned? Or Burchfield? Hand tinted
                           photographs of the American suburb? Or anything else like these two? American salesmanship
                           might well try to peddle these in France. And might succeed, for after all, Daguerre,
                           the inspiration of these paintings, was a Frenchman.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d6976e1893">But it might be a better idea to have something good to sell. Hesitantly we advance
                           the names of some of the minor lights who were born before the vice of American art
                           nationalism. Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Miro—these inherit and build on a
                           growing idea about painting, overlooking (and are they mistaken?) the representative
                           American idea fixé of colored narrative. We seriously feel that the painting of the
                           American scene is undoubtedly American scene in appearance—but structurally and in
                           essence it ignores both the “thing in itself” of our time and the great evolution
                           and ideas of painting; that the great sources—El Greco, Giotto, Raphael, Goya—have
                           been brushed aside for the brown sauce descriptivism of Bougereau.

                        <p id="d6976e1896">As for the venal French art dealer. He doubtless was cunning—but he sold, by and large,
                           what is fairly well recognized as art. The American dealer has adopted his methods
                           and emulated his astuteness, but deals less in valid painting and much more in noise
                           and confusion.

                        <p id="d6976e1899">Apropos of your mention of Cézanne’s paintings. One of them is here to be looked at
                           in the museum. It might even be SEEN. The ability to see beyond the appearance of
                           a Raphael Madonna would serve well enough. And there is enough aesthetic dynamite
                           there to warrant the effort. In fact, one may even discover the quintessence of Picasso’s
                           debt to Cézanne. And while we have heard vague rumors of another and better Cézanne
                           in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, we can at least look at this one.

                           at the University of Pennsylvania, he is learning the elements of taking things apart
                           and putting them together again. By diligent application throughout the summer, he
                           and a host of other boys nursed the flivver back to circulation again, and on the

                           each case this failure was due not so much to lack of public support, as to the unguarded
                           literary style (if I may call it “literary”) of the editorials and submitted articles

                           decorative manner. The woodwork and part of the wall space is a soft, cool green,
                           the drapes echoing this green and the bright tones of the bird panels.
