                           set of inner walls which can be dismantled when not in use—at the Drexel Institute
                           of Technology. The gift of Edward P. Simon, the new museum device is used to advantage
                           to display a splendid collection of over one hundred prints by American and foreign
                           photographers.

                           this exhibit unusually interesting, the display of the original print with the final
                           enlargement, as in Dr. Clarence Kern’s study of a New England church. The comparison
                           of the amount of detail in the two prints provides an illuminating commentary on the
                           methods of the miniature cameraman. Again, in Dana Mitchell’s still life, onions rolled
                           out of a bushel basket, it is of interest to note the improvement in composition made
                           by cutting off a section of the negative.

                           Chiappero, Donald Miner’s series of sand patterns, the composition in water reflections
                           by the Philadelphian, Alfred A. DeLardi, and the revealing portrait of Alfred Stieglitz,
                           dean of American photographers, by William Hill Field.

                           support it.

                           America. Undeniably the Pepper-Coffee proposal has hung a veil of suspicion between
                           the Conservatives and any proposal for the establishment of a Federal Arts Bureau.
                           Nevertheless it is conceivable that a Bureau could be created which would benefit
                           art as a whole. This may be the time to do it if it is ever to be done. Can we, whether
                           we be radical or conservative, swallow our distrust, concentrate on the idea at hand,
                           join forces with all who are interested in art, and do the job?

                           a major adjustment to the current enormous sociological and economic changes.

                           he had no further desire to paint. The statement may be extreme, but certainly many
                           artists, visiting the Settlement Music School’s Exhibition at Broad and Spruce Sts.
                           will more than admire the free imagination in which the sculpture, drawings, and paintings
                           in this show have been conceived.

                        <p id="d47409e252">Characterized by great strength and vitality, the sculpture displays a comprehensive
                           knowledge of the structure and plasticity of the human figure. The little painted
                           clay statuettes by the younger classes, the wood-carvings, the large figure pieces—all
                           show a highly original manipulation of masses and planes. Typical of this truly creative
                           spirit is a seated woman, expressing, through elongated forms, a deep weariness and
                           dejection. Finished with a surface resembling that of turquoise bronze, this piece
                           of sculpture achieves unusual unity of form and idea.

                        <p id="d47409e255">The oils, mostly by children of about ten years old, have a fresh, naive quality.
                           With great honesty of approach, they objectify the child’s emotions and opinions concerning
                           his own world. The eviction of a family, a group of bright-eyed children, factory
                           workers—these are but a few of the subjects the children have creatively reworked
                           into expressive and stimulating pictures.

                           of these schools. Nevertheless the show was gay and stimulating, and bespeaks an excellent
                           cooperative spirit between educators. The schools represented were: Germantown Academy,
                           William Penn Charter, Miquon, Haverford, Shipley, Moorestown Friends’, Friends’ Select,

                           <p id="d47409e335">The artist is beset by more than one problem over which he has no control.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e338">One of the most prominent is the flourishing art auction of today. The theory of the
                              auction—the loot to the highest bidder—means generally an unworthy price, in fact
                              a reasonable chance of getting an actual treasure for a song.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e341">Bougereaus, Sullys and Morans have recently been auctioned for absurdly low sums of
                              money, and the art-buying public’s reaction to such an experience is far from healthy
                              for the modern artist.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e344">Principally, it places in his none too rosy path an added obstacle—it furnishes his
                              potential buyers with a reason for not buying from him. It may even force his prices
                              to the auctioneer’s level. And, lastly, he must struggle all the harder for recognition.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e348">The auctioneer is not the artists’s friend.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e351">The idea of circulating picture clubs is likewise none too happy for the artist. At
                              first consideration it may appear a boon, but deeper penetration reveals more than
                              one flaw in its construction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e354">It may be argued that this plan enables an artist to attain greater recognition by
                              means of the enlarged audience offered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e357">We do not believe that his audience is increased thereby, for subscribers to this
                              plan are generally gallery-goers and would see the artist’s work in any case. While
                              purchasers may be found in this manner, it is more likely to discourage purchasing,
                              inasmuch as the painting finds its way into a home for a mere rental. And again, to
                              many members, variety may be the spice of art.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e360">The idea of a purchasing fund established by the club is admirable, so far as it goes.
                              In fact, it is doubtless agreeable to many artists whose work has been sold. To the
                              majority of artist-contributors, however, it means no return.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e363">In a word, under the plan of a circulating picture club, the artist contributes his
                              stock-in-trade, bears the brunt of its usage, and is paid nothing for it unless he
                              be one of the few whose work has been purchased. Furthermore, the club collects dues
                              from its members on the strength of his contributions. And it is inclined to reduce
                              the purchasing inclination of its public.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e367">This is obviously an inadequate system. The artist must in some way be reimbursed
                              for his cooperation—possibly in point of royalties. Otherwise, most artist-members
                              give all and receive naught.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e370">The current exhibition of Contemporary Russian Graphic Arts at the School of Industrial
                              Art, sponsored by the American Russian Institute, is not only a vital and stimulating
                              show, but one of great variety of thought and treatment. Included are illustrated
                              books (mostly highly imaginative and ingenious in design), educational posters (bearing
                              the stamp of advanced graphic conception), wood cuts (black and white and in color),
                              and photos of stage sets augmented by color prints of scenic and costume designs.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e373">The last named should prove of extraordinary interest to all theatre-lovers. The photos
                              reveal the sumptuous quality of modern Russian sets, and have been made at the Moscow
                              Art Theatre, Vakhtangou Theatre and Kamering Theatre, among others. Fantasy and vivid
                              design accentuate the color prints of theatrical costumes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e376">Much pictorial ingenuity and cleverness is to be found in the wood cuts. Vladimir
                              Favorsky, that old pillar of Russian wood-cut—for whom we have tremendous admiration—is
                              well represented with his wealth of forms and linear patterns so personal to himself,
                              while Kravchenko and Sternberg take next place in point of technical excellence and
                              individuality of composition.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e379">The lithographs of Adolph Dehn, now at the Carlen Galleries, are as provocative as
                              usual. One sees them and is sufficiently disturbed to return to them—excellent proof
                              of a good print.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e382">Judging by this show, the artist has two phases: delineation of character devoid of
                              flattery, and a purely pictorial eye cast upon landscape.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e386">In the former we find principally an uncompromising bitterness of approach to humanity
                              and its foibles, interpreted with a highly individualized textural sense plus the
                              ability to make a line say all the unpleasant things this artist thinks about people.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e389">This approach is principally exemplified in such prints as “All for a Piece of Meat”,
                              “We Speak English”, “Applause”, “Lohengrin” and “The Little Sinner”.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e392">Dehn’s non-figure prints lean more than a little toward Japanesque pictorial thought,
                              to which “Storm” and “Niagara Falls” bear ample testimony.

                              work at the Artists Union with a group exhibition of drawings, pastels and water colors.
                              Lisa Langley presents a group of green landscapes in which the undulating hill and
                              field scene is interpreted with a compact simplicity. Nat Koffman’s wash drawings
                              attain a certain sculpturesque quality through emphasis on large rounded areas. Herschel
                              Levit’s charcoal portraits for Dostoyevsky’s “Crime and Punishment” amply express
                              the fierceness and passion of their inspiration. Hubert Mesibov has contributed a
                              group of very interesting water colors. Superficially chaotic, these paintings, in
                              their very formlessness reveal a definite pattern. Abe Chanin’s water colors, many
                              done during his recent study in Florida, use deep inner-glow colors with a certain
                              fierceness of design.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e404">Interesting as are the revelations of these five distinct personalities, the important
                              point about this show would seem to be its purpose—to put living art within the reach
                              of lower-income people. With prices ranging from $2 to $35, a vastly greater number
                              of people will be able to afford original art works. In this particular show, the
                              media chosen are in themselves inexpensive, thus making possible some profit as well
                              as an altruistic gesture for the artist.

                           <p id="d47409e407">Competently executed and endowed with a quiet charm, Mary Butler’s oils and water
                              colors, on view at Harcum Junior College, present landscapes and flower pieces of
                              pleasing design and color. “River and Beach, Ogunquit,” a pattern of dark blue sea,
                              the dark blue curve of the river, rocks, and flat, grey sand, and “Autumn in the Berkshires”,
                              vertical cornstalks evenly spaced against a low blue mountain, are typical of her
                              oils. In “Cathedral Crag—A Wet Day” the water color fully recreates the mist clinging
                              to the peak. Color and form have a proper indefiniteness.

                           <p id="d47409e410">Jointly exhibiting with Miss Butler is Benton Spruance who shows a characteristically
                              exciting group of lithographs, among them the familiar series “The People Work”, cross-sections
                              of the labor of a great city. An artist steeped in the contemporary world, Spruance
                              reshapes the matter and mood of his environment into organic relationships. “Road
                              from the Shore” and “Highway Holiday,” terrifying visualizations of our mania for
                              speed, repeat the madness of the theme in the long, sweeping distortions of machine
                              and human forms.

                              are a record of Philadelphia scenes. All the squares and green places, the skylines,
                              the buildings and boulevards, have been noted down with an unfailing clarity of color
                              and shape.

                              expected a far more radical Joseph Grossman than is revealed in his current exhibition
                              at the Modern Galleries. Here are simply conceived landscapes and still lifes, painted
                              with a texture and color range that suggest pastel. “The Lone Tree,” a single tree
                              casting the shadow of noon in a field, focuses summer heat. “The Old Barn,” handled
                              with less restraint and more vitality, convincingly portrays the rural scene.

                           <p id="d47409e420">In a group of fourteen oils at the Women City’s Club, Arrah Lee Gaul shows herself
                              to be a painter in very clear, clean color. “Desert,” a composition in the varying
                              colors of flat land areas accentuated by green patches of sage brush exemplifies both
                              her methods and her point of view. This is not the death-bearing desert of O’Keefe,
                              but merely a country of great stillness and tranquillity. It is with this mood that
                              she composed the majority of canvases in the exhibition.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e423">One of the finest of current exhibitions is John Folinsbee’s at the Women’s University
                              Club. A very free painter, using strong color and composition Folinsbee gives a new
                              and dramatic significance to the Pennsylvania landscape. “Dark Hollow Road” is typical
                              of this approach. Against an overcast sky, rise great incandescent trees of fall,
                              throwing deep shadows on a narrow road and little group of houses. The beauty here
                              is sinister, man and the fragile buildings he erects being dwarfed by the immensity
                              of the storm filled sky, the gold trees, and the hills.

                           <p id="d47409e426">Also included in this show are a group of delightful child portraits. Broadly painted
                              and informally posed, they portray the inherent gravity and seriousness that young
                              children possess in repose.

                           <p id="d47409e429">A painter of various but always definite ability is June Groff, showing oils and water
                              colors at the A.C.A. Gallery. With methods ranging from the thick, almost paste-like
                              application of paint in “Circus Performer,” to the very thinly laid-on color of “Smoky
                              Mills” or “Fruit and Wine,” she reveals herself as still in the experimental stage,
                              but with a consistently thorough understanding of whatever manner she employs.

                              in greys, violets, and deep reds; the small flower picture “Anemones”—these are among
                              the most satisfying canvases in the exhibition.

                           <p id="d47409e444">Julius Bloch’s one man show of oils at the Art Alliance is the exposition of a large-minded
                              artist, who looks at men, white or colored, first as human beings, and then as members
                              of a race. There is little essential difference between the portraits, “Hitchhiker,”
                              a white youth, and “Stevedore,” a negro laborer; both are symbols of physical and
                              mental exhaustion. The negro subjects who sat for the majority of canvases in this
                              exhibit, were not painted for purposes of satire, or humor, or propaganda, but for
                              themselves, as they possess dignity, and nobility.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e447">Bloch often, of course, displays a very real bitterness toward social practice, as
                              in “Lynching,” “Park Benches,” and “Prisoner,” but it is never mere incoherent protest.
                              The personal feeling of the artist has been sufficiently objectified to make good
                              art as well as good opinion. “Prisoners” is not the depiction of an isolated negro,
                              but a comprehensive expression of imprisonment in the abstract.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e450">A second one man show at the Art Alliance is that of Margaret Gest’s water colors
                              and pastels. Miss Gest, as appears from this group of paintings, is an interpreter
                              of mood and atmosphere, rather than of material fact. In “Rain and Cooler” we feel
                              the ominous tenseness that precedes a summer storm; in “Dark Grove” the dominant theme
                              is the mystery of this shadowed group of trees. “Rocks” a skillful combination of
                              abstract forms, is shot through with an almost physical sensation of strain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e453">A group of abstractions, “The Four Seasons,” visualizes the varying themes of the
                              year. Winter’s quiescence is seen through a horizontal design of greys and blacks;
                              the growth of spring, in shooting points of blue; the ripeness of summer, in a revolving
                              rose form; while the agitated red, black, and brown swirls of “Autumn” illustrate
                              the “Pestilence stricken multitudes” of Shelley’s poem.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e457">Replacing the all too prevalent blacks and browns of modern portraiture with light,
                              clear colors, Isaac Rader shows a group of minutely detailed, smoothly painted portraits
                              at Sessler’s. The subjects have been informally posed, usually in an interior setting
                              that attempts to reflect their personalities. Mark Twain is shown in an early American
                              kitchen, seated by a window framed in vines; Mrs. Rader, in a blue evening gown, stands
                              in a carefully described living room. The final impression, however, is of a too great
                              concentration on material surroundings, of a too great objectivity, rather than the
                              intended interpretation of the “inner man.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e460">The less carefully planned water colors, especially the child portraits, have more
                              spontaneity, and exhibit a more searching appraisal of the subjects.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e463">The eleven artists exhibiting at the Y.M. &amp; Y.W.H.A. have contributed a varied, and
                              generally excellent, group of paintings. If there be a common denominator it is that
                              of integrity, a quality equally apparent in Joe Hirsch’s satiric “Two Men” and in
                              Hortense Ferne’s unfinished, but thoroughly charming “Portrait Study”.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e466">Several of these eighteen paintings seem particularly outstanding. Henry Cooper’s
                              “After the Rehearsal” previously shown in this year’s Academy Annual, reiterates a
                              splendid realization of form and glowing color; “Reb Mnashe” a portrait by Samuel
                              Salko, demonstrates the transmutation of pure emotion into art. Harry Zion’s “Back
                              Bay,” soft blues and green seen through a summer haze, is one of the most satisfying
                              of the landscapes.

                              Art, on view at the Sketch Club, and embracing oils, water colors, pen and ink drawings,
                              pastels, ceramics, and masks, provides a lively review of student work in commercial
                              and fine art.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e476">Particularly interesting are the fashion drawings by Peggy Key and Gerry Snow. Smart,
                              fresh, they compare more than favorably with professional work in the field. Virginia
                              Kibler’s paintings, done in large planes and bold colors are outstanding among the
                              oils. The free, brilliant work by Helen Hartel, and the more quietly toned paintings
                              by Margaret Tifft present interesting contrasts in the water color section.

                           at the Philadelphia Art Alliance from 
                           <date id="d47409e893" when="--04-26">April 26th</date> to

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e900">Sr. Quintanilla’s early career, including parental opposition, the grand tour, the
                           slow growth of recognition, followed the general pattern associated with artists.
                           But he was a Spaniard and a Basque. He could not remain indifferent to the political
                           convulsions of his country. And so, in the spring of 1930, at the very hour when Alfonso
                           was deciding to leave the throne, Quintanilla was one of the crowd standing in the
                           plaza in front of the palace. It was an orderly crowd but the civil guard was drawn
                           up before the palace gates and their rifles were ready. The king was still in the
                           palace and no one knew what was going to happen until Quintanilla climbed up the wall
                           to a balcony and unfurled a great Republican flag. Fortunately, the issue had already
                           been decided within the palace and the civil guard was given no orders to fire, so
                           the bloodshed, which was so near, did not occur.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e903">For Quintanilla, one of the results of this exploit was a commission to paint the
                           murals in University City, that City planned as a grandiose monument to education
                           but destined to become a series of battered fortresses. Quintanilla’s murals could
                           be compared with the murals in Rockefeller Center, for his subject was the life of
                           his country, the sowers, the laborers, the tenders of machines, the teachers, the
                           scientists, painted into the walls with the firmness of color and design of an artist
                           unpreoccupied with self.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e907">He threw himself so unreservedly into the struggle on the side of the Spanish Government
                           and was so reckless in battle that the government, feeling his life as an artist was
                           too valuable to be lost, restrained him by putting him into diplomatic work. Nevertheless
                           he was able to visit all the fronts and his exhibition consists of over a hundred
                           drawings done for the most part either under fire or at the scene of an air raid.
                           They range from the defense of Madrid at the opening of the war, through the Toledo,
                           Jarama and Belchite campaign, to the operations around Teruel last January. Taken
                           together, they form a complete picture of the war up to now, from the Loyalist side.
                           The collection is probably unique in the world, for the drawings of military action
                           have been actually done from life.

                           found that the Bureau as proposed would be expensive and cumbersome, would not be
                           free of politics, and would tend to continue Government subsidy of art projects to
                           the detriment of art as a whole. The committee concludes that “this bill contains
                           much that is questionable if not dangerous and we advise against its being introduced
                           at this time.”

                           Electric Company. Symbol of light and the efficiency of electric service he is the
                           brain child and sole property of a gentleman named Ash Collins. While working for
                           a southern utility he conceived the idea of a fitting pictorial expression that would
                           typify electricity in all its branches. He contacted an artist and after a great deal
                           of revision Reddy was born. His owner had no trouble selling him down the river for
                           a generous royalty. At present the ubiquitous little fellow is capering for no less
                           than seventy utilities. He gets around too, for we find him speaking Spanish and Portuguese
                           in South America. Collins is reported eyeing the European market for his little protege.
                           He keeps a staff of twenty people, including artists busy in Birmingham, Alabama.
                           Reddy is drawn locally by free-lance Ned Steel of Willow Grove, who is probably the
                           only local artist who had the pleasure of doing art work for years in the salubrious
                           climate of the Hawaiian Islands.

                           of his life last week when a local banquet drew a bevy of ring greats to this city.
                           He saw his idol, the great Battling Nelson after a lapse of many years, and in an
                           atmosphere that fairly bloomed in cauliflower, entertained a group of quondam ringsters
                           in his apartment. He was a little puzzled as to whether or not it would be proper
                           to throw some resin on the floor.

                           Mrs. Hunter told of its founding in 1897. In March of that year, a group of prominent
                           women artists, among them Cecelia Beaux, Harriet Sartain, Violet Oakley and Jessie
                           Wilcox Smith, banded together in a room of the Fuller Building to form the first recognized
                           association of women artists. In 1898 they held an exhibition of color work—the beginning
                           of a long line of annual shows. The civic activities of the Club, their war work,
                           such as camouflaging ships, the honors awarded to members, annual outings—all were
                           touched upon in this review of the Plastic Club’s past.

                           amusing stories of “Oriental Nights” and showing a fascinating set of old photographs.

                           than its past, Miss A. Margaretta Archambault spoke about her and the Plastic Club’s
                           work in promoting rotary exhibitions.

                        <p id="d47409e1545">It is perhaps not an exaggeration to say that laymen are taking a livelier interest
                           in education today than at any time in national history. Meetings such as those recently
                           held at Atlantic City have attracted the scrutiny and the comments of non-professional
                           observers to an extent which is amazing to teachers who have accustomed themselves
                           to thinking that affairs of education are dull stuff to the general mind. Interest
                           is especially sharp on controversial issues which appear to be dividing educators
                           into hostile camps.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1548">Shades of the modernist fundamental conflict in religion of the last decade! We have
                           the old forces at work socking each other in the same old way but in a different terrain.
                           In education it is the liberal against the conservative, the Progressives against
                           the Essentialists. Dorothy Thompson in a recent article professed to see in this hostile
                           alignment the rising of a revolt of the parents—together with many teachers—against
                           the fads and frills, the ineptitudes and absurdities of “progressive” education. Children
                           are not being taught manners or morals, arithmetic or spelling, history or punctuation;
                           they will do nothing they do not wish to do, they rarely do well the things they wish
                           to do, and they usually wish to do only the things that are easy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1552">As a teacher in one of these so-called progressive schools I am, of course, convinced
                           of the rightness of the progressive ideology. Far be it from me to define this ideology
                           for the satisfaction of anyone in or out of the schools. But from the welter of words,
                           ideas, principles, and concepts emerges one central fact about the Progressive movement
                           which no one can honestly deny: it is a movement designed to help teachers and administrators
                           “get at” the individual child in order to give him the help he needs. It is spurred
                           on by the conviction that the old methods under which we adults were trained did little
                           to discover the individual and less to assist him. It is convinced that head cramming,
                           group drills, the A-B-C-D-E marking system, uniform requirements for all, and uniform
                           standards for all are usually more effective in concealing a lad than in revealing
                           him; it does not swallow and digest the old assumption that knowledge of facts means
                           virtue in action and thinking. On the positive side it simply says: find out about
                           the youngster—his attitudes, abilities, and interests; then help him to live and grow
                           as a person in a world of his fellows. If there is anything undemocratic, communistic,
                           or “subversive” in this doctrine, the burden of proof is on its critics.

                           <p id="d47409e1589">Another brush with the French police occurred one time when I was working on a feature
                              story with pictures of Parisian night life in Montmartre and Montparnasse. The spectacle
                              of gargons de café or agents de police propelling a struggling and usually tipsy café
                              girl from the bar to the curb was a not infrequent real life picture. But it always
                              happened when I was minus my camera. I decided to stage this myself in the interest
                              of the series and I looked around for a likely habituee of the Quarter who might be
                              persuaded to be thrown out of a cafe for Art’s sake . . . and a hundred francs. There
                              was a girl whom I shall call Mickey, because that is not her name, and who I shall
                              say came from Holland because that is where she came from. I was agreeably surprised
                              to find her falling in with the idea quite enthusiastically. We took a table on the
                              fringe of a popular and crowded Montparnasse cafe, ordered a couple of Pernods, and
                              endeavoured to bribe a waiter or two, who knew Mickey, to do their strongarm stuff.
                              They were not to be cajoled, however, so we finished our drinks and I offered my companion
                              the francs anyway. She ordered another Pernod, looked at me and said, “Do you want
                              to get that picture?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1592">“Yes,” I said.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1595">“Then get out there to the curb. Keep your camera out of sight, and watch me.” A game
                              gal, that. I got into a taxi at the curb. The top was down and I opened the camera
                              in the bottom of the tonneau.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1598">Mickey finished her drink calmly, and then reached over to a neighboring table, snatched
                              the hat from the head of an astonished American, removed the hatband and threw the
                              hat into the street. A couple of tables and chairs followed the hat with magnificent
                              abandon. The Café terrace was in an instant uproar. People were on their feet, standing
                              on chairs and table tops to watch and cheer as Mickey really warmed up to her work.
                              Waiters dashed forward.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1602">“Call a couple of cops,” said the embattled lady, “I want to be arrested.” With that
                              she coolly hurled another chair across the pavement. Her gestures were grand. A blue-coated
                              policeman shouldered his way through the crowd. The waiters were nonplussed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1605">“One policeman’s not enough to arrest me.” Mickey declared indignantly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1608">That’s why French agents de police generally travel in pairs; it is beneath Gallic
                              personal dignity to submit to arrest by one man. Two police, of course, outnumber
                              one and individual pride is thus preserved.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47409e1611">Another agent appeared and they obligingly dragged their dramatically struggling prisoner
                              to the curb while the camera clicked. There they good-naturedly let her free, but
                              I saw too late, as I pulled her into my cab, that one of them had spotted my camera.
                              He tumbled to the trick at once as my chauffeur stepped on the gas, and they both
                              promptly stepped on the running-board and directed the driver to the nearest police
                              station, which happened to be just around the corner. There we were hailed before
                              the Commissaire who demanded to know what it was all about. I exhibited my press card
                              and explained that I was merely taking a shot for a series of night life pictures.
                              He examined my passport and carte d’identitie and after assuring him that my pictures
                              and article intended no disrespect to the French police I was permitted to go. Not
                              so Mickey. Unfortunately she did not have her passport or identity card with her and
                              stayed in durance vile while I scouted around to find her papers and effected her
                              release. The French police are invariably charming to foreigners and blessed as a
                              rule with a keen sense of humor, but visiting firemen had best be possessed of their
                              papers.

                        <p id="d47409e1644">Three cheers for Walt Kuhn for preserving the story of the Armory Show for future
                           generations. Mr. Kuhn, who was executive secretary of the exhibition, has told the
                           story of that momentous show in a little pamphlet dedicated to the American artist
                           of the future. Lucidly written, it explains the conditions that led up to the show
                           as well as the concrete results. Plans for the exhibition sent Mr. Kuhn to Germany,
                           Holland, France and England where he collected pertinent examples of the great moderns
                           of the day. Mr. Kuhn modestly gives much of the credit for the Armory Show’s phenomenal
                           success to the great American painter, Arthur B. Davies, who, Mr. Kuhn tells us, financed
                           most of the exhibition from his own pocket.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1647">As many of us know, the exhibition was held in the 165th Regiment Infantry Building
                           in New York. The examples of art it fostered gave America its first opportunity to
                           view the work of such men as Matisse, Dufy, Van Gogh. In large measure it was responsible
                           for the purchase of a Cezanne by the Metropolitan Museum. Following its tremendous
                           success in New York, the show went to Chicago where it enjoyed similar enthusiasm,
                           and then to Boston where it was not so happily received.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1650">The author attributes much of the modernity of design of our present apparel, automobiles,
                           aeroplanes, etc. to the influence of that eye-opening exhibition of 1913. We understand
                           that this pamphlet is not for sale, but we suspect that Mr. Kuhn would be only too
                           glad to forward you a copy as he did your reviewer, who wrote to him at 112 E. 18th
                           St., New York City, enclosing postage.

                        <p id="d47409e1669">Another red lake pigment, perhaps one of the oldest dye-stuffs known, is Kermes. It
                           is said to have been used as a dye in the time of Moses. Pliny, A. D. 77, calls it
                           “coccigranum” and speaks of it as greatly valued in the days of the Roman Empire as
                           a dye-stuff. The Venetian Scarlet of the Middle Ages was also obtained from Kermes.
                           The pigments prepared from it in ancient times were usually precipitated on a base
                           of chalk or gypsum and consequently appear more opaque than the modern transparent
                           alumina base lakes. This deep crimson coloring matter of yellowish-red hue is a product
                           of the insect Coccus Ilicis, resembling the Cochineal, the source of the rich and
                           brilliant Carmine since about 1500 A. D. The Kermes Red and Carmine do not show the
                           desirable stability of the Madder Lakes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1672">Another rather dull deep red lake pigment in use, at this time, was Lac Lake. It and
                           Kermes were almost entirely displaced by the introduction of the more permanent Madder
                           Lakes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1676">Dragon’s Blood, a deep red-brown colored resin, was called “Cinnabar” by the ancients
                           and was also mentioned by Pliny in his natural history. It is now used principally
                           as a coloring for lacquers, varnishes, toilet articles, etc., but seldom as an artist’s
                           color. It exudes from wounds made in the bark of an Asiatic tree. The color, although
                           rather fugitive under prolonged direct sunlight exposure, was principally valued for
                           glazing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1679">From the very earliest times, prehistoric man made use of the prehistoric man made
                           use of the natural red earths for purposes of decoration. These red ochres were selected
                           for their beauty of color, ranging from cool bluish to warm yellowish reds. Early
                           reference in ancient Grecian and Roman times was made to particularly bright varieties
                           under the names Rubics and Sinopis.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47409e1682">It is very confusing to trace the history of some of the early pigments. For instance,
                           Sinopis is sometimes described in early manuscripts as an especially bright red ochre.
                           Again, we find the natural mineral “cinnabar” also given this name. Dragon’s Blood
                           also appears under the name “cinnabar”. Pliny refers correctly to vermilion as “minium”,
                           which name is now given to red lead.
