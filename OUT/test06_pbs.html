                              	  privileged to live in Space.

                           <p id="d6e49">Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines,

                              	  instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely
                              	  about, on or in the surface, but without the power of rising
                              	  above or sinking below it, very much like shadows—only hard
                              	  with luminous edges—and you will then have a pretty correct
                              	  notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years ago,
                              	  I should have said “my universe:” but now my mind has been
                              	  opened to higher views of things.

                              	  find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view, and
                              	  at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of
                              	  the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a
                              	  Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval
                              	  at all, and will have become, so far as you can see, a
                              	  straight line.

                           <p id="d6e64">The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the

                              	  out from pasteboard. As soon as you look at it with your eye
                              	  on the edge of the table, you will find that it ceases to
                              	  appear to you as a figure, and that it becomes in appearance
                              	  a straight line. Take for example an equilateral
                              	  Triangle—who represents with us a Tradesman of the
                              	  respectable class. Figure 1 represents the Tradesman as you
                              	  would see him while you were bending over him from above;
                              	  figures 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see
                              	  him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on the
                              	  level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level
                              	  of the table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you
                              	  would see nothing but a straight line.

                              	  or other acquaintances comes towards us in Flatland. As

                              	  as to make shadows, we have none of the helps to the sight
                              	  that you have in Spaceland. If our friend comes closer to us
                              	  we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes
                              	  smaller; but still he looks like a straight line; be he a
                              	  Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you
                              	  will—a straight Line he looks and nothing else.

                              	  impossible for us to determine the North in the usual way;
                              	  but we have a method of our own. By a Law of Nature with us,
                              	  there is a constant attraction to the South; and, although
                              	  in temperate climates this is very slight—so that even a
                              	  Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs
                              	  northward without much difficulty—yet the hampering effort
                              	  of the southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as
                              	  a compass in most parts of our earth. Moreover,

                              	  (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from the
                              	  North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have
                              	  the guidance of the houses, which of course have their
                              	  side-walls running for the most part North and South, so
                              	  that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North. In the
                              	  country, where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees
                              	  serve as some sort of guide. Altogether, we have not so much
                              	  difficulty as might be expected in determining our
                              	  bearings.

                              	  attraction is hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly

                              	  stationary for hours together, waiting till the rain came
                              	  before continuing my journey. On the weak and aged, and
                              	  especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction
                              	  tells much more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex,
                              	  so that it is a point of breeding, if you meet a Lady on the
                              	  street, always to give her the North side of the way—by no
                              	  means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you
                              	  are in rude health and in a climate where it is difficult to
                              	  tell your North from your South.

                              	  to us alike in our homes and out of them, by day and by
                              	  night, equally at all times and in all places, whence we
                              	  know not. It was in old days, with our learned men, an
                              	  interesting and oft-investigate question, “What is the
                              	  origin of light?” and the solution of it has been repeatedly
                              	  attempted, with no other result than to crowd our lunatic
                              	  asylums with the would-be solvers. Hence, after fruitless
                              	  attempts to suppress such investigations indirectly by
                              	  making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in
                              	  comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them.
                              	  I—alas, I alone in Flatland—know now only too well the
                              	  true solution of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge
                              	  cannot be made intelligible to a single one of my
                              	  countrymen; and I am mocked at—I,

                              	  maddest of the mad! But a truce to these painful
                              	  digressions: let me return to our homes.
