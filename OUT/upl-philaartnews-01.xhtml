                           Museum, that Philadelphia is privileged to present the first great one-man show of
                           the French
                           Realist, Honoré Daumier, ever to be viewed in the United States.

                        <p id="d77246e248">While much of the work has come from abroad, many of our own collectors have added
                           generously to
                           the exhibit. Mr. Lessing J. Rosenwald, of our own city, is a notable example, as his
                           collection of
                           the artist’s lithographs has been drawn upon extensively.

                        <p id="d77246e252">The Exhibition is a fine tribute to a great man and does full justice to his ability,
                           for there
                           have been no hasty scribblings included merely because of the artist’s signature,
                           as is
                           unfortunately so often the case with important exhibits.

                        <p id="d77246e255">The show contains many fine examples of the artist’s sculpture, a medium that lends
                           itself
                           well to his caricatures.

                        <p id="d77246e258">There is a sketch of Don Quixote, composed of a few lines applied with a brush brimming
                           with ink.
                           The result is as alive and full of action as any example of Daumier’s work to be seen
                           in the
                           exhibit. There is also an illustration in oil of Don Quixote—as sombre and brooding
                           as a
                           Beethoven symphony. Those of us who were reared on Doré illustrations will recall
                           that prolific
                           craftsman’s interpretation of Don Quixote and will be struck, no doubt, by the great
                           similarity between his and Daumier’s conceptions of the famous character.

                        <p id="d77246e261">For achievement in pure expression, we nominate the wash-drawing, “Connoisseurs.”
                           By the posturing of the three central figures in this drawing, the artist has told
                           his
                           story—an interesting problem masterfully met and overcome.

                        <p id="d77246e264">We were interested to see a wash drawing of “Corot Sketching.” We like to think of
                           these two great contemporaries meeting and discussing their respective ideals and
                           aspirations.

                        <p id="d77246e267">In “The Sideshow,” a water color of circus life, Daumier has captured much the same
                           feeling that haunts the eyes of Goya’s dwarfs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e271">“Le Plaidoyer” shows Daumier’s skill in suggesting details with a few
                           strokes of his able brush. The tiny heads in the background of the picture, although
                           small and much
                           in shadow, each has an entirely different and quite independent character.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e274">Daumier’s people are as vital today as they were when they were set down by him for
                           us.
                           That vitality exists only because of his deep understanding of his subject . . . Man.
                           His sympathetic comprehension existed as a result of his own sorrows that made him
                           one with those he
                           drew. Compassionate, universal in his feeling, Daumier could, in an instant, turn
                           like a tiger and
                           utterly destroy with scathing satire . . . biting as acid.

                        <p id="d77246e285">Art, to Daumier, was essentially a means to an end. It offered a medium through which
                           he could
                           air the problems and injustices of the day . . . to his greatest satisfaction and
                           with the most skill. His was a work with a purpose. Truly, it is purpose that makes
                           great work, as
                           well as great men. It is purpose that creates ageless works of art.

                        <p id="d77246e288">Because Daumier had that purpose, and because men’s foibles and passions remain much
                           the
                           same despite “Twentieth Century Civilization,” Daumier lives. When men like him are
                           born (which is none too frequently) their medium is relatively unimportant, for no
                           matter what their
                           means of expression may be, they always make themselves felt.

                        <p id="d77246e322">His talents showed themselves early in life. At the age of 22 he had already won an
                           Academy of
                           the Fine Arts scholarship which made it possible for him to study in Paris with Bouguereau,
                           Ferrier,
                           and Doucet. Upon his return he was made an instructor at the Academy, which position
                           he had held
                           continuously since 1894. In 1905 he founded his nationally known Summer school of
                           painting at Rocky
                           Neck, Gloucester, Massachusetts.

                        <p id="d77246e358">One of our old pet theories, namely that a work of art executed in color should have
                           preeminently
                           the quality of color, seems to have fallen into mild disrepute at the 35th Annual
                           Water Color
                           Exhibition current at the PENNA. ACADEMY OF THE FINE ARTS. It’s an old dictum, possibly
                           even
                           a bit rusty, but still it answers our own emotional needs rather well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e361">We do not necessarily imply that the brilliance (and occasional rawness) residing
                           in the canvases
                           of LEGER, for instance, need be dubbed our only gift of color from the purse of genius.
                           Color has an
                           infinite number of ways—some bizarre, some harsh, others quite subtle—of leaping from
                           the brush of a painter to the surface of a canvas, thence into our own receptive eyes.
                           Nevertheless,
                           color must be welded into an enduring pictorial composition if it is to retain its
                           prestige even as
                           color.

                           are
                           suspiciously suggestive of halftone. Gone, for the most part, is the vivid glory of
                           the
                           impressionists, apparently without having permitted another quality to fill the vacancy.
                           What we
                           have here might possibly offer greater appeal to the homely Eakins than to the nervous

                           shall make no
                           attempt to deny it. We are completely at a loss, however, to cull another comment
                           concerning them.

                           tooth—namely: VERA WHITE (who manifests an improved sense of color relationships),

                           humor—both characteristic of this artist. WILLIAM SCHWARTZ finds a small town vibrant
                           with
                           the gray-green of leaves, while JAMES CHAPIN’S “SLEEPING WOMAN” expresses
                           herself with warm, plastic simplicity.

                           of the nude by G. P. Hunt we find simplicity and extraordinary directness, qualities

                           Emerton Heitland exhibits as much verve as ever, and Emil Bisttram his well known

                           Mildred Burrage’s still lifes of southern fruits say “pouff” to us and our

                        <p id="d77246e395">The work of Josef Presser has improved tremendously in the last few years. When first
                           he entered
                           the broad highway of public exhibition he was a gifted young man with a penchant for
                           the
                           Renaissance, which expressed itself in the general construction of his figures and
                           his antiquity of
                           sanguine, plus a wistful eye cast occasionally in the direction of the more recent
                           Renoir. Those who
                           care to observe the rehabilitation of time may do well to see Presser’s latest gouaches
                           and
                           drawings, 17 in number, at the PHILADELPHIA A. C. A. GALLERY. Here the wistful eye
                           is turning slowly
                           from Renoir to Rouault, and the effect is rather startling.

                        <p id="d77246e398">More than ever a deciple of the bold, expressive line, Presser shows “Kybele”, of
                           great volume, an interesting comparison to the staunch character studies such as
                           “Uriel”, “River Men”, “Tippler” and
                           “Riveter”. Rouault enters the scene with “Eclogue” and “Diomedes
                           Stallions”, rich in the suggestion of old stained glass. There are also several studies
                           reminiscent of Presser’s erstwhile “Renaissance” phase.

                        <p id="d77246e404">“Manhattan Andy”, an Irish terrier, posed for what we consider the best of the
                           group—and comes nearest to pictorial realization, by means of a green chair sliced
                           cleanly
                           out of the picture. “Gun Dogs” is a fine study of white bodies against misty gray
                           hills and water, and, aesthetically, a small sketch for a hunter-and-hound picture
                           is notable.
                           Incidentally, there is a solitary cat in the show—a Siamese, to be sure—and a startled
                           one. We wonder not all at the alertness of this particular feline, when one considers
                           her wealth of
                           canine and equine companionship.

                        <p id="d77246e407">Speaking of animals, Catherine Stewart Williams furnishes us with the very hue of
                           whimsey at the
                           WOMEN’S UNIVERSITY CLUB, WARWICK HOTEL. As water colors they are vivacious and manifest
                           a
                           refreshing sense of motion. It is nice to see gay things, and here they are. Giraffes
                           leer at us
                           suspiciously, polar bears seek the comfort of a tranquil iceberg in a turbulent sea
                           and sprightly
                           elephants take their iridescent carcasses to town, while monkeys sit philosophizing
                           in light green
                           trees and multicolored kangaroos hop merrily about. This is not just one picture—it
                           is the
                           whole exhibition.

                        <p id="d77246e411">Pen and ink, wash, and pencil are the media of Ruth Robinson, exhibiting a series
                           of drawings at
                           SESSLER’S. Spiritually a miniaturist; all subjects are approached with extraordinary
                           delicacy, and many of the drawings are quite minute. “A Journey into Rabelais’s
                           France”, by Albert Jay Nock, furnished the artist with ample material for her talent,
                           and a
                           number of pen and ink drawings made for the book are included in the show.

                        <p id="d77246e414">One wonders why Miss Robinson has not turned to printmaking—certainly an etching needle
                           is
                           all that is necessary. Many small drawings of fragments of architecture and sections
                           of facades cry
                           aloud for a plate instead of a cut.

                        <p id="d77246e417">The landscapes and architectural subjects are, on the whole, more successful than
                           the figure
                           pieces, although in such drawings as the Capital in the Musee Lapidaire at Tours a
                           distinct archaic
                           charm is evident. Our favorite is one of the smallest of the drawings, the “Kitchen
                           at
                           Fontevrault”, with its architectural suggestion of a beehive.

                        <p id="d77246e420">Elizabeth F. Washington is exhibiting oils and pastels at the QUAKER LADY. They are
                           evanescent
                           landscapes, in a quiet, eloquent mood. The trees are there, but there is a veil drawn
                           across them,
                           poetic and unobtrusive. Nymphs would probably be delighted with them.

                           on view at
                           the CARLEN GALLERIES. The most striking are those of John Costigan, both “The Bathers”
                           and “Figures with Cow”. Thomas Benton manifests his usual graphic buoyancy, John S.
                           de
                           Martelly contributes acrid social comment, Luigi Lucioni’s trees are as staunch as
                           ever, and
                           Paul F. Berdanier turns to the airplane in an arresting print.

                        <p id="d77246e426">The exhibition of W. P. A. posters and prints now to be seen at the ART CENTRE, WEST
                           CHESTER, is
                           by no means dull. Sponsored by the Chester County Art Association and the School Board
                           of West
                           Chester, there is much young blood to make a good show.

                        <p id="d77246e430">The prints offer much variety. Michael J. Gallagher and James Reid have accomplished
                           the
                           ambitious task of “Mural” woodcuts, executed in sections. The term
                           “mural” seems slightly hyperbolic in this instance but, for woodcuts, they are quite
                           large. Reid’s “The Seasons”, printed in two tones, is by far the better of the
                           two, and has all of the sprightly design inherent in this artist’s small cuts.
                           Gallagher’s companion piece, “Spring Plowing”, printed only in black, is
                           somewhat lacking in verve.

                        <p id="d77246e433">Sam J. Brown, a negro whose work has claimed the sympathetic attention of Mrs. Roosevelt,
                           shows a
                           lithographic “Writing Lesson” and proves that a little pick-a-ninny can be quite as
                           quaint as a little Mexican from the hand of Rivera. “Wash Girl” is cut in wood with
                           like quaintness but lacks finesse.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e436">Charles Gardner makes excellent use of the tint tool in his wood cuts, as has Salvatore
                           Pinto,
                           whose “Mills” is suggestive of Sheeler’s quantity and cleanliness of detail.
                           Julius Sommer’s lithographs “Gravel Pit” and “Overhead Conveyor”,
                           printed in six colors, are admirable in their dynamic design and among the best in
                           the show. Daniel
                           C. Rasmusson creates a lithographic “Pieta” in deeply expressive manner, and Hubert
                           B.
                           Mesibov views “Wrestlers” with a great deal of strength and a design more than
                           remotely similar to Orozco.

                        <p id="d77246e439">The posters are of a high standard and reveal not only variety but the general ability
                           of these
                           craftsmen to achieve unity of technical problem, style of work and the poster’s message.
                           Robert Muchley’s “Port of Philadelphia (II)” and Isadore Possoff’s
                           “In the Shaft” are outstanding. The exhibition includes designs for pottery, books,
                           cabinets and fabrics, the last both ingenious and practicable, qualities of which
                           many designs
                           cannot boast.

                           of the pictures being bought by Frederic March the movie star.

                           fact.
                           Photography is definitely here to stay as a modern medium of expression.

                        <p id="d77246e869">Artists have been quick to seize the possibilities of this lusty brother of the brush
                           so in
                           keeping with these modern times.

                        <p id="d77246e872">Let us consider, however, that photography should first of all be concerned with photography,
                           and
                           not ape other mediums.

                        <p id="d77246e875">Technical photography can be acquired by a study of the legion of text books, first
                           hand
                           experience and a liberal use of horse-sense. Virtually any equipment will do.

                        <p id="d77246e878">Taste is what distinguishes the artist from the snapshooter. Taste and a feeling for
                           design.

                        <p id="d77246e884">Simplicity is always the result of real taste. Why try to include in a picture everything
                           but the
                           kitchen sink? Grasp the important essentials and discard the superfluous. Let unimportant
                           detail be
                           subservient to mass.

                        <p id="d77246e891">The composition of a picture is so vital; continuity of line, a repeated motif, sensitive
                           rendering of color values, tones and rich luminous blacks . . . dare them.

                        <p id="d77246e900">Lighting is important, too. When making outdoor pictures, of course, lighting is not
                           entirely
                           within our control. This being the case it is necessary to meet this limitation with
                           the lore and
                           cunning of experience. Beautiful and startling effects are often realized by shooting
                           into the
                           light, thus back-lighting the image.

                        <p id="d77246e903">Indoors the light is absolutely under control, handling as easily and fluidly as water.
                           The usual
                           flat front lighting is thereby avoided and sculptured solidity attained.

                        <p id="d77246e907">Quality is arrived at as the sum total of thought, taste and good craftsmanship and
                           good
                           craftsmanship is to be expected anyway these days with the improved tools now available.

                        <p id="d77246e913">So let’s make quality our goal, handing future generations a fine permanent record
                           of the
                           scene and tempo of our day.

                           a
                           photographer’s point of view. Mr. Etting spoke first, admitting photography as a legitimate
                           member of the graphic arts. Comparing photography and painting, he stated that painting
                           was
                           “circumspect”, “requiring color and time”, while photography was
                           “simultaneous”, being a momentary picture of arrested action. Referring to the
                           exhibit, he stated that most of the best prints were made by Philadelphians, adding
                           that it was time
                           “we felt that Philadelphia will in time take a position in America comparable to that
                           of
                           Florence in Italy.”

                           photograph, as precision, composition, rhythm, line, but also counseled the would-be
                           photographer to
                           learn his technique so thoroughly that he could forget it.

                        <p id="d77246e989">Speight has identified himself with Philadelphia ever since he entered the Academy
                           of the Fine
                           Arts as a student seventeen years ago. He began making studies of Manayunk at that
                           time and has
                           continued to use this theme in such a distinguished way that he has won important
                           prizes in National
                           Exhibitions. He is an associate member of the National Academy of Design. He is represented
                           in the
                           permanent collections of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum
                           in New York,
                           and in other galleries and private collections. The Pennsylvania Academy has made
                           him a member of
                           its faculty.

                        <p id="d77246e992">Speight’s paintings are not inclined to prettiness but are always poignant. They possess
                           a
                           haunting poetic quality even when their subject matter is as dreary as can be imagined.
                           They reflect
                           clearly the spirit of the painter and are done in an idiom of his own creation.

                           art, Mr. Mumford advocates a stable environment, a certain margin of excess, and above
                           all
                           sufficient leisure both to create and to appreciate.

                        <p id="d77246e1010">He also commented on the present Administration’s attitude toward art, stating that

                           one of the
                           greatest triumphs of the last few years.

                        <p id="d77246e1314">A press which turned out “fractional currency”, a term applied to Civil War quarter
                           and half-dollar notes, for the Union government, is still used in the shop of George
                           H. Esquirell,
                           printer of engravings, at 715 Sansom Street. The press is commonly called a “spider”
                           press, because it is manipulated by handles at the side which resemble a web—or a
                           ship’s wheel. Technically it is a “side” press, as the printer stands at the
                           side instead of at the front of the machine.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1317">Esquirell bought three presses of this type, selling two, one of them to the Pennsylvania
                           Academy, where it was used for printing a small number of etchings until a short time
                           ago. His own
                           press he uses for both proving and making editions of etchings as well as for college
                           diplomas.

                        <p id="d77246e1498">The American Artists’ Professional League began experiments in the chemistry of pigments
                           several years ago. The League instituted a program for the standardization of paints,
                           advocating
                           that contents of tubes be stated on their labels.

                           Pigments, Orpi,

                           such as the cadmiums, have been cut or extended with harmless, inert substances, perhaps
                           slightly
                           reducing their brilliancy, but bringing their cost within reach of all.

                        <p id="d77246e1504">In the field of colored illustrations, many problems have been solved for the artist
                           by the
                           introduction of large size leads in many colors, by Kohinoor and others. Not only
                           is it possible to
                           use varied colored leads in a single holder, but you can obtain wide or narrow lines
                           by changing the
                           length of the lead and the inclination of the pencil. These leads are proving more
                           practical and
                           agreeable to use than the ordinary Polycolor pencil with its wooden covering. Their
                           size and density
                           prevent their breaking easily.

                           and easy to
                           adjust. If you have trouble with dirt getting into your holders, use rubber eye dropper
                           caps on
                           their tips. This keeps out tobacco crumbs and prevents your holder from sliding out
                           of your pocket
                           when you stoop over to pick up pins and pennies.

                           highly capable artist, Fry relinquishes a lucrative free lance practice to assume

                           they were a

                           Blake and
                           Shaw dissolved their association about a month ago. These two artistic emigrés from

                           who have been turning out layouts for Ayers, Lefton, and others, had only been in
                           town for about a
                           year. Dapper youngsters, they dressed in a manner that would rate a mention in Esquire.
                           It was
                           probably the only instance in this staid city when a couple of commercial artists
                           maintained a
                           studio in a swank penthouse.

                           of
                           Aitkin-Kynett. Wade stands well over six feet and weighs 230 pounds, and that’s a
                           lot of art
                           director to get in one agency. Incidentally Lane’s new beach house in the modern manner
                           is an
                           impressive addition to the art colony at Harvey Cedars, N. J.

                           with an
                           effective layout, the illustrations were eye-compelling.

                           commercial
                           artists with disgusting impartiality. Coming after what was an unusually busy summer,
                           it can only be
                           regarded as one of the many vagaries of a calling which is so often affected by mysterious
                           impulses.
                           Regarded as local rather than national, it nevertheless irks most of the knights of
                           the tracing
                           paper who hope that its cause will take a gentle hint and scram.

                           had a tete-a-tete with a flat-foot in his studio? It seems rather unfair that a peaceful
                           and
                           law-abiding cat can’t sit in a window without being plinked at with an air gun, by
                           an artist
                           with a streak of the buffoon in his makeup. After all, this isn’t Russia, or is it?

                           has made a wise

                           production and
                           photographic departments. It is possible that Holtsizer’s art department will function
                           along
                           the same lines as the Ledger Art Service of some years back. If so he will set a high

                           efficiency for a newspaper art room. Mr. Holtsizer’s new portfolio must give him very

                        <p id="d77246e1704">“All right,” I said “Firstly, as to the word function. You say
                           modern—I say function—let’s call the whole thing off. It is a very apt word,
                           however, but I am sure we could all come to a quicker and better mutual understanding
                           of ideas if we
                           could share them through other means than the cumbersome ambiguity of words. We waste
                           too many years
                           of our life ferreting out definitions rather than principles. But to get back to the
                           house and Lake
                           Dwellers. I do not want you to live like them. But I insist, as I said before, that
                           this home meets
                           the restriction of its environment and present human needs, just as did those homes
                           on stilts, of
                           our ancestors. For that matter this applies to the homes of any period which developed
                           naturally
                           from contemporary living and materials before the decadences when precedent became
                           the vogue
                           regardless of changing needs, equipment, materials and construction.”

                        <p id="d77246e1707">“Well, if this so called Modern is not Modern, but something that has been done through
                           all time, why do the Modernists assume that they have discovered a panacea, an original,
                           supreme,
                           divinely inspired idea. Why are they so cocky?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1710">“If you feel that some assume too much, it might be from natural human weakness. It
                           flatters one’s self-esteem to believe you have discovered a brand new idea. Besides
                           it is
                           good publicity. Once you become news, you do the thing news expects of you or you
                           cease to be news.
                           And as for being cocky, I don’t think they are any cockier than the stylist who hides
                           behind
                           period forms merely because years and a multitude of opinions have made them acceptable.
                           This matter
                           of style or period has been our greatest bugbear. We, as architects, claim it is thrust
                           on us,
                           demanded by our clients. That is true to a degree but I can’t help but feel it is
                           a kind of
                           slothfulness on our part: an easy way out. Clients, after all, are practical human
                           beings and come
                           to an architect as to a physician to be administered to. If we feel strongly enough
                           about an
                           idea—if that idea be sane and logical and fulfill this human need premise, there are
                           few
                           clients who will not give it a hearing.

                           it might
                           serve it’s usefulness in a language, materials, construction and form of the present.

                           many examples
                           that prove the point. Are those gleaming white boxes you apparently defend as beautiful
                           as a Greek

                           order. We like the logical order that is nature’s,—the order that has decreed the
                           form
                           of the aeroplane, the safety razor, the telephone. There has been no precedent for
                           these forms. They
                           are developing naturally and are beautiful. Our building, in which we live and have
                           our being, can
                           and will be so ordered. There has been much done that is immature,—much developed
                           form that
                           seems barren and uninviting. There might be more reasons than I can discuss at the
                           moment for this.
                           There are spacial relationships, color harmonies, economy, prejudice, lack of understanding,
                           bravado
                           and many other forces at work to bring such a result. This may mean little to you
                           but in the
                           confusion I shall be able to get back to this little model and with it I may be able
                           to explain what
                           I mean in this instance at least.”

                           client wanted a home that literally smelt of the sea. In it he wanted to be able to
                           partake of all
                           the pleasures of the sea, sun and air. ‘I must breathe fully at all times’ he told
                           me,
                           ‘I want to live well and play well. I want bathing facilities for myself and friends
                           within
                           easy access to the sea. I want the openness of a sea-going boat. I want a salon with
                           much light and
                           air, staterooms opening onto a wide deck, and a large area for sun bathing. And;’
                           he added
                           ‘knowing the ravages of salt air and water on materials, I want the maintenance low.’
                           And so, you see, that is what he will have—a concrete house with wide unobstructed
                           window
                           openings and spacious areas for freedom and comfortable living. You say it looks like
                           a dumn boat.
                           Yes it does, but maybe as a home it might function adequately for human needs and
                           fit its
                           environment.”

                        <p id="d77246e1729">“Well, since you explain it that way, I admit that it would be a swell place in which
                           to
                           live, and that it does develop a rather pleasing form. But how awful that would look
                           in the
                           suburbs.”

                        <p id="d77246e1732">“Of course. There it would in no way fulfill human needs or that of its environment.
                           One
                           must always design a home, literally, from the ground up. There have been many immature,
                           glaring
                           white boxes built on a softly rolling, mellow green countryside. I call them immature
                           because they
                           have mostly made living harmonious in its perfect adjustment to human needs but have
                           ignored this
                           same harmony with relation to the environment. With our ever-increasing wealth of
                           materials, natural
                           and synthetic, we should build homes that perfectly fulfill all laws of spacial relationship
                           and
                           environmatic color harmony and form.”

                        <p id="d77246e1763">America is fast approaching an age of leisure. The age of faith is past, the age of
                           technocracy
                           has been carefully catalogued and shelved for future reference, and whether we like
                           it or not we
                           shall wake up some fine day to find ourselves in a highly specialized and mechanized
                           age with plenty
                           of time on our hands. The machine has taken possession of our factories and locked
                           labor on the
                           outside. One man and a machine can now do in an hour what many men could only accomplish
                           by days of
                           arduous toil only a few years ago.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1766">A time must come when men can be assured of economic security in return for the work
                           of a few
                           hours a day or of a few months a year. During the long intervals between the periods
                           of gainful
                           employment there will be plenty of free time at the disposal of the individual. This
                           time will be
                           used either for rest or for recreation. Art is concerned with both since it can be
                           the handmaiden of
                           repose as well as of activity. Let us consider the former.

                        <p id="d77246e1770">One of the most fallacious ideas which have been foisted on the modern world is that
                           activity
                           always means progress. We have only to think of the poor captive in the squirrel cage
                           to become
                           aware of the falsity of this statement.

                        <p id="d77246e1773">In the age of leisure which is now upon us much thought will have to be given to providing
                           the
                           setting most advantageous and conducive to rest and reflection. And who is better
                           able and,
                           therefore, more responsible for setting the stage than the artist? It is perfectly
                           true that a lily
                           may grow on a dung heap but thousands upon thousands of far more perfect blooms are
                           nurtured in hot
                           houses or in well cultivated fields. The artist, then, is the true horticulturalist
                           who must not
                           only prepare the soil, but determine the growth of the plant.

                        <p id="d77246e1776">Let us carry our example one step farther. The florist transplants the lily to the
                           environment
                           which he has prepared for it, and in which it will grow best. He does not leave anything
                           to chance,
                           neither does he go into the highways and the hedges to cultivate the plant in its
                           natural setting.
                           In like manner the artist must bring the public to the art which has already been
                           prepared for it.
                           We cannot bring art to the public. The idea of beginning with the public where it
                           is and hanging our
                           art galleries with the picture postcard variety of art in the hope that step by step
                           we may lead the
                           public to appreciate a higher form is just as preposterous as taking our lily bulb
                           and transplanting
                           it every ten days into soil of an increasing degree of richness. Beauty feeds on beauty,
                           and the
                           human soul must be surrounded by loveliness if it is to become lovely itself. The
                           soul which lifts
                           itself by the boot straps from the quagmire to Parnassus is the exception. I repeat,
                           therefore, that
                           it is the artist’s first duty to replace ugliness and confusion with tranquillity
                           so that out
                           of the calm of reflection and retreat may come the foresight and strength for the
                           next advance.

                        <p id="d77246e1779">Let us now consider the part of leisure which will be spent in activity, in recreation.
                           “Satan finds mischief for idle hands to do.” It is as easy to create beauty as to
                           create ugliness. It is as easy to build as to destroy. Often the proper contact with
                           art has remade
                           not only the character of the individual but also of his whole family. The Graphic
                           Sketch Club of
                           Philadelphia is a living testimony to this fact, for here time after time the youth
                           who knows
                           nothing but the unutterably drab and sordid, whose leisure is spent in gangs, in destroying
                           property, and other even more harmful pasttimes suddenly realizes that the same hands
                           which did
                           mischief have in them the power to create beauty.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1782">It is the business of the artist to gather together such as have found in themselves
                           the germ of
                           creative art and to form them into groups where each individual talent may be given
                           a chance under
                           direction to develop, to flower, and to fructify.

                        <p id="d77246e1785">Finally there is need of an organization such as the Cultural Olympics to afford an
                           opportunity
                           and a place where the results of creative efforts can be shared with others, not in
                           a spirit of
                           rivalry or competition but in a spirit of cooperation and sharing; not for prizes
                           but for the joy of
                           the working and the inspiration which comes when the creator shares beautiful experiences
                           with his
                           peers, and when he hears the words “well done” from his superiors. And what a joy
                           is
                           here, when he takes his place among the master craftsmen, even though only an humble
                           disciple and
                           holds forth to the world the thing which his own hands have made—a thing of beauty,
                           a joy

                        <p id="d77246e1882">Isn’t it stimulating that, in this area, there is a school so concerned with the training
                           of its pupils that it subscribes to a plan that will necessitate a dozen or more childrens’
                           absence from “formal” schooling for considerable periods?

                        <p id="d77246e1885">This indicates a realization that creative faculties are better developed through
                           actual
                           participation in practical problems, that conceiving and doing for a purpose are definite
                           and
                           important items to be considered in a pupil’s education.

                        <p id="d77246e1920">For many reasons, we are particularly intrigued by Hendrik Van Loon’s new book,
                           “The Arts” (published by Simon and Shuster). The text is not alone highly informative,
                           but literally sparkles with Van Loon’s typically droll humor. For example, his cynical
                           caption for a picture depicting a prehistoric battle especially amused us. We quote,
                           “The
                           Oldest Picture of Man. The creature is engaged in his customary pastime of killing
                           his
                           fellow-men.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1923">We must admit openly our considerable annoyance occasioned by the author’s swaggering
                           conceit, for his otherwise inclusive history of art is illustrated solely by his own
                           sketches! We
                           are reminded of Whistler’s oft quoted retort to the critic who unbraided him for using
                           a
                           variety of colors in his “Symphony in White”. Whistler fumed in this
                           wise . . . “Is F the only note played in a Symphony in F?
                           F . . . F . . . F . . . Fooll” And so we
                           ask . . . are Van Loon’s pictures alone to be included in a history of art?
                           L . . . L . . . L . . . Loon!

                        <p id="d77246e1926">We cannot urge our readers too strongly to put Thomas Benton’s biography, “An
                           Artist in America,” published by Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., New York, on their
                           “must” list. It is an important document of equal interest to artist and
                           non-artist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77246e1930">Mr. Benton’s picture of growing America pushing Westward has, in this humble
                           reader’s opinion, seldom been rivaled. His experiences and problems, graphically described,
                           present his life, we suspect, with exceeding fidelity.

                        <p id="d77246e1933">The sketchy illustrations, of which there are many, are as valuable to the book as
                           Mr. Van
                           Loon’s illustrations are not valuable to his.

                        <p id="d77246e1936">To paint well a man must have great power of analyzation. In “Artist in America”
                           the artist-author has, through his complete understanding and thorough delineation
                           of his
                           characters, proven the reason for the importance of his art expression.

                           going on in the field which are never reported. Commercial Art seems to be wrapped

                           think it would be interesting to read about new window displays, gas stations, advertising
                           campaigns, store fronts, or broadsides which have merit. These things are part of

                           Perhaps
                           this is because the Philadelphia temperament naturally expresses itself in philanthropy
