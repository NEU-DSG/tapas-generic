                           view that in this prologue I am departing somewhat from my customary
                           modesty.

                        <p id="d77135e210">Some days ago I found myself in a conversation with friends, in which we talked
                           about plays and related matters, and they so dwelt on their finer points as to
                           leave them, it seemed to me, at the peak of perfection.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e213">There was also talk of who was the first in Spain to get plays out of their
                           swaddling clothes, give them airs and graces and dress them up in fine robes. I,
                           the oldest present, said that I remembered having seen the great Lope de Rueda
                           perform, a man of outstanding acting ability and intelligence. He was a native
                           of Sevilla and a goldbeater by trade—in other words he made gold leaf. He was
                           wonderful at pastoral poetry, and in this style no one has ever bettered him,
                           either before or since; and although, because I was a boy then, I could not
                           reliably judge the quality of his verse, when I look back, at the age I am now,
                           at some that I remember, I find what I have said to be true, and, were it not to
                           exceed the purpose of this prologue, I would set some down here that would prove
                           this to be the case.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e216">In the time of that celebrated Spaniard all the equipment of an actor-manager was
                           kept in a sack, amounting, more or less, to four white sheepskins decorated with
                           gilded leather, four beards and wigs, and four crooks. Plays were dialogues,
                           like eclogues, between two or three shepherds and some shepherdess, spiced up
                           and fleshed out by two or three interludes, whether about a black woman, a
                           ruffian, a simpleton or a Basque. The said Lope played all these four figures
                           and many others with the greatest imaginable excellence and mastery. At that
                           time there was no stage machinery, nor duels between Moors and Christians, on
                           foot or on horseback; there was no figure who might emerge, or appear to emerge,
                           from the centre of the earth via the space beneath the stage, which was made up
                           of four benches in the shape of a square and four or six planks placed on top,
                           whereby it was raised up from the floor by the width of four palms. Nor were
                           there any clouds with angels, or souls descended from heaven. The backdrop was
                           an old blanket pulled by two ropes from one side to the other, which made what
                           they call a changing room, behind which were the musicians, singing some old
                           romance without a guitar. Lope de Rueda died, and on account of his being an
                           excellent and famous man they buried him in the main church of Cordoba, where he
                           died, between the two choirs, where that famous madman Luis López is also
                           buried.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e220">Lope de Rueda was succeeded by Navarro, a native of Toledo, who was famous at
                           playing the part of the cowardly ruffian. He brought to a somewhat higher level
                           the stage décor and replaced the sack of costumes with chests and trunks; he
                           brought music, which was previously sung behind the blanket, on to the stage;
                           removed the beards from the actors—until then no one acted without a fake
                           beard—and saw to it that they performed clean-shaven, except those who had to
                           play old men, or other characters who might require a change of face. He
                           introduced stage machinery, special effects involving clouds, thunder and
                           lightening, duels and battles, but he did not bring these to their present
                           sublime level.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e223">And it is incontrovertibly true, and here I have to be a little outspoken, that

                           <title id="d77135e231">The Naval Battle</title>, where I
                           dared to reduce plays from five acts to three, were seen performed in the
                           theatres of Madrid; that I revealed, or rather was the first to present on
                           stage, the workings of the imagination or hidden thoughts of the soul, by
                           bringing allegorical figures to the theatre, to the general and appreciative
                           applause of the audience; and that I composed at that time up to twenty or
                           thirty plays, all of which were performed without cucumbers or other missiles
                           being thrown, and ran their course without whistles, cries or uproar.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e235">I had other things with which to occupy myself and gave up the pen and
                           playwriting, and then that monster of nature, the great Lope de Vega, entered,
                           usurped the theatrical throne, subjugated and placed under his control all the
                           actors, and filled the world with his own successful and well-plotted plays, of
                           which he has written so many that they fill more than ten thousand sheets of
                           paper, and all of which he has seen performed, or at least heard of their having
                           been performed, which is one of the most important things that can be said; and
                           even though some, and there are many, have wished to rival him in his output and
                           share some of his glory, what all of them put together have written does not
                           amount to half of what he alone has managed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e238">However, since God does not grant everything to one man alone, one should not,
                           despite all that has just been said, underestimate the works of Dr Ramón, who
                           was the most prolific after the great Lope; the highly ingenious plots of the
                           licenciate Miguel Sánchez, the gravity of Dr Mira de Mescua, who honours our
                           nation in his own unique way; the intelligence and endless inventiveness of
                           Canon Tárraga; the sweet, flowing verse of don Guillén de Castro; the
                           incisiveness of Aguilar; the lavishness, rumbustuousness, pomp and grandeur of
                           the plays of Luis Veléz de Guevara; the plays currently in preparation by the
                           quick-witted don Antonio de Galarza, and what is promised by Gaspar de Ávila’s
                           
                           <title id="d77135e240">The Tricks of Love</title>. All these and others have helped to bear
                           the weight of the great machine that Lope has created.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d77135e244">A few years ago I returned to my former vice and, thinking that the period in
                           which my praises were sung still endured, wrote some more plays; but I did not
                           find any birds in the nests of yesteryear, in other words I did not find an
                           actor-manager who wanted them, even though they knew I had them; and so I threw
                           them into a chest, consigning and condemning them to perpetual silence. At the
                           time a bookseller informed me that he would have bought them, had a
                           actor-manager of some note not told him that much could be expected of my prose,
                           but of my verse nothing. If truth be told, it certainly upset me to hear that
                           and I said to myself: <q style=" display: inline; ">Either I have changed or times have improved, which is
                              the reverse of what usually happens, since the past is always praised.</q> I
                           looked over my plays again, and over some interludes of mine that had been
                           thrown into a corner with them. and found them to be not so bad that they did
                           not deserve to emerge from the darkness of the opinion of that actor-manager
                           into the light of that of other less cautious and better informed ones. I grew
                           tired of the situation and sold them to the aforementioned bookseller, who
                           printed them as you find them offered here. He paid me reasonably for them; I
                           took my money with equanimity, without having to argue with actors. I would that
                           they were the best in the world, or at least not bad: you will be the judge,
                           dear reader, and should you find them to have some good points, then, when you
                           bump into that slanderous actor-manager, tell him to mend his ways, since I
                           offend no one, and to note that my plays don’t contain patent and obvious
                           silliness; that the verse meets the demands of drama, which requires the lowest
                           of the three styles; that the the language of the interludes is appropriate to
                           the characters they introduce; and that, as a peace-offering, I will present him
                           with a play that I am writing, entitled

                           are not so lacking in flavour that they cannot provide some pleasure. If they
                           have any virtue it is that they have neither been pawed over nor performed,
                           thanks to the actors, who, being of the utmost intelligence, only concern
                           themselves with great works and important authors, although perhaps they are

                           feet. He will arrive complaining, because in Tarragona they hounded and
                           mistreated him, although, in any case, he bears information that it is not he
                           who is the subject of that story, but an imposter, who tried to impersonate him
                           but did succeed. Then the great
