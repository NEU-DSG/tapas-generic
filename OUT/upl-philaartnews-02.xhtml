                        <p id="d1177e215">Behold, Philadelphia painters, the power of publicity. Behold the international success
                           of the Parisian artists, living and dead, whose work has been promoted commercially
                           by the smoothest-working publicity machine in the history of art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e218">Who chose these painters as leaders—as being great? Obviously, the dealers. Not the
                           people. Not even the critics. And how beautifully the dealers co-operated to enhance
                           the values of unwanted, disliked paintings by unknown, unsuccessful artists! The dealers
                           bought their stock of pictures for insignificant sums, making their heaviest investment
                           in Publicity. No opportunity did they lose to stir controversy over their daubs, good
                           or bad. Stories appeared frequently in the press. Books were published. A flood of
                           talk floated values from a few cents to tens of thousands of dollars.

                           or meaning or skill that sells art.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d1177e228">Why don’t you co-operate? Why don’t you pool your news, exchange compliments or controversy
                           with one another to make People talk, so that your work and your stock will advance
                           bravely under the standard of the Almighty Dollar?

                           France, French dealers, and American dealers who import French Art, have done through
                           a consistent use of their official and unofficial channels of Publicity. These have
                           been well rewarded, for Art has become an important source of national income for
                           France, and of profit to the dealers handling her Art. Her artists are revered all
                           over the world. Students of Art in other lands spend their lives trying to capture
                           the mysterious isms which have succeeded so nobly—with such glittering financial rewards.

                        <p id="d1177e234">Cezanne was an excellent man. His sincere attempts at self-expression have enchanted
                           us all. We’ve been stimulated with the Cezanne ideology which has been dinned into
                           us with dizzying publicity. His work has been well sold. How could the Pennsylvania
                           Museum resist buying one of his paintings for the bargain price of only a hundred
                           and ten thousand dollars?

                           hundred and ten thousand dollars slipped through your flabby fingers! But don’t groan;
                           Whose fault is it?

                           faith which has made the French School the most conspicuous in the world. Here is

                        <p id="d1177e244">The Philadelphia Record and the New York Evening Post have devoted two-page spreads
                           to the advertisement of Van Gogh prints which they are giving away for a number of
                           coupons to be clipped from their papers. We ad-writers who wrote the blurbs for this
                           spread went to town in a big way. It sorta brought tears to our eyes, but Peyton Boswell,
                           editor of the Art Digest, had a different reaction. He comments:

                        <p id="d1177e308">The “expert” testimony offered in today’s newspapers in favor of the Museum’s Cezanne
                           “Bathers,” and the setting which is supposed to invest the statement with authority,
                           will bear a little looking into.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e311">The blanket designation of “Metropolitan Museum of Art” as one of the “experts,” with
                           no official’s name attached, is about on a par as valid testimony with that of the
                           Pennsylvania Railroad Station.

                        <p id="d1177e314">The supposedly authoritative book from which a quotation is offered, is in reality
                           a photograph album published by a Paris picture dealer of whom the Museum buys paintings.
                           The essential point in this testimony involves a delicate matter, and I have promised
                           the Museum officials not to let the cat out of the bag at the present.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e317">The third “expert” named, Mr. Carrol S. Tyson, is, by way of qualification, said to
                           be an “artist and collector” and “in recognition of his own art he was honored by
                           the French Government last August with the Chevalier Cross of the Legion of Honor.”
                           The facts about the latter quotation are that the French Government never saw Tyson’s
                           “art,” and the decoration was awarded to him because of his loans of French pictures
                           to exhibitions sponsored by the French Government. The so-called “honor” is in fact
                           just a plain matter of payment made for material services rendered.

                        <p id="d1177e320">It will be news to the well-informed in art matters to learn that Mr. Tyson is an
                           “artist;” heretofore he has been known chiefly as a rich Philadelphia socialite who,
                           for the past twenty-five years, has been trying to paint passable imitations of French
                           impressionist pictures, but has never quite succeeded. There is a vast difference
                           between that sort of activity and what constitutes either artistic creation or competence
                           in esthetic judgment.

                        <p id="d1177e324">What all of this supposedly “expert” testimony amounts to is a series of mere assertions
                           unsupported by the presentation of any relevant or verifiable facts. My statement
                           concerning the Museum’s “Bathers” named the objective features that marked the painting
                           as of about “fifth-rate quality,” it cited the figures indicating the extent to which
                           the city has been “stung,” and it asserted that “an official spokesman for the City
                           of Philadelphia, in municipal art matters has given to the public press of America,
                           false and misleading information in which the unwarranted exploitation of my name
                           has led people to believe that I endorse the misrepresentation.”

                        <p id="d1177e327">The only reply satisfactory to the public will consist of equally specific statements
                           upon each of my accusations, and made by an official of the City or the Museum. Up
                           to the present, the public has had nothing but vague ipse dixits from irresponsible
                           and incompetents.

                           non-existent sum of money, a series of large, full color reproductions of the work

                        <p id="d1177e372">The other day one of our acquaintances took us to task for our enthusiasm on the subject.
                           Why, he wondered, do they not place a premium on American art, rather than on past
                           foreign accomplishments?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e375">Why not? It’s certainly a good idea—if practicable. Unfortunately it is not at all
                           practicable. America has not yet come sufficiently of age to warrant her buying, popularly,
                           even in reproductions, the worst or best in American art. But she’s grown up enough
                           to begin buying good art—providing it appeals to her romantically, if not aesthetically.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e378">For example, Mr. X may be dragged to a symphony concert, have a very dull time listening
                           to Beethoven, and come home glad it’s over. If, perchance, the following day he begins
                           to read a romantic novel based upon the life and loves of Ludwig, he shall unwittingly
                           have established a point of contact with the composer, and the next time he listens
                           to Beethoven it will be with infinitely more interest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e381">The same element, we feel, is largely responsible for the sudden and amazing popularity
                           of Van Gogh in America today. The fact that he amputated one of his ears and sent
                           it affectionately to his favorite harlot has little in common with his greatness as
                           a painter—but it furnishes a magnificent side entrance for the layman. He knows now
                           that Vincent was quite as crazy as some of us, in our own intelligent ways, that he
                           was quite as human—that he was, and is, brother Vincent, not only to Theo but to all
                           of us. And America takes Vincent to its heart, not because of the ear, but because
                           of the humanity. By the same token, many people would love Brahms more than they do,
                           if they knew he had false teeth.

                        <p id="d1177e384">So let’s not quibble about whether Vincent was or was not American, but rejoice in
                           the fact that work of Vincent’s calibre can actually be sold popularly in America.
                           One of these days in the natural process of things, one of our countrymen shall have
                           the same distinction.

                        <p id="d1177e388">Vigor and variety are the two outstanding characteristics of the Print Club’s Fifth
                           National Exhibition of prints. It is interesting to compare the French group with
                           the Polish, for here we have the greatest possible technical and emotional contrast.

                        <p id="d1177e391">The French, as ever, remain apostles of linear and tonal delicacy, as witness the
                           output of such contributors as Picasso, Segonzac and Jean-Morin. Considerable substance
                           of tone is to be found in the work of Germaine de Coster and Jean Bersier to say nothing
                           of the extravagantly varied texture of Fried Berger’s etching and drypoint “Du Cote
                           de Chez Moi.”

                        <p id="d1177e394">In the work of the Poles we have strength, sharpness and violent contrast of rhythms.
                           Pawel Steller in his “Housewife of Silesian Mountains” and “Beehive-Keeper from Wolyn,”
                           both wood-cuts, has gone to the old German masters for his intricacy of detail. Charles
                           Winzer’s lithographs “Zeus and the Nymphs” and “Death of a Unicorn” hark likewise
                           to another, but different, age. Delicate and poetic, they are not unlike Fantin-Latour.

                        <p id="d1177e397">A definite kinship exists between the Polish and Hungarian prints, although the latter
                           lean rather more toward the naturalistic—without, however, sacrificing rhythmic considerations.

                        <p id="d1177e400">It seems quite unnecessary to comment upon the type of prints hailing from England
                           and Scotland; all print lovers are familiar with their unchanging print tradition.
                           Robert Austin, S. R. Badmin, Arthur Briscoe, Dame Laura Knight, James McBey and Sir
                           D. Y. Cameron should furnish a fair idea of the contributors.

                        <p id="d1177e403">The German section is extremely well chosen and represents some of the most progressive
                           of contemporary German artists. George Grosz, Kaethe Kollwitz, Carl Hofer, Renee Sintenis
                           and Emil Nolde are but a few of the printmakers who have contributed to the success
                           of this section.

                        <p id="d1177e407">From Japan come the usual landscapes, figure studies and exquisite fish, and the Mexican
                           group is as startling as Charlot, Orozco and Rivera can make it.

                        <p id="d1177e410">The American group is, all things considered, rather feeble. The catalogue explains
                           that “it has been thought best to invite only a few American artists to enter this
                           exhibition” because of lack of space and the fact that American printmakers are so
                           well represented in other shows throughout the year.

                           of the items have been, or are being shown elsewhere in the city. Robert Riggs, Benton
                           Spruance and Earle Miller pep up the United States section considerably.

                           of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, now current at the Art Club, is painfully
                           near being the dullest show we’ve ever seen. However, the few sprightly items that
                           did get in probably profit by contrast.

                        <p id="d1177e422">Wade Jolly, for instance, contributes the most brilliant group in the show—a series
                           of Bermuda studies, while Ben Solowey, with the vital diamond composition of his “Tulips”,
                           has created the most distinctive single picture. Katherine Farrell’s “Belfrey Tower—Taos,
                           New Mexico” has achieved harmonious color and charming geometric simplicity, and June
                           Groff realizes considerably more than distinctive individuality.

                        <p id="d1177e426">“Man Catching Bait”, by Virginia Armitage McCall, is beautiful in its opalescent suggestion
                           of mountains, trees and sky. The “man” in question is infinitesimal, the general conception
                           remarkably fine. Will Coffee’s “Owl of the Desert” might have been better; it seems
                           to have missed fire, whereas the paintings of Paul Gill and Paul Laessle have inordinate
                           freshness and spontaneity.

                        <p id="d1177e429">William N. Goodell shows “Jimmy Reading”, and Jimmy is as vital in art as he probably
                           is in life. Anton Albers, Janet Ball, Mary Butler, Henrietta Henning, Mary Mullineux,
                           Frederick Nunn, Wuanita Smith, Martha Walter, Jean Flannigan, June Groff, Fred Wagner
                           and Gladys M. G. West round out the list of distinctive contributors.

                        <p id="d1177e432">One would not be inclined to suspect that T. Mitchell Hastings was formerly an architect,
                           or that he had begun to paint scarcely more than a year ago. One’s first impression
                           of his showing of water colors now at the Warwick Galleries is cleanliness of pigmentation
                           and decorative quality.

                        <p id="d1177e435">There are but few of these pictures that aspire to violent contrast or tonal depth;
                           for the most part they reveal a soft serenity of vision. While such paintings as “Laon
                           Cathedral, France” and “Twilight; Ojai Valley, California” have deepened themselves
                           tonally—the former suggestive of Jules Guerin, the latter quite Japanesque—we search
                           in vain for pigmental “mud”. The shadows have a nice iridescence.

                        <p id="d1177e438">In “Road to Glory: Pioche, Nevada” and Pacific Sunrise; near Hawaii the difficult
                           subject of sun and clouds is presented without too much sentimentality, and for the
                           more homely subject handled intimately we recommend the studies of “Dairy Ranch” and
                           “Shacks” which the painter observed in Santa Barabara, California.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e441">Extraordinarily fresh in color is “Red Head Frame; Pioche, Nevada”, in which red wood
                           rears itself against blue mountains. “Mission; Ojai Valley; California” and “Greek
                           Monastary; Island of Skyros” are seen through a poet’s eyes.

                        <p id="d1177e445">Charles Burchfield is not interested in frills, as may readily be seen at his exhibition
                           of large water colors at the Art Alliance. He looks at America and envisions a drab
                           world—one that certainly offers little to the lover of gaiety—but one that is honestly
                           seen and forcefully expressed. His pigmental language is broad and simple, and its
                           simplicity is eloquent.

                        <p id="d1177e448">As usual, the high priests of Mexican art—Rivera, Charlot and Orozco—cover most of
                           the territory in the adjoining room devoted to the prints of their country. It is
                           not a large show, but its impact, after Burchfield, is tremendous.

                           to be seen at the Philadelphia A. C. A. Gallery. Not only have they absorbed the Western
                           aesthetic outlook, but three of them have turned avidly to the inevitable social problem.

                        <p id="d1177e460">Yun Gee’s two studies are brilliantly patterned, Isami Doi sees Hawaii as a turbulent
                           spot, and Chuzo Tomotsu shows a “Summer Arbor”, naive and reminiscent of Rousseau—also
                           a “Washday” more than suggestive of Kuniyoshi, Thomas Nagai contributes two landscapes—the
                           most Oriental works in the show. There is also an unusual wood carving—female torso—by
                           an unknown contemporary Chinese sculptor.

                        <p id="d1177e464">The present group of water colors at the Boyer Galleries is spiced highly enough to
                           tickle the most jaded tongue. All of the contributors are inclined, in one way or
                           another, to be witty—whether it be line, mass or color.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e467">David Burliuk, whose naivete is as boundless as his philosophy is profound, shows
                           two small water colors—“Still Life—Fish” and “Russian Peasants”—both vivid joys to
                           the eye and accomplished with zest. Carl Shaffer, in “Bittersweet,” manifests his
                           usual affection for black outlines, and, with Shaffer, they are always effective.
                           Here they flow along beautifully with the painter’s not too dry, not too juicy, reds
                           and browns. “Unmasked,” on the other hand, is a sufficiently fluid water color to
                           remind one of the flood, and is quite as piquant as the Shaffer of the flesh. A violently
                           red mask is lowered to reveal only the lady’s eyes—and evil ones they are.

                           richly subdued color. One senses not only the stench of the fish, but the divinity
                           of the dune. Viktor Planckh, in “Potato Harvest,” furnishes the show’s classicism,
                           and Rainey Bennett goes to the “Seashore” in a big way, and a provocative one. Herman

                           His erstwhile indulgence in lithography has left its mark upon his present etchings—a
                           multitude of lines, much tonal depth and breadth.

                           clever enough to alter his general plastic feeling to suit the occasion. There is
                           more simplicity of design in these. “Mexican Mother”, indeed, stems quite patently
                           from Charlot.

                        <p id="d1177e512">Wayne Martin, instructor in the fine arts at Radnor Township High School, spoke to
                           a group at the Art Alliance, 
                           <date id="d1177e514" when="--11-11">November 11</date>, on Ceramics, describing some experiments he and his wife, daughter of the well-known
                           potter, E. deF. Curtis, had made in this craft.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e518">Informally sketching his own introduction into the field of pottery-making, he summarized
                           his experiences by saying that ceramics “challenges like no other craft, and you soon
                           learn to worship the god of fires, and can understand the Chinese potters of old who
                           sacrificed their own children’s blood for the sake of color.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e521">Mr. Martin gave a brief history of ceramics, as well as an account of his work with
                           child instruction, concluding by characterizing ceramics as possessing the three qualities
                           that “brand any object as a work of art: something whose materials have been carefully
                           selected, something that has been skillfully manipulated, and finally something that
                           has been purposefully adapted to human need.”

                        <p id="d1177e817">Even composers do not know what will be the reaction of their audience to their music.
                           Tchaikowsky said that he himself had no concrete explanation of the emotion which
                           moved him in composing. When asked concerning symphonic work he replied . . .
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e820">“How can one express those vague feelings which pass through one during the writing
                           of an instrumental work which in itself has no definite subject? It is a purely lyrical
                           process, a musical confession of the soul that, filled with the experiences of a lifetime,
                           pours itself out through sound, just as the lyric poet pours himself out in verse.”

                        <p id="d1177e823">Many interesting abstract pictures can be achieved through the versatile medium of
                           the camera. The subject is not nearly as important as the approach. Let’s try to attain
                           a symphonic tonality, thought in sequence, free rein to pattern and a pleasing play
                           to imagination.

                        <p id="d1177e835">Philadelphia’s foremost housing experiment is represented by the Carl Mackley Houses,
                           Bristol, between “M” and “N” Streets. Here the modern conception of art for useful
                           as well as for aesthetic enjoyment is fulfilled in a vital and stimulating manner.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e838">Built in several units about open courts, the houses contain two hundred and eighty-four
                           low-priced apartments of two, four and five rooms. The exterior of the buildings is
                           finished in a light yellow glazed brick, with doors and various parts of the trim
                           accented in bright blue. The general impression is of great solidity and yet lightness,
                           due no doubt to the unusual size and number of windows. The interiors of the apartments
                           are remarkable for their efficiency and for the large amount of sunshine and air.
                           Each apartment has a balcony or other open-air living space, these doing much to relieve
                           any monotony inherent in such a formal design.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e841">Besides the general practicality of the apartments themselves, this project has other
                           features unusual to the average apartment house. There is a swimming pool in the center
                           court as well as a wading pool for younger children, an auditorium, and specially
                           designed laundries on the roofs.

                        <p id="d1177e844">The Carl Mackley Houses were erected by the American Federation of Hosiery Workers,
                           whose members are given preference in rentals, with the co-operation of the Federal
                           Government. The architects were Alfred Kastner and Oscar Stonorov.

                        <p id="d1177e893">Dr. Lin Yutang, celebrated Chinese author of “My Country and My People” delivered
                           the second lecture in the series “Vital Issues in Art,” 
                           <date id="d1177e895" when="--11-06">November 6</date>, at the Parkway Museum. The subject of his speech was the “Contribution of the East
                           to the West.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e899">Moderation and eloquence distinguished this address, and address that commended itself
                           to the thoughtful attention of a large audience. In Dr. Yutang’s opinion the East
                           can add nothing to the material, scientific, or economic pretentions of the West;
                           but it is possible that something can be contributed to our concept of art—especially
                           in the way of a more lyric and animal sensitivity to beauty, rhythm, and line. This
                           contribution might counterbalance the ponderous precision and inflexibility of the
                           Western mind. Dr. Yutang said that to the Chinese a circle is still a straight line,
                           if we would understand.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e902">Two separated tendencies in art and life were clearly defined—one toward intellectual
                           logic and material greatness, the other toward artistic perception and mental elevation.
                           One is struck by the graceful ease with which the Chinese mind embraces this duality,
                           and how it gladly acknowledges art to be the way back to unity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e905">Dr. Yutang emphasized the aesthetics of line, remarking, the immensity of suggestion
                           achieved through the Chinese development of line as an independent potential of expression,
                           until there is a lyrical indication in the actual brushstroke.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e909">The West has much to learn from such representatives of Eastern art—as Dr. Yutang—who
                           contribute much if they deepen our appreciation of the eccentric loveliness and the
                           greatness of Chinese art.

                        <p id="d1177e941">Such is the run of conversations pertaining to the more than one hundred oil paintings
                           owned by the University of Pennsylvania. A general vagueness permeates both staff
                           and students whenever the subject is mentioned. Nobody knows about them and nobody
                           seems to care.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e944">The collection, as listed in the one catalogue available, consists of one hundred
                           and sixty-nine portraits of University men, done, for the most part, by American painters
                           of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They are scattered throughout various
                           University buildings, such as the Medical Laboratories, Houston Hall, the Main Library.
                           Too many, however, are hidden in darkness and dirt. There seems to be no central authority
                           responsible for the condition of these pictures, hence a great number of the older
                           paintings, for instance the rather charming but unknown portrait of Oliver Wolcott,
                           Jr., are hidden by dirt and varnish. Many are hung so high that only a circus giant
                           could look at them comfortably. Many are hung in a darkness that seems to symbolize
                           the general obscurity to which their subjects have been relegated, as the indiscernible
                           portrait in the vestibule of the library. Many unfortunately lack the name of the
                           subject; many more, even more unfortunately, lack the names of either artist or subject.
                           One of the latter group comes particularly to mind, the portrait of a benevolent gentleman
                           that hangs directly over the main desk in the library. Again, the comparatively new
                           portrait of Dr. Rosengarten, also in the main library, is hung without the name of
                           the artist. Still another instance of this neglect is a small landscape of the nineteenth
                           century romantic type hanging above the entrance to the American History Seminar,
                           for which no title, author, or school is given.

                        <p id="d1177e947">Undoubtedly there is a very definite need for a general reorganization of the collection,
                           with special emphasis placed on the need for a new catalogue. Mr. Nitzche’s is an
                           aid, but it is far from complete, due to the acquisition of new pictures since its
                           compilation, and now, over twenty years after its publication, it contains inaccuracies.
                           Many of the pictures listed as being in certain places have been removed to new, known
                           or unknown, destinations. Such is the case with the Gainsborough Benjamin Franklin.
                           Formerly in the University library, it is now in President Gates’ office. More mysterious
                           is the fate of two Eakins portraits. The catalogue states that they are in the University
                           Museum, but a careful search of the building and a persistent questioning of three
                           members of the staff failed to disclose their whereabouts. Certainly a thorough cataloguing
                           of these paintings, giving their history and their location would be a worthy publication.
                           Could a portion of the Bicentennial Fund be appropriated for this project?

                        <p id="d1177e950">Taken individually, the majority of these paintings are probably not particularly
                           valuable, but as a collection they do have a definite worth. They illustrate, in a
                           thorough manner, nineteenth and early twentieth century portraiture, in its conventionality,
                           placidity, occasional brilliance, and as such have a historical, if not purely aesthetic
                           value. Here are four paintings by the Philadelphia artist, John Neagle, the Sargent
                           portrait of J. William White, six examples of Sully’s work, Charles Wilson Peale’s
                           portrait of David Rittenhouse, several works by Thomas Eakins, including the famous
                           Agnew Clinic, which might well be a companion piece to the Gross Clinic in the possession
                           of the Jefferson Medical College. There are also a few examples by foreign painters,
                           the Gainsborough mentioned above, the DeLloip Benjamin Franklin, and Angelica Kauffman’s
                           portrait of John Morgan.

                           Intellectual and independent tendencies shaping the destiny of the artist are developing
                           a personality more sensitively attuned to, and more conscious of, the complexities
                           of life. Within the measure of such a development, the artist, too, and more keenly
                           than the layman, must feel the pulse of his time. His sphere of action, his ties—social,
                           cultural, and material—evolve in him a desire for inquiry, a revaluation of the concepts
                           of art in the search for readjustments. The artist, by leaps and bounds, is capable
                           of visioning horizons deep into the past ages, wide into the present, and high into
                           the future.

                        <p id="d1177e975">If contemporary creative efforts need scrutiny, analysis, and understanding; sculpture,
                           as an art of expression, requires them perhaps more so. It is not uncommon to note
                           that the very concept of sculpture as an art is often lost—either not consummated
                           or not assimilated. Sculpture, the oldest of the fine arts, expresses—more profoundly—truth,
                           simplicity, and beauty. The universality of the art of sculpture, as exemplified by
                           great works of past civilizations, touches the very heart of human emotions.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e978">What is sculpture today? To the layman, the words “sculpture” and “sculptor” sound
                           strange, forlorn, as if, vaguely enveloped in antiquity. A host of misinterpretations
                           surrounds the meaning of sculpture. Is wood-carving sculpture? Is stone-cutting sculpture?
                           Or metal chasing? Or molding? These synonyms of sculpture are crafts: they can be
                           poor or good in their own right, excel as crafts if touched by a creative impulse.
                           In relation to sculpture, these fine crafts are tools and technical means of expression.
                           Sculptural decorations, three-dimensional accessories, embellishments within voluminous
                           spaces, ornamental frivolities, are only step-cousins in the realm of the great traditions
                           of sculpture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e982">A common denominator of prevailing trends and styles in sculpture is to translate
                           an idea into plastic forms, organized and rhythmic. Mystical archaism, as a style
                           draws some artists into a world of allegorical transcendencies, colorful fabulæ, and
                           fantastic folk-lore. Neo-classicism draws inspiration from the great sources of the
                           golden ages of sculpture, of tranquil simplicity, arrested motion, and Hellenic beauty.
                           Impressionism in the realm of plastic art ascends to the highest expression of psychological
                           emotions, vibrating form within form. The dominant tendency of contemporary art is
                           realism: social, dramatic, and humane. Ideological, emotional motivation, inventiveness,
                           technical equipment, and, above all, intellectual grasp, are part and parcel of sculptural
                           expression today. A requisite of creative sculpture is knowledge of the intricacies
                           of its own media, also, knowledge of, and experience in, the allied arts: graphic,
                           painting, and architecture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e985">Such an artist dwells not in veiled abstraction, nor subjects himself to immunization
                           from reality. He faces life courageously, feels the turmoil of his surroundings and
                           gives expression—from life, to life.

                           sculptors with an opportunity to do experimental work under ideal conditions from
                           January to May. The artists provide their own materials, but are given board and lodging.

                           to know how to help such people, to bring out their best and to straighten out their
                           difficulties. Yet he never influences their work toward his own abstract expression.

                           detail which has been blanketed by soot for two generations. We question the esthetic
                           merit of this expensive laundering of the great landmark. Before Mayor Wilson had
                           its face washed, City Hall was an even more magnificent conglomeration of ugliness
                           than it is now.

                        <p id="d1177e1173">“William Penn, Proprietor,” took his place on top of our incredible geologic agglomeration
                           of civic investiture in 1894. He is thirty-seven feet tall and weighed 53,523 pounds
                           when he was put up, being cast in bronze. He probably weighs a little more now because
                           some of his sections were bolted more firmly a few years ago, when it was feared he
                           might lay his hand on some passing pedestrian five hundred and forty-eight feet below.

                        <p id="d1177e1176">His benign figure was modelled by Alexander Milne Calder, a Scot by birth, who was
                           engaged by the Architect, John McArthur. The statue of Penn crowned an amazing fecundity,
                           for Calder did the myriad balance of the City Hall sculpture. Behold it!

                           in Philadelphia. A grandson, also an Alexander Calder, is noted for his Mobiles or
                           Harmonic Motion designs which he has exhibited in 1934 and 1937 at the Pierre Matisse

                        <p id="d1177e1214">The passing of Hugh H. Breckenridge makes a gap in the thin line of really great art-teachers
                           in America, in addition to leaving a keen sense of personal loss in the hearts of
                           the hundreds of students, artists, and laymen, who felt the influence of his brilliant
                           personality or appreciated his work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1217">He taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for forty-three years, instructing,
                           at one time or another, in almost every branch of the Graphic Arts. With Auschutz,
                           he conducted the Darby School of Painting, first at Darby and later continued at Fort
                           Washington. Then he taught at the Chester Springs Summer School, a subsidiary of the
                           Academy, until he organized his own school at Rocky Neck, Gloucester, Massachusetts.
                           Those who were fortunate enough to study with him at his Rocky Neck studio learned
                           to know him best. It was at this school that his progressive ideas came into full
                           play. His Saturday Morning Reviews were exciting revelations of his keen mind. His
                           pupils were stimulated by the intelligent display and discussion of their astonishingly
                           varied work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1220">Except in the cases of a few unimportant, superficial painters who picked up this
                           or that “trick” from him, the “Breckenridge Influence,” as a flip judgment of a school
                           of painting, is a myth. Brecky was skilled in the art of encouraging the individual
                           growth of his students, who attained the stature of artists in their own right. This
                           was his true Influence, and it will make its impress on American Art for a long time
                           to come.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1224">The quantity and quality of Breckenridge’s painting and the long list of his prizes
                           and honors in the art world are amazing when one considers the extent of his important
                           teaching activities. His restless and ingenious mind made him an inveterate experimenter.
                           Each painting he produced was an idiomatic adventure in self-expression. It has been
                           said that his work underwent “periods,” but it is more nearly true of him that he
                           was a linguist in paint, constantly exploring new languages of color and technique.
                           He was equipped with an alert mind and enormous technical skill in draughtsmanship
                           and knowledge of color. His experiments led him more and more into abstractions which
                           were purely individual expressions, unflavored by the fashionable French influence
                           of Matisse, Picasso, Bracque, et al. His work was his own.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1227">In 1934, the Academy tendered him a Retrospective Exhibition which disclosed him as
                           a profound scholar of esthetics. It is a bright spot on the gray field of Philadelphia’s
                           artistic lethargy, that this honor was accorded to Breckenridge while he was alive.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1230">With keen regret for his passing, the Philadelphia Art News encloses a reproduction
                           of Hugh Breckenridge’s “Still Life,” through the courtesy of the Locust Club where
                           it now hangs. This painting won the Locust Club Award in 1927.

                        <p id="d1177e1258">A Tower of Chimes in Whitemarsh Memorial Park, Whitemarsh Valley is being designed
                           by Paul P. Cret. No definite style of architecture has been followed, unless it be
                           called “Paul P. Cret” style, but an attempt has been made to capture the religious
                           quality of the Romanesque period, when an intense belief in life after death was evident.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1261">In the Tower there is a Wishing Seat like the one in Sir James Barrie’s “The Little
                           Minister”. The stone for this was quarried in the very place where the Minister met
                           and courted his gypsy, Kurriemuir, Scotland. The ends of the seat incorporate stones
                           from the paving of St. Peter’s in Rome, and from the cathedral in Panama City which
                           was once sacked by Sir Henry Morgan, the pirate. In front of the seat is an actual
                           meteorite upon which lovers may kneel to plight their troth in the traditional manner.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1264">It is indeed heart-warming to find an architect who uses actual materials having a
                           definite association with the past periods he is re-creating. While contrary to the
                           tenets of modernity, sentiment is certainly permissible in the atmosphere of a memorial
                           park.

                        <p id="d1177e1267">Jean DeMarco, of New York City, has done the sculpture for the Tower. Where were you,
                           Philadelphia sculptors, when Mr. Cret was scouting for someone to do this work?

                           as it has marked the occasion each year since the club was formed at the turn of the
                           century. Open house will be held, with an informal gathering, at which there will
                           be vocal and instrumental selections from the music department and presentation of
                           gifts of painting and sculpture executed by students. Mr. Fleisher, winner of the
                           Bok Award in 1924, will reply to the tribute.

                           high school students preparing to go on to art school, middle-aged persons who come
                           for sanctuary from home and office problems, older people who just “like to draw.”

                           details, such as posing models or arranging for adequate lighting. A few of the former
                           students who have since become famous include Leopold Seiffert, whose portrait of
                           Mr. Fleisher hangs behind the desk in the school office, Francis Chris, recipient
                           of a Guggenheim Foundation traveling scholarship, and Lazar Raditz, well-known portrait

                           On an eminence overlooking a broad, albeit bumpy, driveway I observed a most impressive
                           winged building, done in roseate marbles. Its fluted columns stood above a multitude
                           of broad granite steps which were guarded by two muscular, mythical monsters in gold-leafed
                           bronze.

                        <p id="d1177e1373">“That,” said he, “is the Temple of Art. It took ten years to build and cost twenty-one
                           million dollars. The foundations alone required the entire original appropriation.
                           Its corridors and bronze doors are the finest in the world. They occupy more than
                           one-third of its floor space.”

                           entered a room which was puny in comparison with the corridor. Several very large
                           windows illuminated this small room. Pictures were hung between the windows and on
                           the other walls. I could not see those at one end because people were entering the
                           room and fanning out from the door. Pictures on the wall opposite the windows mirrored
                           the sky. Their content was lost. I stood this way and that, trying to see them. No
                           use. I tried to see those hanging between the windows, but the halation of light was
                           too strong for my eyes to penetrate.

                        <p id="d1177e1540">Paintings on glass by Herbert C. Beagary have been placed on view at Catherine Field
                           Comly’s, 1805 Walnut Street, to be on exhibit for a week or ten days.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1543">Painting on glass is at once one of the oldest and one of the rarest forms of painting.
                           The Chinese in the eighteenth century did practically the finest work in this medium
                           that has ever been done. At the same time in the United States and in America they
                           were using glass painting for clock ornaments.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1546">Mr. Beagary has tried various types of paint, and he is still experimenting. Chemists
                           invariably say that painting on glass is an impossibility—that, glass being non-absorbent,
                           there can be no cohesive quality. But Mr. Beagary has proved that it can be done.
                           At present he is working with opaque water color, but expects to use oils later.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1549">Mr. Beagary is especially interested in the decorative side of art, believing that
                           in decoration the modern artist will find one of his most fertile fields.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1553">An exhibition of rare rugs and antique tapestries of Michaelyan, of New York and Palm
                           Beach, was on display in the ballroom of the Warwick Hotel from 
                           <date id="d1177e1555" when="--11-15">November 15</date> to 19, under the auspices of Mr. George Lamaze, vice-president of that hotel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1559">Special feature of the exhibition was the replica of the widely-known Holy Ardebil
                           Carpet of the Victoria and Albert Museum, in London, measuring 34 feet long by 17
                           feet wide.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1562">One of the new notes in interior decoration is the increased use of mirrors. Frequently
                           they are used to cover the whole side of a room. Again, especially in narrow halls,
                           they are employed to give an illusion of width.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1565">The present trend in interior decoration is mostly late eighteenth century English
                           and American with new notes injected, giving a fresh and up-to-date ensemble. There
                           is, however, an apparent return of the earlier periods perhaps because of the many
                           early English homes recently built.

                        <p id="d1177e1574">A stained glass window by John W. Hathaway, young Philadelphian, has been sent to
                           the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, in Bowie, Maryland, after a week’s exhibition at
                           the Art Alliance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1577">The window contains two medallions, the upper showing Mary and Martha entertaining
                           Christ, the lower, Boaz allowing Ruth to glean in his field. It is done in the twelfth-thirteenth
                           century style, with over twelve hundred separate pieces of glass. Reds and blues predominate,
                           with yellows, purples, greens and whites.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1580">Mr. Hathaway studied for seven years with Lawrence Saint at Huntingdon Valley, helping
                           with the eighteen windows Saint did for the National Cathedral in Washington during
                           that period.

                        <p id="d1177e1605">An art director is a difficult person to analyze. He must be an artist, either by
                           training or natural bent, and by the same token, he must also be a maestro, a psychologist,
                           and a brick wall, with just a dash of Simon Legree thrown in.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1608">The Philadelphia Art News wanted us to track one down and see what it was all about.
                           Naturally, we thought of Charles E. Coiner, who guides the art trends and impulses
                           of N. W. Ayer &amp; Son.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1612">Coiner graciously granted us an interview and accordingly we met him in his office
                           on the ninth floor of the big white building on Washington Square, West.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1615">His office is plainness itself. The only pictures it boasts are some superb reproductions
                           of interiors done by a new water color process, and a pile of proofs, impressively
                           mounted and left in lonely array against the wall.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1618">We questioned him first about the prevalence of photographs in the advertisement pages
                           of the magazines. Coiner believes the fault lies with the artists themselves. Too
                           many artists have been taught by the schools to look down on advertising as a means
                           of expression. If they could be brought to realize that a magazine page can have as
                           much dignity as an art gallery, they could reach a much wider audience, be decently
                           remunerated, and still retain their standing in the field of art. Coiner feels that
                           if a Rembrandt were painting today, his works would be sought eagerly by appreciative
                           advertisers. The scarcity of really excellent work, and the hesitancy of capable men
                           to accept advertising commissions have forced many clients to turn to the camera,
                           and consequently we have a plethora of color photographs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1621">Coiner spoke proudly of some of the men whose work has been bought for Ayer clients.
                           We mentioned an old enthusiasm of ours, a portrait of Paderewski by the Spanish painter
                           Zuloaga, for Steinway pianos. Sharing our feeling, the A. D. pointed out that it ranked
                           with Zuloaga’s best work and in no way compromised the Spaniard’s integrity as an
                           artist. Incidentally, Zuloaga received $15,000 for the painting, which must be an
                           all time high for an advertising commission. Rockwell Kent is another big name employed
                           for the same account, and an original work by Alexander Brook, noted modernist, has
                           just been acquired for Steinway.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1624">Coiner walked across the room and picked up the pile of proofs. Here was a Buk Ulreich,
                           an abstract for a liner account. And this next one, a Cassandre, a beauty in full
                           color for a page ad in the Saturday Evening Post. It was a Dole Hawaiian Pineapple
                           Juice advertisement, with no copy save the name of the product and its maker. Here
                           was another Cassandre, a full color page that ran in Fortune for a lumber account.
                           Coiner considers the Frenchman tops in the poster field, and recalls that the now
                           famous Ford V-8 billboard elicited very little response from his own art staff. That
                           was the poster in which Cassandre employed a surrealist mannerism, with the manufacturer’s
                           symbol implanted in a huge human ear. This particular work was one of Coiner’s pets,
                           and was greeted enthusiastically by Edsel Ford and his sales staff.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1627">For another account, the agency retained a German designer to make the engineering
                           field tractor conscious. Going into trade journals, and approaching highly exacting
                           prospects, the designer went modern in a manner accenting in both type and photograph
                           the rugged characteristics of the product. It clicked beautifully.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1631">Coiner pointed out another artist, our own Robert Riggs, as an example of one who
                           does commercial work that ranks on a par with the work done by the same man for exhibition
                           purposes. Riggs has an enviable reputation as a lithographer, yet his assignments
                           are done in the same spirit as the work which is eagerly sought by discerning collectors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1634">James Williamson, whose ultra smart sophisticates look perfectly at home in a Ford
                           or a Yardley of London ad, was beguiled from magazine illustration to his present
                           preoccupation, and Philadelphian H. Rudolph Pott continues to do well by Bermuda in
                           ads run by the island playground.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1637">Naturally it takes an adequate art force to service the many clients on the Ayer roster,
                           and Coiner’s office is surrounded by the glassed-in cubicles of twenty-five layout
                           men. Four of these men are supervisors who act as liaison officers between their colleagues
                           and the A. D.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1640">Coiner’s task must be a pleasant one. He works with the finest materials available
                           and his co-workers are aces in their particular field. His task is to catch the eye
                           of the reading public and make it conscious of the products of some of the biggest
                           names in the business and manufacturing world. That he has succeeded can be gathered
                           from the number of medals from the Art Directors’ Annuals that Ayers has garnered
                           with almost boring regularity.

                        <p id="d1177e1643">Tall, rangy after the manner of an oarsman, Coiner suggests the Latin in appearance.
                           He has a small mustache, a well-balanced voice and a smooth, unruffled way of using
                           it.

                           by a six-year interlude in Chicago with Erwin Wasey &amp; Co. He lives in New Hope, Pa.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1650">Coiner has one distinction that makes him unique among his fellows, for it was he
                           who designed the now famous Blue Eagle, symbol of the N. R. A. Although he would rather
                           forget it and the phrenetic bit of public interest it brought him, it nevertheless
                           gives him the honor of having designed the most widely reproduced piece of commercial
                           art in our time.

                        <p id="d1177e1673">While it is impractical for some artists to prepare their own grounds, it is far more
                           undesirable for them to use defective grounds of the trade which will impair the luminosity
                           or durability of their work. Reputable dealers are supplying excellent grounds for
                           painting. However, “bargains” in canvas or panels may be had which turn out badly
                           in use because of their faulty preparation. When buying prepared canvas or panels,
                           one should be very sure of the quality of the fabric and the ingredients of the grounds.
                           A way of learning the finer points of good grounds is to prepare one’s own.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1676">Home-made grounds have many advantages. One can provide himself with precisely the
                           surface quality he likes best. He can evolve a formula suited to his personal technique.
                           He knows exactly what goes into his grounds. He can prepare canvasses and panels of
                           any reasonable size or shape to fit specific commissions.

                        <p id="d1177e1873">There are two kinds of students encountered in the Secondary School Art Class. Those
                           whose interest is purely advocational and those who look forward to art school and
                           a life spent in one of the varied fields of creative endeavor. Our approach to student
                           number one is not so intensive as that to student number two, but the plan we follow
                           is in general much the same. Each must be given the chance to experiment in as many
                           media as possible and in a variety of fields.

                        <p id="d1177e1877">At once we hear the cry of “Where will the money come from? Where will we get the
                           time?” When I hear art teachers say this I think of one thing only: if they are competent
                           teachers those materials will be forthcoming no matter how poor the school. I mean
                           just that. All the recognized media of the art world and most of the processes can
                           be had and taught with careful budgeting of the money allowed your department by the
                           school board and by addition if necessary of materials and tools gathered from every
                           source imaginable. You’ll surprise yourself by getting any number of things needed
                           if you or the children want them badly enough. They’ll help. Start them collecting
                           a kit of tools for their own use. They can ask for them for Xmas and Birthdays; they
                           can come out of pocket money; the department can sell candy if need be to get a block
                           printing press or a gas burner for a kiln. My point is that if there is need and desire
                           for a thing, that thing can be had, and the teacher who discourages the interest in
                           such things should, if he’s not too satisfied with himself, sit down to a protracted
                           period of self-examination.

                           Instead of buying prepared modeling wax, why don’t you use clay, and go directly to
                           the original source for it, that clay you can use, too, in your potter work. The money
                           we can save then on paper and wax we can use for brushes and carving tools or stone-mason’s
                           chisels.

                           work. This is fundamentally wrong pedagogically. Interest is the fundamental thing
                           to my way of thinking—and must be fostered to enable any art department to function

                           by Scribners, as we feel it is of importance historically as well as artistically.
                           Not only does he trace Nineteenth Century painting from its beginnings to the end
                           thereof, but he has a way of tying it up with History that tends to make it an excitingly
                           alive document.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1944">Mr. Laver has put in print many things which we will be mumbling to ourself for some
                           time. May we quote? “The admired artist is no longer the master craftsman, but the
                           prophet. He paints no longer for the glory of God, or even for the glory of the Venetian
                           Senate; he paints for his own glory, for the presentation of his own conception of
                           the universe, for the promulgation of his own message.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d1177e1947">We commend the above to your serious consideration. Drawing and subject matter have
                           in the last century become more and more subservient to message, for, as Mr. Laver
                           goes on to say later, the artist’s brush has been free and his own weapon for the
                           greater part only since the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. It is perhaps this
                           sense of freedom that has caused the pendulum to swing over such radical fields. We
                           found his biographies of Nineteenth Century artists pertinent as well as inclusive.
                           The book is profusely illustrated, which, we suspect, has had much to do with the
                           rather high price of the volume. It is a worth while book, however, and we trust you
                           can afford to enjoy it.

                        <p id="d1177e1951">We have just finished reading “Fine Prints, Old and New,” by Carl Zigrosser, published
                           by Covici, Friede in New York. Here is a book at a price within the reach of all,
                           that we feel is definitely worth while. It is a challenging little volume with rather
                           disturbing and thought-provoking questions asked of the reader. May we ask you one?
                           “Is there any difference between old and modern prints?” Mr. Zigrosser more or less
                           stopped us on that one. Showing us equal distortion in the work of old masters and
                           modern men.

                        <p id="d1177e1954">He rather explodes the limited edition racket, going into some detail on the subject
                           of steel facing plates. The book has much to do with practical economics and points
                           out the much greater popularity and the wider audience that existed in the field of
                           prints when they were within a moderate price range. It is something for our etchers
                           to think about.

                        <p id="d1177e2051">That T. Bayard Beatty, Jr., instructor in the Fine Arts at Northeast High School,
                           and authority on Scottish Weapons, Dress, and Customs, has done the research for the
                           booklet published by the Botany Tie people to introduce their Tartan neckwear!

                        <p id="d1177e2055">And apropos of the above: that Local Jeweler is showing one of the most amazing collections
                           of old Scottish Jewelry that has ever been our good fortune to see. When we were in
                           his store the other day and bought a piece which seemed to us most reasonably priced,
                           our eye was taken by a pair of candlesticks done in aluminum, that metal so congenial
                           to both the amateur and the professional craftsman!
