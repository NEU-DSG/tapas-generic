                              Anne's father, the great William Makepeace Thackeray, grandparents, and sister, along
                              with

                              own—are thrown into the brew to produce as complete a picture as she can of her father's
                              daughter, rather than a writer's daughter, who is herself also a writer.

                              one…begins to judge, or to make excuses, or to think about one's companions instead

                              Anne's skills as a "memorist," to borrow her own suggestive term, is her capacity
                              to capture these moments as if she were still eight years old, remembering characters
                              like
                              "Jasmin the poet" (a French hairdresser turned bard) and her own grandparents as they
                              were, rather than remembering her impressions of them.

                              during the Victorian period, as Nicholas Dames has argued; and Ritchie both witnessed
                              and
                              contributed to its conceptualization.

                           <p id="d148524e236">Until the 1840s, the word "celebrity" wasn't yet used to refer to a famous, or
                              celebrated, person; Victorians at the time would have been more familiar with the
                              term
                              "notable" or (as Ritchie uses the term on her first page), "notability," a
                              person understood as famous only within a certain social, political, or cultural group.
                              Many,
                              like Thomas Carlyle (another of the "notabilities" of Ritchie's pages), were
                              deeply suspicious of "common 
                              <hi id="d148524e238" style="font-style: italic;">Lionism</hi>," which he felt "ruins
                              innumerable men"—like poor Robbie Burns. There is a perversion in the public process
                              of the
                              ordinary man becoming a lion, and the Victorians were cautious of the dangers in that
                              kind of
                              "untamable" fame

                              father is considered to have coined the term "celebrity," first as a journalist and

                              </bibl>. Within these few lines, Honeyman articulates
                              the shift from notability to celebrity. Dames argues that Honeyman's being a
                              "fashionable preacher…so well informed about such medical, political, and literary
                              celebrities argues well enough for their status as celebrities"

                              </bibl>. The celebrity, then, is marked for his being known outside the
                              circle in which he has established himself—the literary celebrity, for example, is
                              known to
                              members outside the literary community. Importantly, the threatening—even ravaging—process
                              of
                              lionizing is absent here; becoming a celebrity allows one to live among others of
                              the same rank
                              and thus above the influence of those who have been excluded.

                           <p id="d148524e279">Anne's birth was a strange one: as her mother was about to give birth, the doctor
                              recommended by her paternal grandmother proved so incompetent that Thackeray was forced
                              to rush
                              out and find a replacement. He was just beginning his literary career when Anne was
                              born; as a
                              result, the family was poor for most of her childhood. Their second child, Jane Thackeray,
                              died
                              at 8 months, and after the birth of Harriet Marian ("Minnie") in 1840, their mother,
                              Isabella, began to suffer from depression. While on holiday in Margate, Isabella nearly
                              drowned
                              her eldest daughter in the sea, but then changed her mind and pulled Anne back out
                              of the water.
                              After a suicide attempt on the way to Ireland (when she threw herself into the sea),
                              Isabella
                              spent two years traveling with Thackeray to find a cure for her condition. She would
                              eventually
                              be placed in a house near Paris until her death in 1894, outliving her husband by
                              thirty-one
                              years. Meanwhile, he himself began to suffer from a stricture of the urethra that
                              would plague
                              him for the rest of his life.

                              despite their completely dissimilar personalities, partly for the sake of Leslie and
                              Minnie's mentally handicapped daughter, Laura. In 1877, Anne married her second cousin,
                              Raymond Thackeray Ritchie. He would eventually work at the India Office after graduating
                              from
                              Cambridge, and ultimately became the undersecretary of state for India. But he was

                              reportedly discovered the two on the couch of Anne's sitting-room. With Ritchie, Anne

                              plagued her father as well as her husband, eventually forced the family to move to

                              mother's house in 1886.

                              of Angelica Kaufmann. In 1862, she made the first of many trips to the Isle of Wight
                              (England's largest island, located in the English Channel, just south of Southampton

                              quickly
                              became a member. It included author, fellow photographer, and mathematician Lewis

                              Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who became a close friend. In 1876, Anne contributed a memoir
                              to a book
                              of photographic portraits about Tennyson and his circle, taken by Cameron. In that

                              Anne and Raymond spent a summer near the home of John Ruskin, and the two became friends.

                              was a series of longer introductions to her father's works, published in 1897 and

                              Though Thackeray had ordered that no biography of him should be written, through her
                              introductions Anne was able to produce an impression of her father's domestic life,
                              partially as a response to harsh criticisms that had been leveled against him. Her
                              husband died
                              unexpectedly in 1912, and in 1918 she and her daughter moved to the Isle of Wight.

                              </bibl>, just prior to Minnie and Leslie's marriage. It is another
                              example of Anne's rich knowledge of French life. The novel's heroine, Catherine
                              George, is a poor governess living in London who falls in love with her employer's
                              nephew,
                              a dilettante artist named Dick Butler. Dick, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Reine
                              Chretien,
                              who manages a farm in Normandy. After realizing that her own love is hopeless, Catherine
                              marries
                              M. Fontaine, a middle-aged bureaucrat. When she is suddenly widowed, though, Dick
                              starts to make
                              cautious advances towards her as he becomes keenly aware of the difference in his
                              and
                              Reine's social positions. Ultimately, Catherine unites Dick and Reine. The Village
                              on the
                              Cliff employs external situations and objects as indicative of interpersonal relationships
                              and
                              individual states of mind—techniques that would be developed in the twentieth century
                              by
                              Virginia Woolf, Leslie Stephen's daughter by his second marriage, whom Anne treated
                              always
                              as her own niece.
