                        <p id="d114937e191">We must recognize the possibility that some Federal agency or Bureau of the Fine Arts,
                           such as that proposed in the Coffee-Pepper Bill, will be established through the frantic
                           efforts of its proponents.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e194">Mere condemnation of the proposal may be insufficient to guard against the creation
                           of a harmful Bureau. More positive action is vitally necessary and urgent.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e197">An effort to revise the Coffee-Pepper Bill and to remove its abuses proved to be impracticable
                           because the basic construction of the bill is faulty. Therefore an entirely new bill
                           has been devised by a committee of Philadelphians. It is reprinted in full in this
                           issue of the Philadelphia Art News, as a tentative and unofficial proposal.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e201">This Bill strives to create an independent Federal Bureau of the Fine Arts which would
                           foster the national culture over a long period for the general welfare.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e204">Instead of being a machine for the creation and production of innumerable works of
                           art, it would be a service agency for the Arts as a whole.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e207">Its administrative personnel would be chosen by democratic representation of the cultural
                           elements of society. It would insure bona fide qualifications of every employee under
                           the Bureau. It would aid artists in all the Arts in the solution of their technical
                           problems. It would stimulate the use and patronage of the Arts by all the people and
                           in foreign countries, in such a way as not to compete with private enterprises in
                           the Arts.

                        <p id="d114937e210">Immediate concerted action on the problem of a Federal Bureau of the Fine Arts is
                           imperative. We urge your thoughtful study of this Bill.

                           a Memorial Exhibition of works by the late Hugh Breckenridge. Abstractionist, portraitist,
                           painter of still life and landscape, lithographer, Hugh Breckenridge was not only
                           one of Philadelphia’s finest artists but one of its most inspiring teachers.

                        <p id="d114937e564">For forty-three years Breckenridge taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts,
                           giving memorable counsel to literally hundreds of students. In addition to summer
                           teaching at the Darby School of Painting and at the Chester Springs Summer School,
                           in later years he had his own art school at Rocky Neck, Gloucester, Mass., where all
                           kinds and classes of students were encouraged and stimulated.

                        <p id="d114937e576">The Kodak International Exhibit, held at the Bellevue-Stratford last week was composed
                           of a hundred and sixty prints by amateur photographers from nineteen countries. Here
                           were photographs of landscape, action, city scenes, children, animals, flowers, still
                           life, in a variety of techniques as great as that of the subject matter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e579">Two of the most interesting subdivisions of the show were those devoted to infra-red
                           and to color photography. Until recently these fields of camera work were almost exclusively
                           in the hands of professionals. Now, through development of materials and the ever
                           increasing simplification of processes, the amateur may successfully experiment with
                           recording the details of distant landscape or in reproducing the actual colors of
                           his subject.

                        <p id="d114937e582">Prints by two Philadelphians were included in this exhibition, Eric Miller contributing
                           the action picture “Parachute Jumper” and Francis Kaiser, a study of railroad tracks,
                           “Perspective”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e585">A very interesting exhibit of European photography may be seen at N. W. Ayer &amp; Son’s
                           this month. Although only a few artists apparently have produced the many photographs,
                           the range of subjects is extremely wide, the topics treated diverse. The numerous
                           studies of a baby by George A. Thompson certainly mark one of the attractions of the
                           exhibit; crowds in ballrooms, on boatdecks and sun terraces; sport, with many camera
                           studies of tennis action; and topical pictures—such as the half-destroyed, falling,
                           blazing dirigible, with running crowds through the night—dramatic, and illustrative
                           of the best in news photography. Other studies of fabrics, or the arrangement of people
                           and objects are little masterpieces of design. The artistic value of these pictures
                           is high; the choice of material stimulates the imagination.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e589">A different choice of subject matter marks the First Annual Photographic Exhibition
                           at the Academy of Natural Sciences. Here, the photographs emphasize the use of the
                           extremely fine modern cameras in the field of natural science—for instance photographs
                           of the Rocky Mountain Goat in his natural habitat, the magnified design of a butterfly’s
                           wing and of insects, and the terrifying head of a cat,—Sam’s Head, which gives a very
                           good idea of what a cat’s head must look like to a tiny bird. Two splendid views of
                           the Rocky Mountain range under snow should not be missed. It’s altogether an interesting
                           exhibit but more specialized than the one at Ayer’s.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e592">Another very fine camera exhibition is that at Strawbridge &amp; Clothier’s Old York Road
                           Store, Jenkintown. The show, continuing until

                           <p id="d114937e618">The chief difference existing between the museum and privately operated gallery is
                              that the former is subsidized, while the latter is generally a corporation bound by
                              the same responsibilities as any business concern. They have goods to sell and rent
                              to pay. Here arises a knotty problem, and many misunderstandings between artist and
                              gallery are the result of just such situations.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e621">The gallery is not always right, nor is the artist. To be sure, throughout the length
                              and breadth of our country there have been many instances of an artist being mistreated
                              by his gallery. He has been taken in in all sorts of ways—his price has been cut and
                              he has had to wait too long for his money. Sometimes he has not received it at all.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e624">The artist’s differences with such a gallery are of course entirely justified, except
                              for the fact that his woes are frequently induced by his gullibility and he constitutes
                              an easy target for such institutions. We are certain, however, that the general complexion
                              of American art galleries is by no means so bilious as this.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e627">Furthermore, most disagreements with galleries are really misunderstandings of the
                              gallery’s vital problem of existence. Many galleries who not only conduct their business
                              admirably but do so with an ideal, have much ado to meet their financial obligations.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e631">Broadly, there are two kinds of substantial private galleries: the conservative, marketing
                              only the “arrived” in art; and the modern and more progressive, who, in the name of
                              art, are willing to share the burden of the promising young artist.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e634">Needless to say, the former is often the more successful—and, incidentally, less wholeheartedly
                              devoted to American art than the latter. Their practical problems, however, are quite
                              similar, although we may dismiss those buying foreign names and selling them for profit
                              as aside from our present considerations.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e637">We may be sure of one thing: no galleries are rolling in a wealth of profit, and it
                              is amazing that some galleries continue to function in the face of such discouragement.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e640">Then comes an even stranger fact: that with all of it the artist finds himself, as
                              frequently as not, paying through the nose. Particularly uncomfortable when he has
                              not the wherewithal to pay.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e643">In New York, we believe, for purposes of a one-man show, the average rental for a
                              gallery ranges from fifty to one hundred dollars per week—to most artists a considerable
                              expense—while to this is added the cost of the catalogue, printed invitations to a
                              private view, if any, and the purchase of advertising space. Should the artist sell
                              a work, the gallery deducts its commission. Group shows have also been given wherein
                              each contributing artist was charged, we are told, ten dollars per week for the duration
                              of the show.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e646">This surely assumes that many artists are affluent—more so than we believe them to
                              be, at any rate. We are further informed that most galleries find hard sledding even
                              in this way. As a matter of fact, the average overhead of a New York Gallery is sixty-five
                              dollars per day.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e650">There is another, and distinctly vicious, angle to this situation. When hard pressed,
                              a gallery may frequently find itself tempted to accept and hang an exhibition of work
                              by an inferior painter who happens to have the requisite cash. Such a practice is
                              a death blow to the moral and ethical duty of the gallery: to present only the best
                              in living art.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e653">The promising but poor painter has not much of a chance here, and will never have,
                              until this chaotic state is more practically organized. It can be done when artist
                              and gallery get together and consider everything impartially.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e656">The gallery, if given a workable plan, would be glad to cooperate.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e659">But the artist must cooperate too.</p>

                           <p id="d114937e673">Since Benjamin West departed this life, in 1820, his work has fallen into mild disrepute
                              as far as many members of the artistic cognocenti are concerned. It has been fashionable
                              to sneer at the canvases of this grand old man, and we’ve done a bit of it ourselves.
                              However, a visit to the present Bicentenary Exhibition of West’s work at the Pennsylvania
                              Museum will prove, in little less than startling fashion, that he remains at his best,
                              one of America’s finest painters.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e677">In this exhibit it is possible to trace West’s growth and development from its earliest
                              period to maturity and much is to be learned concerning the artistic influences of
                              his life.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e680">The earliest canvases are two small portrait heads executed when the painter was but
                              fourteen years of age—both amazing primitives. Of equal primitive charm is an early
                              landscape with its trees, river, bridge, ship and figures as quaintly conceived as
                              the cow that grazes contentedly in the shade.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e683">Two of the last commissions executed by West prior to his journey to London—portraits
                              of William Henry, Lancaster locksmith, and his wife Ann—offer an interesting comparison
                              to later work accomplished on other shores. Notable among these is a life-size double
                              portrait of the two sons of the Earl of Kinnoull. One of the finest portraits ever
                              executed by the painter is that of Sir William Young, a monument of pigment finely
                              controlled. Mr. and Mrs. John Custance have been immortalized on a large and rather
                              flamboyant canvas in which love is rampant. Two cupids dart hither and yon, and Mr.
                              Custance leans quite comfortably upon the shoulder of another.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e686">One of the most remarkable lessons to be learned from this exhibit is that when it
                              suited him, West could be as bold and free in treatment as the next. The portrait
                              of Dr. Enoch Edwards manifests a great deal of this in the upper right hand corner
                              of the canvas, where drapery has been indicated with vigorous, colorful brush strokes
                              of a quality definitely suggestive of impressionism.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e689">To the major portion of Philadelphia art lovers, West’s most famous canvas is probably
                              his epic “Death on the Pale Horse”, a comparatively stupid work which, it appears,
                              was not entirely from his own hand. Infinitely more vital are two original sketches
                              for this composition, to be seen here. Both have the freedom and fire reminiscent
                              of Delacroix or Gericault. They are certainly far removed from the grace of pigmental
                              politeness of West’s portraits.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e692">The show is augmented by a number of the painter’s drawings and three canvases by
                              Matthew Pratt, one a portrait of West, another of the painter’s wife, the third known
                              as “The American School” in which Pratt himself is represented receiving art instruction
                              from West.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e696">“I want an art that is disturbing,” writes Nicholas Marsicano in the catalogue of
                              his present one-man exhibition at the A. C. A. Gallery.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e699">This statement is not only an excellent summing-up of the painter’s aesthetic philosophy,
                              but an accomplished fact. Undoubtedly these canvases are the most “disturbing” we’ve
                              seen in a long while. Disturbing because they are forthright statements of the reactions
                              of a mind, emotional sensibility and talent that respond fruitfully to more than one
                              element of life.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e702">As a man Marsicano is enormously sensitive to social conditions—as an artist he has
                              a violent affection for pigment at its lustiest. When purely visional, we find Marsicano’s
                              canvases zestful, poetic, and in love with the sun, trees, hills and picturesque architecture
                              of Morocco and Corsica.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e705">However, with increasing frequency this painter’s inherent interest in the human problem
                              is making itself felt in his oils. (The canvases in this show have been chosen from
                              his last three years’ work.) A marked change in style is to be noted when the artist’s
                              eye passes from landscape to his fellow men. Hs is equally, if not more, concerned
                              with their lives than their looks, and has developed a simple, dramatically expressive
                              distortion that gets pictorially to the core of his message. In this he is not too
                              far removed from Rouault.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e708">The strongest canvases are “Hunger Marchers” and “Portrait of a Man,” both stark,
                              powerful, uncompromising and exceedingly rich in lusty color. Three canvases, known
                              as “Spain, Invasion”, depend largely, and successfully, upon the tragic quality of
                              their angles, and leave little doubt that the woes of another land have given tremendous
                              emotional impetus to the art of Marsicano.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e711">To judge by her present showing of canvases at the Warwick Galleries, the art of Hortense
                              Ferne is growing, not only in dimension, but content. In these works there is manifest
                              increasing emotional range and greater subtlety of vision.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d114937e715">Spain is seen with poetic eye and harmonious palette—most unusual in contrast to the

                              Likewise in full regalia is the “Indian”—a piece of strong, vigorous, but not vivid,

                              is a refutation of those critics who affirm that the ‘proletarian artist’ is always
                              so engrossed in Marxist dialectics that his painter’s vision is obscured. Although
                              there are still too many paintings in the exhibition that seem to have been dashed
                              off for purely propagandist purposes without regard for aesthetic value, the group
                              of really excellent pictures included more than compensates for the mediocrity of

                           <p id="d114937e755">Joe Jones’ “Corn” mirrors the devastation of the drought area, flat greys and browns
                              depicting four withered stalks in a desolated field. There is bitterness here, but
                              emotional values have been so welded with pictorial, that “Corn” is satisfying as
                              a painting, regardless of its message. Joe Hirsch, in “Landscape with Tear Gas,” a
                              condemnation of a steel strike, achieves vital design by contrasting the positive
                              lengths of low red steel plants with masses of battling strikers and police in the
                              foreground. A fiery, torn sky intensifies the somberness of the theme. These two paintings
                              represent the so-called art of social consciousness at its best. Each has a very definite
                              ‘meaning’, but the meaning has been so integrated with form that we receive aesthetic
                              enjoyment as well as political theories.

                              concrete revelations of the English and French temperaments. “Le Sommeil de Diana”
                              or “Venus, a la Colombe” reveals the essentially frivolous attitude of 18th century
                              France; “Disobedience Detected,” the sentimentalized anecdote which occupied the British

                              that the average tourist photographs—she paints in bright colors and simple patterns.
                              This exhibition is indeed a record of places and incidents that she has loved, and
                              wished to preserve.

                              Women’s University Club, typifies this painter’s peculiarly quiet point of view. Three
                              pigeons, two white and one buff, preen placidly on a flat roof; in the background
                              are bare trees and a row of salmon brick houses. As in most of her pictures, the color
                              is so lightened with white that there seems to be almost a veil between scene and
                              spectator. It is not a dramatic painting, but one feels in it a sensitivity to the
                              nuances of the city scene. “English Landscape”, interpreted in the warm tans of turned
                              fields and the light greens of thinly leafed trees and bushes, has similar qualities
                              of repose and quiet lyricism.

                              early 19th century “The Temple of Flora,” are outstanding not only for their botanical
                              accuracy, but even more for the intensely decorative manner in which they have been
                              conceived. Essentially formal in design, each flower has been placed against an elaborate
                              background that in some way reflects the form of the plant. In “The White Lily” the
                              background contains a small white marble temple that echoes the chaste lines of the
                              lily; behind a blue Egyptian water lily rise a group of eastern palaces; the orange
                              swirls of the night-blooming cereus burn against the romantic sitting of a German
                              castle in a moon-lit forest.

                              an artist who looks at her world independently—and independently reshapes that world
                              on paper. Although her heavy black accents are occasionally reminiscent of Roualt
                              or the caricatures of Daumier, one feels that she is an original painter. With themes
                              ranging from the tenseness of “Strike Meeting” to the formal placidity of the still
                              life, “Cucumber and Squash,” she has always a fine sense of form and a feeling for
                              expressive color.

                              pictures. Elizabeth Coyne’s “Flowers and Mirror,” which was awarded the Gold Medal,
                              is a study in reflections—those of the vase in the mirror and of the brilliant flowers
                              in the surface of the black vase. The Silver Award went to Jean Watson for “Massachusetts
                              Quarry,” a grey and green design of rock forms and landscape. Honorable Mentions were
                              awarded to Florence Whiting’s “Flowers,” a decorative composition of red gladioli,
                              and to Alice Robert’s “Tully Connemara,” a small Irish village at the foot of the

                              the country scene. Using many soft, intermediate tones, he is especially skillful
                              in rendering atmospheric effects—November sunlight, the rising of the mist at Nantucket,
                              the darkness of an apple cellar. Again, his interest in the shapes and textures of
                              trees is evinced in such prints as “The Tree in the Field”, “Wild Apple”, or “The
                              Spice Bush”. “Tapestry of Spring”, a pattern in leaves and light, expresses his feeling
                              for the naturalistic designs found in underbrush and thin woods.

                           spent a great part of his life in London, where he painted many noted Englishmen and
                           Europeans of his day. Among the famous statesmen who sat for him were Gladstone, Bismarck,
                           Arthur Balfour, Lord Halifax, Asquith and Henri Rochefort. King George V was the subject
                           of a series of original lithographs which are to be included in the sale.

                           greater effect than this house which has seen advertising grow to the present tremendous
                           influence it now enjoys. The agency presented to the buying public at least two trademarks
                           or symbols that became part of the national consciousness, the apple-cheeked Campbell
                           Kids, whose chubby features spoke loudly for the effects of a soup diet and the attentive
                           fox-terrier who made “His Master’s Voice” a byword that brought Victrolas into so
                           many homes.

                           his intelligent efforts the show was not only made well balanced and beautiful but
                           was given a comprehensive meaning.

                           carry a message to the intelligent observer. To the Manufacturer—a deeper understanding
                           of what the designer has done and will do in creating beautiful objects for greater
                           sales distribution. To the Consumer—a greater realization of what intelligent mass
                           production has done in providing for his use more beautiful every-day articles at
                           a price he can afford. To the Designer—a comprehensive statement of the vast possibilities
                           for his peculiar talents in this field of design—the Craftsmanship of the Machine.

                        <p id="d114937e1515">Some have said that this field of design is ideal for the architect, due to his peculiar
                           training with the uses of materials, knowledge of their properties and functions,
                           coupled with his sense of design. But there are many phases of industrial design that
                           are foreign to the natural equipment of the architect. He does not use mass production
                           methods in attaining his individualistic result. He inherently resents repetition.
                           Each building he designs is created especially for a special need or the need of a
                           special individual. He is not particularly interested in mass sociology or psychology.
                           The merchandizing he knows or uses in his work is vitally different from that necessary
                           for mass selling. He, in most cases, does not work well as part of a co-ordinating
                           group as is necessary in mass production.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e1518">Where can we turn to find the individuals or groups of individuals that come all ready
                           made for the ever increasing field of industrial design? I have come to the conclusion
                           that despite all these differences the architect is as good a bet as any. He is concerned
                           in increasing beauty to surround the individual. The individual must have mass production
                           items around him. If the architect will realize and understand the peculiar set-up
                           necessary in this Design for Mass Production, he can contribute immeasurably to the
                           increase of Beauty in the world in which we must live.

                           It does not attempt to teach the geography of the past, and the historian’s or misinformed
                           social scientist’s attitude that geography and history can be fused, is in error.
                           It has been said that History is the Geography of the Past.

                        <p id="d114937e1615">Human Ecology for boys and girls of our public schools should have the following criteria:
                           1. It should base its first formal teachings upon those things which the child has
                           observed in his pre-geography years. 2. It should evolve from the simple to the complex.
                           Here we must eliminate History, for History had its beginnings in very complicated
                           regions if we think in terms of human adjustments. 3. There should not be repetition
                           of subject matter, but there can be repetition of principles taught, in interpreting
                           new subject matter.

                        <p id="d114937e1618">The aim of the Geographer with the progressive viewpoint is to give the boy or girl
                           graduating from school as broad a background in interpreting HOME environments as
                           he should have in the arts, sciences, literature, or other fields. Americans are frequently
                           characterized as being woefully illiterate, geographically, with their old-fashioned
                           ideas of sailor, place, and physical geography. Human Ecology, which is the special
                           realm of Geography, aims to make citizens literate in interpreting the cultural landscape
                           in relation to the physical landscape.

                        <p id="d114937e1621">The artist deals with things and ideas taken from the cultural and physical landscapes
                           of man. It is here man has his home. When the world’s peoples know more about their
                           planet plus its social patterns they will be better able to understand the products
                           of the artists. For example, one cannot fully appreciate the paintings of the Florentine
                           artists until he has a mind picture of Florence, Italy, and has interpreted the canvases
                           as the products of a particular physical and social environment. Art can be made more
                           meaningful to the child in any school, be it progressive or archaic, when there has
                           been built for him a background of tolerant geographic understandings.

                           consideration of the tentative proposal of the informal Philadelphia committee. It
                           was decided to preserve the affiliation of the groups represented at the meeting.
                           Henry White Taylor was formally made chairman, and Joseph A. Fraser, secretary.

                           and distributed in this country by the Oxford University Press of New York, ($3.00).

                        <p id="d114937e1912">We frankly regret it does not seem to be possible for the presses of our own country
                           to make such an ambitious volume as this available to the public at such a reasonable
                           price.

                        <p id="d114937e1915">Why must America take a back seat? Surely our facilities compare more than favorably
                           with those of Europe. Is it perhaps because our countrymen are still inclined to consider
                           art a luxury to be paid for through the nose?

                        <p id="d114937e1918">The introduction by Fritz Novotny contains a good approach to the painter’s work.
                           He warns against regarding a Cezanne merely as an ornament in colour. One must look
                           for its realistic illustrative value.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d114937e1922">He speaks of Cezanne’s powers of reduction which distinguish his work from that of
                           preceding impressionists. His aloofness from mankind is offered as explanation for
                           the puppet-like rigidity of the nudes to be found, for example in the much maligned
                           “Bathers” at the Museum.
