                           <p id="d193447e208">WHEN I was a boy, there was but
                              one permanent ambition among my comrades
                              in our village on the west bank of
                              the Mississippi River. That was, to
                              be a steamboatman. We had transient
                              ambitions of other sorts, but they were
                              only transient. When a circus came
                              and went, it left us all burning to become
                              clowns; the first negro minstrel
                              show that came to our section left us all
                              suffering to try that kind of life; now
                              and then we had a hope that if we lived
                              and were good, God would permit us to
                              be pirates. These ambitions faded out,
                              each in its turn; but the ambition to be
                              a steamboatman always remained.

                           <p id="d193447e211">Once a day a cheap, gaudy packet
                              arrived upward from St. Louis, and another
                              downward from Keokuk. Before
                              these events had transpired, the day
                              was glorious with expectancy; after they
                              had transpired, the day was a dead and
                              empty thing. Not only the boys, but
                              the whole village, felt this. After all
                              these years I can picture that old time
                              to myself now, just as it was then: the
                              white town drowsing in the sunshine of
                              a summer's morning; the streets empty,
                              or pretty nearly so; one or two clerks
                              in front of the Water Street
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e213"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="1" data-tei-n="70"> </a></span>
                              stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs
                              tilted back against the wall, chins on
                              breasts, hats slouched over their faces,
                              asleep—with shingle-shavings enough
                              around to show what broke them down;
                              a sow and a litter of pigs loafing along
                              the sidewalk, doing a good business in
                              water-melon rinds and seeds; two or
                              three lonely little freight piles scattered
                              about the “levee;” a pile of “skids”
                              on the slope of the stone-paved wharf,
                              and the fragrant town drunkard asleep
                              in the shadow of them; two or three
                              wood flats at the head of the wharf, but
                              nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping
                              of the wavelets against them; the great
                              Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent
                              Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide
                              tide along, shining in the sun; the
                              dense forest away on the other side;
                              the “point” above the town, and the
                              “point” below, bounding the river-glimpse
                              and turning it into a sort of
                              sea, and withal a very still and brilliant
                              and lonely one. Presently a film of
                              dark smoke appears above one of those
                              remote “points;” instantly a negro
                              drayman, famous for his quick eye
                              and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry,
                              “S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!” and the
                              scene changes! The town drunkard
                              stirs, the clerks wake up, a furious
                              clatter of drays follows, every house
                              and store pours out a human contribution,
                              and all in a twinkling the dead
                              town is alive and moving. Drays, carts,
                              men, boys, all go hurrying from many
                              quarters to a common centre, the wharf.
                              Assembled there, the people fasten their
                              eyes upon the coming boat as upon a
                              wonder they are seeing for the first
                              time. And the boat is rather a handsome
                              sight, too. She is long and sharp
                              and trim and pretty; she has two tall,
                              fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded
                              device of some kind swung between
                              them; a fanciful pilot-house, all glass
                              and “gingerbread,” perched on top of
                              the “texas” deck behind them; the
                              paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture
                              or with gilded rays above the boat's
                              name; the boiler deck, the hurricane
                              deck, and the texas deck are fenced and
                              ornamented with clean white railings;
                              there is a flag gallantly flying from the
                              jack-staff; the furnace doors are open
                              and the fires flaring bravely; the upper
                              decks are black with passengers; the
                              captain stands by the big bell, calm,
                              imposing, the envy of all; great volumes
                              of the blackest smoke are rolling
                              and tumbling out of the chimneys—a
                              husbanded grandeur created with a bit
                              of pitch pine just before arriving at a
                              town; the crew are grouped on the
                              forecastle; the broad stage is run far
                              out over the port bow, and an envied
                              deck-hand stands picturesquely on the
                              end of it with a coil of rope in his hand;
                              the pent steam is screaming through the
                              gauge-cocks; the captain lifts his hand,
                              a bell rings, the wheels stop; then they
                              turn back, churning the water to foam,
                              and the steamer is at rest. Then such
                              a scramble as there is to get aboard,
                              and to get ashore, and to take in freight
                              and to discharge freight, all at one and
                              the same time; and such a yelling and
                              cursing as the mates facilitate it all
                              with! Ten minutes later the steamer is
                              under way again, with no flag on the
                              jack-staff and no black smoke issuing
                              from the chimneys. After ten more
                              minutes the town is dead again, and the
                              town drunkard asleep by the skids once
                              more.

                           <p id="d193447e216">My father was a justice of the peace,
                              and I supposed he possessed the power
                              of life and death over all men and could
                              hang anybody that offended him. This
                              was distinction enough for me as a general
                              thing; but the desire to be a steamboatman
                              kept intruding, nevertheless.
                              I first wanted to be a cabin-boy, so that
                              I could come out with a white apron on
                              and shake a table-cloth over the side,
                              where all my old comrades could see
                              me; later I thought I would rather be
                              the deck-hand who stood on the end of
                              the stage-plank with the coil of rope in
                              his hand, because he was particularly
                              conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams—
                              they were too heavenly to be
                              contemplated as real possibilities. By
                              and by one of our boys went away. He
                              was not heard of for a long time.  At
                              last he turned up as apprentice engineer
                              or “striker” on a steamboat. This
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e218"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="2" data-tei-n="71"> </a></span>
                              thing shook the bottom out of all my
                              Sunday-school teachings. That boy had
                              been notoriously worldly, and I just the
                              reverse, yet he was exalted to this
                              eminence, and I left in obscurity and
                              misery. There was nothing generous
                              about this fellow in his greatness. He
                              would always manage to have a rusty
                              bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at
                              our town, and he would sit on the inside
                              guard and scrub it, where we could
                              all see him and envy him and loathe
                              him. And whenever his boat was laid
                              up he would come home and swell
                              around the town in his blackest and
                              greasiest clothes, so that nobody could
                              help remembering that he was a steamboatman;
                              and he used all sorts of
                              steamboat technicalities in his talk, as
                              if he were so used to them that he forgot
                              common people could not understand
                              them. He would speak of the “labboard”
                              side of a horse in an easy,
                              natural way that would make one wish
                              he was dead. And he was always
                              talking about “St. Looy” like an old
                              citizen, he would refer casually to occasions
                              when he “was coming down
                              Fourth Street,” or when he was “passing
                              by the Planter's House,” or when
                              there was a fire and he took a turn on the
                              brakes of “the old Big Missouri;” and
                              then he would go on and lie about how
                              many towns the size of ours were burned
                              down there that day. Two or three of
                              the boys had long been persons of consideration
                              among us because they had
                              been to St. Louis once and had a vague
                              general knowledge of its wonders, but
                              the day of their glory was over now.
                              They lapsed into a humble silence, and
                              learned to disappear when the ruthless
                              “cub”-engineer approached. This
                              fellow had money, too, and hair oil.
                              Also an ignorant silver watch and a
                              showy brass watch chain. He wore a
                              leather belt and used no suspenders. If
                              ever a youth was cordially admired and
                              hated by his comrades, this one was.
                              No girl could withstand his charms. He
                              “cut out” every boy in the village.
                              When his boat blew up at last, it diffused
                              a tranquil contentment among us
                              such as we had not known for months.
                              But when he came home the next week,
                              alive, renowned, and appeared in church
                              all battered up and bandaged, a shining
                              hero, stared at and wondered over
                              by everybody, it seemed to us that the
                              partiality of Providence for an undeserving
                              reptile had reached a point
                              where it was open to criticism.

                           <p id="d193447e221">This creature's career could produce
                              but one result, and it speedily followed,
                              Boy after boy managed to get on the
                              river. The minister's son became an
                              engineer. The doctor's and the postmaster's
                              sons became “mud clerks;”
                              the wholesale liquor dealer's son became
                              a bar-keeper on a boat; four sons
                              of the chief merchant, and two sons of
                              the county judge, became pilots. Pilot
                              was the grandest position of all. The
                              pilot, even in those days of trivial wages,
                              had a princely salary—from a hundred
                              and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars
                              a month, and no board to pay. Two
                              months of his wages would pay a
                              preacher's salary for a year. Now
                              some of us were left disconsolate. We
                              could not get on the river—at least
                              our parents would not let us.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e225">So by and by I ran away. I said I
                              never would come home again till I was
                              a pilot and could come in glory. But
                              somehow I could not manage it. I went
                              meekly aboard a few of the boats that
                              lay packed together like sardines at
                              the long St. Louis wharf, and very
                              humbly inquired for the pilots, but got
                              only a cold shoulder and short words
                              from mates and clerks. I had to make
                              the best of this sort of treatment for
                              the time being, but I had comforting
                              day-dreams of a future when I should
                              be a great and honored pilot, with
                              plenty of money, and could kill some
                              of these mates and clerks and pay for
                              them.

                           <p id="d193447e228">Months afterward the hope within me
                              struggled to a reluctant death, and I
                              found myself without an ambition. But
                              I was ashamed to go home. I was in
                              Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out
                              a new career. I had been reading about
                              the recent exploration of the river Amazon
                              by an expedition sent out by our
                              government. It was said that the expedition,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e230"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="3" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span>
                              owing to difficulties, had not
                              thoroughly explored a part of the country
                              lying about the head-waters, some
                              four thousand miles from the mouth of
                              the river. It was only about fifteen
                              hundred miles from Cincinnati to New
                              Orleans, where I could doubtless get a
                              ship. I had thirty dollars left; I would
                              go and complete the exploration of the
                              Amazon. This was all the thought I
                              gave to the subject. I never was great
                              in matters of detail. I packed my valise,
                              and took passage on an ancient tub
                              called the Paul Jones, for New Orleans.
                              For the sum of sixteen dollars I had
                              the scarred and tarnished splendors of
                              “her” main saloon principally to myself,
                              for she was not a creature to attract
                              the eye of wiser travelers.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e233">When we presently got under way
                              and went poking down the broad Ohio,
                              I became a new being, and the subject
                              of my own admiration. I was a traveler!
                              A word never had tasted so good
                              in my mouth before. I had all exultant
                              sense of being bound for mysterious
                              lands and distant climes which I never
                              have felt in so uplifting a degree since.
                              I was in such a glorified condition that
                              all ignoble feelings departed out of me,
                              and I was able to look down and pity
                              the untraveled with a compassion that
                              had hardly a trace of contempt in it.
                              Still, when we stopped at villages and
                              wood-yards, I could not help lolling
                              carelessly upon the railings of the
                              boiler duck to enjoy the envy of the
                              country boys on the bank. If they
                              did not seem to discover me, I presently
                              sneezed to attract their attention, or
                              moved to a position where they could
                              not help seeing me. And as soon as
                              I knew they saw me I gaped and
                              stretched, and gave other signs of being
                              mightily bored with traveling.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e236">I kept my hat off all the time, and
                              stayed where the wind and the sun could
                              strike me, because I wanted to get the
                              bronzed and weather-beaten look of an
                              old traveler. Before the second day
                              was half gone, I experienced a joy
                              which filled me with the purest gratitude;
                              for I saw that the skin had begun
                              to blister and peel off my face and neck.
                              I wished that the boys and girls at home
                              could see me now.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e239">We reached Louisville in time—at
                              least the neighborhood of it.  We stuck
                              hard and fast on the rocks in the middle
                              of the river and lay there four days.
                              I was now beginning to feel a strong
                              sense of being a part of the boat's family,
                              a sort of infant son to the captain
                              and younger brother to the officers.
                              There is no estimating the pride I took
                              in this grandeur, or the affection that
                              began to swell and grow in me for those
                              people. I could not know how the
                              lordly steamboatman scorns that sort of
                              presumption in a mere landsman. I
                              particularly longed to acquire the least
                              trifle of notice from the big stormy
                              mate, and I was on the alert for an 
                              opportunity to do him a service to that
                              end. It came at last. The riotous
                              powwow of setting a spar was going
                              on down on the forecastle, and I went
                              down there and stood around in the
                              way—or mostly skipping out of it—
                              till the mate suddenly roared a general
                              order for somebody to bring him
                              a capstan bar. I sprang to his side
                              and said: “Tell me where it is—I 'll
                              fetch it!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e242">If a rag-picker had offered to do a
                              diplomatic service for the Emperor of
                              Russia, the monarch could not have been
                              more astounded than the mate was. He
                              even stopped swearing. He stood and
                              stared down at me. It took him ten
                              seconds to scrape his disjointed remains
                              together again. Then he said impressively:
                              “Well, if this don't beat hell!”
                              and turned to his work with the air of a
                              man who had been confronted with a
                              problem too abstruse for solution.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e246">I crept away, and courted solitude for
                              the rest of the day. I did not go to
                              dinner; I stayed away from supper until
                              everybody else had finished. I did not
                              feel so much like a member of the boat's
                              family now as before. However, my
                              spirits returned, in installments, as we
                              pursued our way down the river. I was
                              sorry I hated the mate so, because it was
                              not in (young) human nature not to admire
                              him. He was huge and muscular,
                              his face was bearded and whiskered all
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e248"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="4" data-tei-n="73"> </a></span>
                              over; he had a red woman and a blue
                              woman tattooed on his right arm—one
                              on each side of a blue anchor with a red
                              rope to it; and in the matter of profanity
                              he was perfect. When he was getting
                              out cargo at a landing, I was always
                              where I could see and hear. He felt all
                              the sublimity of his great position, and
                              made the world feel it, too. When he
                              gave even the simplest order, he discharged
                              it like a blast of lightning, and
                              sent a long, reverberating peal of profanity
                              thundering after it. I could not
                              help contrasting the way in which the
                              average landsman would give an order,
                              with the mate's way of doing it. If
                              the landsman should wish the gang-plank
                              moved a foot farther forward, he
                              would probably say:  “James, or William,
                              one of you push that plank forward, please;”
                              but put the mate in his
                              place, and he would roar out: “Here,
                              now, start that gang-plank for'ard!
                              Lively, now!

                           <p id="d193447e273">When the soreness of my adventure
                              with the mate had somewhat worn off, I
                              began timidly to make up to the humblest
                              official connected with the boat—
                              the night watchman. He snubbed my
                              advances at first, but I presently ventured
                              to offer him a new chalk pipe,
                              and that softened him. So he allowed
                              me to sit with him by the big bell on the
                              hurricane deck, and in time he melted
                              into conversation. He could not well
                              have helped it, I hung with such homage
                              on his words and so plainly showed
                              that I felt honored by his notice. He
                              told me the names of dim capes and
                              shadowy islands as we glided by them in
                              the solemnity of the night, under the
                              winking stars, and by and by got to talking
                              about himself. He seemed over-sentimental
                              for a man whose salary was
                              six dollars a week—or rather he might
                              have seemed so to an older person than
                              I. But I drank in his words hungrily,
                              and with a faith that might have moved
                              mountains if it had been applied judiciously.
                              What was it to me that he
                              was soiled and seedy and fragrant with
                              gin? What was it to me that his grammar
                              was bad, his construction worse, and
                              his profanity so void of art that it was
                              an element of weakness rather than
                              strength in his conversation? He was
                              a wronged man, a man who had seen
                              trouble, and that was enough for me.
                              As he mellowed into his plaintive history
                              his tears dripped upon the lantern in his
                              lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy.
                              He said he was the son of an English
                              nobleman—either an earl or an alderman,
                              he could not remember which, but
                              believed he was both; his father, the
                              nobleman, loved him, but his mother
                              hated him from the cradle; and so while
                              he was still a little boy he was sent to
                              “one of them old, ancient colleges”—
                              he could n't remember which; and by
                              and by his father died and his mother
                              seized the property and “shook” him,
                              as he phrased it. After his mother
                              shook him, members of the nobility with
                              whom he was acquainted used their influence
                              to get him the position of “loblolly-boy
                              in a ship;” and from that
                              point my watchman threw off all trammels
                              of date and locality and branched
                              out into a narrative that bristled all
                              along with incredible adventures; a narrative
                              that was so reeking with bloodshed
                              and so crammed with hair-breadth
                              escapes and the most engaging and unconscious
                              personal villainies, that I sat
                              speechless, enjoying, shuddering, wondering,
                              worshiping.

                              an untraveled native of the wilds of Illinois,
                              who had absorbed wildcat literature
                              and appropriated its marvels, until in
                              time he had woven odds and ends of the
                              mess into this yarn, and then gone on,
                              telling it to fledglings like me, until he
                              had come to believe it himself.

                              the poor old Paul Jones fooled
                              away about two weeks in making the
                              voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans.
                              This gave me a chance to get acquainted
                              with one of the pilots, and he taught
                              me how to steer the boat, and thus made
                              the fascination of river life more potent
                              than ever for me.

                              with a youth who had taken
                              deck passage—more 's the pity; for he
                              easily borrowed six dollars of me on a

                              arrive. But he probably died or forgot,
                              for he never came. It was doubtless
                              the former, since he had said his parents
                              were wealthy, and he only traveled
                              deck passage because it was cooler. <a href="note1" class="ref-external" rend="sc">1</a>

                           <p id="d193447e321">I soon discovered two things. One
                              was that a vessel would not be likely
                              to sail for the mouth of the Amazon
                              under ten or twelve years; and the
                              other was that the nine or ten dollars
                              still left in my pocket would not suffice
                              for so imposing an exploration as I had
                              planned, even if I could afford to wait
                              for a ship. Therefore it followed that
                              I must contrive a new career. The
                              Paul Jones was now bound for St.
                              Louis. I planned a siege against my
                              pilot, and at the end of three hard days
                              he surrendered. He agreed to teach
                              me the Mississippi River from New Orleans
                              to St. Louis for five hundred dollars,
                              payable out of the first wages I
                              should receive after graduating. I entered
                              upon the small enterprise of
                              “learning” twelve or thirteen hundred
                              miles of the great Mississippi River with
                              the easy confidence of my time of life.
                              If I had really known what I was about
                              to require of my faculties, I should not
                              have had the courage to begin. I supposed
                              that all a pilot had to do was to
                              keep his boat in the river, and I did
                              not consider that that could be much of
                              a trick, since it was so wide.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e324">The boat backed out from New Orleans
                              at four in the afternoon, and it
                              was “our watch” until eight. Mr.
                              B—, my chief, “straightened her
                              up,” plowed her along past the sterns
                              of the other boats that lay at the Levee,
                              and then said, “Here, take her; shave
                              those steamships as close as you 'd peel
                              an apple.” I took the wheel, and my
                              heart went down into my boots; for it
                              seemed to me that we were about to
                              scrape the side off every ship in the
                              line, we were so close. I held my
                              breath and began to claw the boat away
                              from the danger; and I had my own
                              opinion of the pilot who had known no
                              better than to get us into such peril,
                              but I was too wise to express it. In
                              half a minute I had a wide margin of
                              safety intervening between the Paul
                              Jones and the ships; and within ten
                              seconds more I was set aside in disgrace,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e326"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="218"> </a></span>
                              and Mr. B— was going into danger
                              again and flaying me alive with abuse
                              of my cowardice. I was stung, but I
                              was obliged to admire the easy confidence
                              with which my chief loafed from
                              side to side of his wheel, and trimmed
                              the ships so closely that disaster seemed
                              ceaselessly imminent. When he had
                              cooled a little he told me that the easy
                              water was close ashore and the current
                              outside, and therefore we must hug the
                              bank, up-stream, to get the benefit of
                              the former, and stay well out, down-stream,
                              to take advantage of the latter.
                              In my own mind I resolved to be a
                              down-stream pilot and leave the up-streaming
                              to people dead to prudence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e329">Now and then Mr. B— called my
                              attention to certain things.     Said he,
                              “This is Six-Mile Point.”  I assented.
                              It was pleasant enough information, but
                              I could not see the bearing of it. I was
                              not conscious that it was a matter of
                              any interest to me. Another time he
                              said. “This is Nine-Mile Point.” Later
                              he said, “This is Twelve-Mile Point.”
                              They were all about level with the
                              water's edge; they all looked about
                              alike to me; they were monotonously
                              unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. B—
                              would change the subject. But no; he
                              would crowd up around a point, hugging
                              the shore with affection, and then
                              say: “The slack water ends here,
                              abreast this bunch of China-trees;
                              now we cross over.” So he crossed
                              over. He gave me the wheel once or
                              twice, but I had no luck. I either came
                              near chipping off the edge of a sugar
                              plantation, or else I yawed too far from
                              shore, and so I dropped back into disgrace
                              again and got abused.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e332">The watch was ended at last, and we
                              took supper and went to bed. At midnight
                              the glare of a lantern shone in my
                              eyes, and the night watchman said:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e335">“Come!; turn out!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e339">And then he left. I could not understand
                              this extraordinary procedure; so
                              I presently gave up trying to, and dozed
                              off to sleep. Pretty soon the watchman
                              was back again, and this time he was
                              gruff. I was annoyed. I said:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e342">“What do you want to come bothering
                              around here in the middle of the
                              night for? Now as like as not I 'll not
                              get to sleep again to-night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e345">The watchman said:—</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e348">“Well, if this an't good, I 'm blest.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e351">The “off-watch” was just turning in,
                              and I heard some brutal laughter from
                              them, and such remarks as “Hello,
                              watchman! an't the new cub turned out
                              yet? He 's delicate, likely. Give him
                              some sugar in a rag and send for the
                              chambermaid to sing rock-a-by-baby to
                              him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e354">About this time Mr. B— appeared
                              on the scene. Something like a minute
                              later I was climbing the pilot-house steps
                              with some of my clothes on and the rest
                              in my arms. Mr. B— was close behind,
                              commenting. Here was something fresh—
                              this thing of getting up in the middle
                              of the night to go to work. It was a
                              detail in piloting that had never occurred
                              to me at all. I knew that boats
                              ran all night, but somehow I had never
                              happened to reflect that somebody had
                              to get up out of a warm bed to run
                              them. I began to fear that piloting
                              was not quite so romantic as I had imagined
                              it was; there was something very
                              real and work-like about this new phase
                              of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e358">It was a rather dingy night, although
                              a fair number of stars were out. The
                              big mate was at the wheel, and he had
                              the old tub pointed at a star and was
                              holding her straight up the middle of the
                              river. The shores on either hand were
                              not much more than a mile apart, but
                              they seemed wonderfully far away and
                              ever so vague and indistinct. The mate
                              said :—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e361">“We 've got to land at Jones's plantation, sir.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e364">The vengeful spirit in me exulted. I
                              said to myself, I wish you joy of your
                              job, Mr. B—; you 'll have a good time
                              finding Mr. Jones's plantation such a
                              night as this; and I hope you never 
                              <hi id="d193447e366" style="font-style: italic;">will</hi>
                              find it as long as you live.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e370">Mr. B— said to the mate:</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e373">“Upper end of the plantation, or the
                              lower?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e376">“Upper.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e380">“I can't do it. The stumps there are

                              great distance to the lower, and you 'll
                              have to get along with that.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e385">“All right, sir. If Jones don't like
                              it he 'll have to lump it, I reckon.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e388">And then the mate left. My exultation
                              began to cool and my wonder to
                              come up. Here was a man who not
                              only proposed to find this plantation on
                              such a night, but to find either end of it
                              you preferred. I dreadfully wanted to
                              ask a question, but I was carrying about
                              as many short answers as my cargo-room
                              would admit of, so I held my peace.
                              All I desired to ask Mr. B— was
                              the simple question whether he was ass
                              enough to really imagine he was going
                              to find that plantation on a night when
                              all plantations were exactly alike and all
                              the same color. But I held in. I used
                              to have fine inspirations of prudence in
                              those days.

                           <p id="d193447e391">Mr. B— made for the shore and soon
                              was scraping it, just the same as if it
                              had been daylight. And not only that,
                              but singing—

                              It seemed to me that I had put my life

                              outcast. Presently he turned on me and

                              had to say just what I had said before.

                           <p id="d193447e475">This was a red rag to the bull. He
                              raged and stormed so (he was crossing
                              the river at the time) that I judge it
                              made him blind, because he ran over
                              the steering-oar of a trading-scow. Of
                              course the traders sent up a volley of
                              red-hot profanity. Never was a man
                              so grateful as Mr. B— was: because
                              he was brim full, and here were subjects
                              who would 
                              <hi id="d193447e477" style="font-style: italic;">talk back</hi>. He threw
                              open a window, thrust his head out; and
                              such an irruption followed as I never
                              had heard before. The fainter and farther
                              away the scowmen's curses drifted,
                              the higher Mr. B— lifted his voice
                              and the weightier his adjectives grew.
                              When he closed the window he was
                              empty. You could have drawn a seine
                              through his system and not caught
                              curses enough to disturb your mother
                              with. Presently he said to me in the
                              gentlest way:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e481">“My boy, you must get a little memorandum-book,
                              and every time I tell you
                              a thing, put it down right away. There's
                              only one way to be a pilot, and that is to
                              get this entire river by heart. You have
                              to know it just like A B C.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e484">That was a dismal revelation to me;
                              for my memory was never loaded with
                              anything but blank cartridges. However,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e486"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="8" data-tei-n="220"> </a></span>
                              I did not feel discouraged long. I
                              judged that it was best to make some
                              allowances, for doubtless Mr. B— was
                              “stretching.” Presently he pulled a
                              rope and struck a few strokes on the big
                              bell. The stars were all gone now, and
                              the night was as black as ink. I could
                              hear the wheels churn along the bank,
                              but I was not entirely certain that I
                              could see the shore. The voice of the
                              invisible watchman called up from the
                              hurricane deck:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e490">“What 's this, sir?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e493">“Jones's plantation.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e496">I said to myself, I wish I might
                              venture to offer a small bet that it is n't.
                              But I did not chirp. I only waited to
                              see. Mr. B— handled the engine
                              bells, and in due time the boat's nose
                              came to the land, a torch glowed from
                              the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a
                              darky's voice on the bank said. “Gimme
                              de carpet-bag, Mars' Jones,” and the
                              next moment we were standing up the
                              river again, all serene. I reflected deeply
                              a while, and then said,—but not aloud,
                              —Well, the finding of that plantation
                              was the luckiest accident that ever happened;
                              but it could n't happen again in
                              a hundred years. And I fully believed
                              it 
                              <hi id="d193447e498" style="font-style: italic;">was</hi> an accident, too.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e502">By the time we had gone seven or
                              eight hundred miles up the river, I had
                              learned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream
                              steersman in daylight, and before
                              we reached St. Louis I had made
                              a trifle of progress in night-work, but
                              only a trifle. I had a note-book that
                              fairly bristled with the names of towns,
                              “points,” bars, islands, bends, reaches,
                              etc.: but the information was to be
                              found only in the note-book— none of
                              it was in my head. It made my heart
                              ache to think I had only got half of the
                              river set down; for as our watch was
                              four hours off and four hours on, day
                              and night, there was a long four-hour
                              gap in my book for every time I had
                              slept since the voyage began.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e505">My chief was presently hired to go
                              on a big New Orleans boat, and I packed
                              my satchel and went with him. She
                              was a grand affair. When I stood in
                              her pilot-house I was so far above the
                              water that I seemed perched on a
                              mountain; and her decks stretched so
                              far away, fore and aft, below me, that I
                              wondered how I could ever have considered
                              the little Paul Jones a large craft.
                              There were other differences, too. The
                              Paul Jones's pilot-house was a cheap,
                              dingy, battered rattle-trap, cramped for
                              room: but here was a sumptuous glass
                              temple; room enough to have a dance
                              in; showy red and gold window-curtains;
                              an imposing sofa; leather cushions and
                              a back to the high bench where visiting
                              pilots sit, to spin yarns and “look at the
                              river;” bright, fanciful “cuspadores”
                              instead of a broad wooden box filled
                              with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth on the
                              floor; a hospitable big stove for winter;
                              a wheel as high as my head, costly with
                              inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright
                              brass knobs for the bells; and a tidy,
                              white-aproned, black “texas-tender,”
                              to bring up tarts and ices and coffee
                              during mid-watch, day and night. Now
                              this was “something like;” and so I
                              began to take heart once more to believe
                              that piloting was a romantic sort
                              of occupation after all. The moment
                              we were under way I began to prowl
                              about the great steamer and fill myself
                              with joy. She was as clean and as dainty
                              as a drawing-room; when I looked
                              down her long, gilded saloon, it was like
                              gazing through a splendid tunnel; she
                              had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter,
                              on every state-room door; she
                              glittered with no end of prism-fringed
                              chandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant,
                              the bar was marvelous, and the
                              bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered
                              at incredible cost. The boiler
                              deck (
                              <hi id="d193447e507" style="font-style: italic;">i. e.</hi>, the second story of the boat,
                              so to speak) was as spacious as a church,
                              it seemed to me; so with the forecastle;
                              and there was no pitiful handful of deck-hands,
                              firemen, and roust-abouts down
                              there, but a whole battalion of men.
                              The fires were fiercely glaring from a
                              long row of furnaces, and over them
                              were eight huge boilers! This was unutterable
                              pomp. The mighty engines—
                              but enough of this. I had never felt so
                              fine before. And when I found that the
                              regiment of natty servants respectfully
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e510"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="221"> </a></span>
                              “sir'd” me, my satisfaction was complete.

                           <p id="d193447e513">When I returned to the pilot-house
                              St. Louis was gone and I was lost.
                              Here was a piece of river which was all
                              down in my book, but I could make
                              neither head nor tail of it: you understand,
                              it was turned around. I had seen
                              it, when coming up-stream, but I had
                              never faced about to see how it looked
                              when it was behind me. My heart broke
                              again, for it was plain that I had got to
                              learn this troublesome river 
                              <hi id="d193447e515" style="font-style: italic;">both ways</hi>.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e520">The pilot-house was full of pilots,
                              going down to “look at the river.”
                              What is called the “upper river” (the
                              two hundred miles between St. Louis
                              and Cairo, where the Ohio comes in)
                              was low; and the Mississippi changes
                              its channel so constantly that the pilots
                              used to always find it necessary to run
                              down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when
                              their boats were to lie in port a week,
                              that is, when the water was at a low
                              stage. A deal of this “looking at the
                              river” was done by poor fellows who
                              seldom had a berth, and whose only
                              hope of getting one lay in their being
                              always freshly posted and therefore
                              ready to drop into the shoes of some
                              reputable pilot, for a single trip, on
                              account of such pilot's sudden illness,
                              or some other necessity. And a good
                              many of them constantly ran up and
                              down inspecting the river, not because
                              they ever really hoped to get a berth,
                              but because (they being guests of the
                              boat) it was cheaper to “look at the
                              river” than stay ashore and pay board.
                              In time these fellows grew dainty in
                              their tastes, and only infested boats that
                              had an established reputation for setting
                              good tables. All visiting pilots were
                              useful, for they were always ready and
                              willing, winter or summer, night or day,
                              to go out in the yawl and help buoy the
                              channel or assist the boat's pilots in any
                              way they could. They were likewise
                              welcome because all pilots are tireless
                              talkers, when gathered together, and as
                              they talk only about the river they are
                              always understood and are always interesting.
                              Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the
                              river, and his pride in his occupation
                              surpasses the pride of kings.

                           <p id="d193447e523">We had a fine company of these 
                              river-inspectors along, this trip. There
                              were eight or ten; and there was abundance
                              of room for them in our great
                              pilot-house. Two or three of them wore
                              polished silk hats, elaborate shirt-fronts,
                              diamond breastpins, kid gloves, and
                              patent-leather boots. They were choice
                              in their English, and bore themselves
                              with a dignity proper to men of solid
                              means and prodigious reputation as
                              pilots. The others were more or less
                              loosely clad, and wore upon their heads
                              tall felt cones that were suggestive of
                              the days of the Commonwealth.

                           <p id="d193447e526">I was a cipher in this august company,
                              and felt subdued, not to say
                              torpid. I was not even of sufficient
                              consequence to assist at the wheel when
                              it was necessary to put the tiller hard
                              down in a hurry; the guest that stood
                              nearest did that when occasion required—
                              and this was pretty much all the
                              time, because of the crookedness of the
                              channel and the scant water. I stood
                              in a corner; and the talk I listened to
                              took the hope all out of me. One visitor
                              said to another:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e529">“Jim, how did you run Plum Point,

                           <p id="d193447e532">“It was in the night, there, and I
                              ran it the way one of the boys on the
                              Diana told me; started out about fifty
                              yards above the wood pile on the false
                              point, and held on the cabin under
                              Plum Point till I raised the reef quarter
                              less twain—then straightened up
                              for the middle bar till I got well abreast
                              the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the
                              bend, then got my stern on the cotton-wood
                              and head on the low place above
                              the point, and came through a-booming

                              second reef abreast the big snag in the
                              bend, and had quarter less twain.”

                              water for Plum Point, it seems to me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e553">There was an approving nod all around
                              as this quiet snub dropped on the boaster
                              and “settled” him. And so they went
                              on talk-talk-talking. Meantime, the
                              thing that was running in my mind was,
                              “Now if my ears hear aright, I have
                              not only to get the names of all the
                              towns and islands and bends, and so on,
                              by heart, but I must even get up a warm
                              personal acquaintanceship with every
                              old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood and
                              obscure wood pile that ornaments the
                              banks of this river for twelve hundred
                              miles; and more than that, I must actually
                              know where these things are in the
                              dark, unless these guests are gifted with
                              eyes that can pierce through two miles
                              of solid blackness; I wish the piloting
                              business was in Jericho and I had never
                              thought of it.”

                           <p id="d193447e557">At dusk Mr. B— tapped the big
                              bell three times (the signal to land), and
                              the captain emerged from his drawing-room
                              in the forward end of the texas,
                              and looked up inquiringly. Mr. B—
                              said:—

                              shore and was tied up for the night. It
                              seemed to me a fine thing that the pilot
                              could do as he pleased without asking so
                              grand a captain's permission. I took
                              my supper and went immediately to bed,
                              discouraged by my day's observations
                              and experiences. My late voyage's
                              note-booking was but a confusion of
                              meaningless names. It had tangled me
                              all up in a knot every time I had looked
                              at it in the daytime. I now hoped for
                              respite in sleep; but no, it reveled all
                              through my head till sunrise again, a
                              frantic and tireless nightmare.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e569">Next morning I felt pretty rusty and
                              low-spirited. We went booming along,
                              taking a good many chances, for we
                              were anxious to “get out of the river”
                              (as getting out to Cairo was called) before
                              night should overtake us. But
                              Mr. B—'s partner, the other pilot,
                              presently grounded the boat, and we
                              lost so much time getting her off that
                              it was plain the darkness would overtake
                              us a good long way above the
                              mouth. This was a great misfortune,
                              especially to certain of our visiting pilots,
                              whose boats would have to wait for their
                              return, no matter how long that might
                              be. It sobered the pilot-house talk a
                              good deal. Coming up-stream, pilots
                              did not mind low water or any kind of
                              darkness: nothing stopped them but
                              fog. But down-stream work was different;
                              a boat was too nearly helpless, with
                              a stiff current pushing behind her; so it
                              was not customary to run down-stream
                              at night in low water.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e572">There seemed to be one small hope,
                              however: if we could get through the
                              intricate and dangerous Hat Island
                              crossing before night, we could venture
                              the rest, for we would have plainer sailing
                              and better water. But it would be
                              insanity to attempt Hat Island at night.
                              So there was a deal of looking at watches
                              all the rest of the day, and a constant
                              ciphering upon the speed we were making;
                              Hat Island was the eternal subject;
                              sometimes hope was high and sometimes
                              we were delayed in a bad crossing, and
                              down it went again. For hours all
                              hands lay under the burden of this suppressed
                              excitement; it was even communicated
                              to me, and I got to feeling so
                              solicitous about Hat Island, and under
                              such an awful pressure of responsibility,
                              that I wished I might have five minutes
                              on shore to draw a good, full, relieving
                              breath, and start over again. We were
                              standing no regular watches. Each of
                              our pilots ran such portions of the river
                              as he had run when coming up-stream,
                              because of his greater familiarity with
                              it; but both remained in the pilot-house
                              constantly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e576">An hour before sunset, Mr. B—
                              took the wheel and Mr. W— stepped
                              aside. For the next thirty minutes
                              every man held his watch in his hand
                              and was restless, silent, and uneasy. At
                              last somebody said, with a doomful sigh.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e579">“Well, yonder 's Hat Island—and
                              we can't make it.”
                           </p>

                           <p id="d193447e584">All the watches closed with a snap,
                              everybody sighed and muttered something
                              about its being “too bad, too
                              bad—ah, if we could 
                              <hi id="d193447e586" style="font-style: italic;">only</hi> have got
                              here half an hour sooner!” and the
                              place was thick with the atmosphere of
                              disappointment. Some started to go
                              out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap
                              to land. The sun dipped behind the
                              horizon, the boat went on. Inquiring
                              looks passed from one guest to another;
                              and one who had his hand on the doorknob,
                              and had turned it, waited, then
                              presently took away his hand and let
                              the knob turn back again. We bore
                              steadily down the bend. More looks
                              were exchanged, and nods of surprised
                              admiration—but no words. Insensibly
                              the men drew together behind Mr. B—
                              as the sky darkened and one or
                              two dim stars came out. The dead
                              silence and sense of waiting became oppressive.
                              Mr. B— pulled the cord,
                              and two deep, mellow notes from the big
                              bell floated off on the night. Then a
                              pause, and one more note was struck.
                              The watchman's voice followed, from
                              the hurricane deck:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e590">“Labboard lead, there! Stabboard
                              lead!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e593">The cries of the leadsmen began to
                              rise out of the distance, and were gruffly
                              repeated by the word-passers on the
                              hurricane deck.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e597">“M-a-r-k three! M-a-r-k three!

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e600">Mr. B— pulled two bell-ropes, and
                              was answered by faint jinglings far below
                              in the engine-room, and our speed
                              slackened. The steam began to whistle
                              through the gauge-cocks. The cries of
                              the leadsmen went on—and it is a weird
                              sound, always, in the night. Every pilot
                              in the lot was watching, now, with fixed
                              eyes, and talking under his breath. Nobody
                              was calm and easy but Mr. B—.
                              He would put his wheel down and stand
                              on a spoke, and as the steamer swung
                              into her (to me) utterly invisible marks
                              —for we seemed to be in the midst of a
                              wide and gloomy sea—he would meet
                              and fasten her there. Talk was going
                              on, now, in low voices:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e603">“There; she 's over the first reef
                              all right!”

                           <p id="d193447e606">After a pause, another subdued voice:</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e609">“Her stern 's coming down just

                              right, by

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e618">Somebody else muttered:—</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e622">“Oh, it was done beautiful—
                              <hi id="d193447e624" style="font-style: italic;">beautiful!</hi>”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e628">Now the engines were stopped altogether,
                              and we drifted with the current.
                              Not that I could see the boat drift, for
                              I could not, the stars being all gone by
                              this time. This drifting was the dismalest
                              work; it held one's heart still.
                              Presently I discovered a blacker gloom
                              than that which surrounded us. It was
                              the head of the island. We were closing
                              right down upon it. We entered
                              its deeper shadow, and so imminent
                              seemed the peril that I was likely to
                              suffocate; and I had the strongest impulse
                              to do 
                              <hi id="d193447e630" style="font-style: italic;">something</hi>, anything, to save
                              the vessel. But still Mr. B— stood
                              by his wheel, silent, intent as a cat,
                              and all the pilots stood shoulder to
                              shoulder at his back.

                           <p id="d193447e634">“She 'll not make it!” somebody
                              whispered.

                              to his partner, “Put her hard down!
                              snatch her! snatch her!” The boat
                              rasped and ground her way through the
                              sand, hung upon the apex of disaster
                              a single tremendous instant, and then
                              over she went! And such a shout as
                              went up at Mr. B—'s back never
                              loosened the roof of a pilot-house before!

                              it was some little time, too, before his

                              while, I had managed to pack my head
                              full of islands, towns, bars, “points,”
                              and bends; and a curiously inanimate
                              mass of lumber it was, too. However,
                              inasmuch as I could shut my eyes and
                              reel off a good long string of these
                              names without leaving out more than
                              ten miles of river in every fifty, I began
                              to feel that I could take a boat
                              down to New Orleans if I could make
                              her skip those little gaps. But of course
                              my complacency could hardly get start
                              enough to lift my nose a trifle into the
                              air, before Mr. B— would think of
                              something to fetch it down again. One
                              day he turned on me suddenly with this
                              settler:—
                           </p>

                           <p id="d193447e707">He might as well have asked me my

                              I reflected respectfully, and then said I
                              did n't know it had any particular shape.
                              My gunpowdery chief went off with a
                              bang, of course, and then went on loading
                              and firing until he was out of adjectives.

                              a very placable and even remorseful

                              all gone. That word “old” is merely
                              affectionate; he was not more than
                              thirty-four. I waited. By and by he

                              where it is, and the shape of the river
                              tells you when you are coming to it.

                              dark night from what it is on a starlight
                              night. All shores seem to be straight

                              makes way for you. Then there 's your

                              were leagues of shore changing shape.
                              My spirits were down in the mud again.
                              Two things seemed pretty apparent to
                              me. One was, that in order to be a
                              pilot a man had got to learn more than
                              any one man ought to be allowed to
                              know; and the other was, that he must
                              learn it all over again in a different way
                              every twenty-four hours.

                           <p id="d193447e793">That night we had the watch until
                              twelve. Now it was an ancient river
                              custom for the two pilots to chat a bit
                              when the watch changed. While the
                              relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit
                              his cigar, his partner, the retiring pilot,
                              would say something like this:—

                              mention that we were in such-and-such

                              a man's wood-yard or plantation.
                              This was courtesy; I supposed it
                              was

                              particular night—a tremendous breach
                              of etiquette; in fact, it is the unpardonable
                              sin among pilots. So Mr. B— 
                              gave him no greeting whatever, but simply
                              surrendered the wheel and marched
                              out of the pilot-house without a word.
                              I was appalled; it was a villainous night
                              for blackness, we were in a particularly
                              wide and blind part of the river,
                              where there was no shape or substance
                              to anything, and it seemed incredible
                              that Mr. B— should have left that
                              poor fellow to kill the boat trying to

                              find out where he was. But I resolved
                              that I would stand by him any way.
                              He should find that he was not wholly
                              friendless. So I stood around, and
                              waited to be asked where we were.
                              But Mr. W— plunged on serenely
                              through the solid firmament of black
                              cats that stood for an atmosphere, and
                              never opened his mouth. Here is a
                              proud devil, thought I; here is a limb
                              of Satan that would rather send us all
                              to destruction than put himself under
                              obligations to me, because I am not yet
                              one of the salt of the earth and privileged
                              to snub captains and lord it over
                              everything dead and alive in a steamboat.
                              I presently climbed up on the
                              bench; I did not think it was safe to
                              go to sleep while this lunatic was on
                              watch.

                              of window-sash and stuff.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e866">I was glad this damage had been
                              saved, for it would have made me unpopular
                              with the owners. They always
                              hated anybody who had the name of
                              being careless, and injuring things.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e869">I went to work, now, to learn the
                              shape of the river; and of all the eluding
                              and ungraspable objects that ever I
                              tried to get mind or hands on, that was
                              the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon
                              a sharp, wooded point that projected far
                              into the river some miles ahead of me,
                              and go to laboriously photographing its
                              shape upon my brain; and just as I was
                              beginning to succeed to my satisfaction,
                              we would draw up toward it and the
                              exasperating thing would begin to melt
                              away and fold back into the bank! If
                              there had been a conspicuous dead tree
                              standing upon the very point of the
                              cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously
                              merged into the general forest,
                              and occupying the middle of a straight
                              shore, when I got abreast of it! No
                              prominent hill would stick to its shape
                              long enough for me to make up my
                              mind what its form really was, but it
                              was as dissolving and changeful as if it
                              had been a mountain of butter in the hottest
                              corner of the tropics. Nothing ever
                              had the same shape when I was coming
                              down-stream that it had borne when I
                              went up. I mentioned these little difficulties
                              to Mr. B—. He said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e873">“That 's the very main virtue of the
                              thing. If the shapes did n't change
                              every three seconds they would n't be
                              of any use. Take this place where we
                              are now, for instance. As long as that
                              hill over yonder is only one hill, I can
                              boom right along the way I 'm going;
                              but the moment it splits at the top and
                              forms a V, I know I 've got to scratch
                              to starboard in a hurry, or I 'll bang
                              this boat's brains out against a rock;
                              and then the moment one of the prongs
                              of the V swings behind the other, I 've
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e875"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="16" data-tei-n="286"> </a></span>
                              got to waltz to larboard again, or I 'll
                              have a misunderstanding with a snag
                              that would snatch the keelson out of this
                              steamboat as neatly as if it were a sliver
                              in your hand. If that hill did n't change
                              its shape on bad nights there would be
                              an awful steamboat grave-yard around
                              here inside of a year.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e878">It was plain that I had got to learn
                              the shape of the river in all the different
                              ways that could be thought of,—upside
                              down, wrong end first, inside out, fore-and-aft,
                              and “thortships,” and then
                              know what to do on gray nights when it
                              had n't any shape at all. So I set about
                              it. In the course of time I began to
                              get the best of this knotty lesson, and
                              my self-complacency moved to the front
                              once more. Mr. B— was all fixed,
                              and ready to start it to the rear again.
                              He opened on me after this fashion:—

                              the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall,
                              trip before last?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e884">I considered this an outrage. I said:</p>

                              stretch. How do you reckon I can remember
                              such a mess as that?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e890">“My boy, you 've got to remember
                              it. You 've got to remember the exact
                              spot and the exact marks the boat lay
                              in when we had the shoalest water, in
                              every one of the two thousand shoal
                              places between St. Louis and New Orleans;
                              and you must n't get the shoal
                              soundings and marks of one trip mixed
                              up with the shoal soundings and marks
                              of another, either, for they 're not often
                              twice alike. You must keep them separate.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e894">When I came to myself again, I
                              said,—

                              I won't have to pilot a steamboat in
                              order to make a living. I want to retire
                              from this business. I want a slush-bucket
                              and a brush; I 'm only fit for a

                              to be a pilot; and if I had I would n't

                              person like this. I promptly put such a
                              strain on my memory that by and by
                              even the shoal water and the countless
                              crossing-marks began to stay with me.
                              But the result was just the same. I
                              never could more than get one knotty
                              thing learned before another presented
                              itself. Now I had often seen pilots gazing
                              at the water and pretending to read
                              it as if it were a book; but it was a book
                              that told me nothing. A time came at
                              last, however, when Mr. B— seemed
                              to think me far enough advanced to hear
                              a lesson on water-reading. So he began:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e915">“Do you see that long slanting line
                              on the face of the water? Now that 's
                              a reef. Moreover, it 's a bluff reef.
                              There is a solid sand-bar under it that
                              is nearly as straight up and down as the
                              side of a house. There is plenty of
                              water close up to it, but mighty little on
                              top of it. If you were to hit it you
                              would knock the boat's brains out. Do
                              you see where the line fringes out at
                              the upper end and begins to fade
                              away?”

                              the head of the reef. You can climb
                              over there, and not hurt anything.
                              Cross over, now, and follow along close
                              under the reef—easy water there—
                              not much current.”

                           <p id="d193447e925">I followed the reef along till I approached
                              the fringed end. Then Mr. B— said,—

                              the reef; a boat hates shoal water.
                              Stand by—wait—wait—keep her
                              well in hand.

                           <p id="d193447e934">He seized the other side of the wheel
                              and helped to spin it around until it was

                              boat resisted and refused to answer for
                              a while, and next she came surging to

                              she fights strong and the tiller slips a
                              little, in a jerky, greasy sort of way, let
                              up on her a trifle; it is the way she
                              tells you at night that the water is too
                              shoal; but keep edging her up, little
                              by little, toward the point. You are
                              well up on the bar, now; there is a bar
                              under every point, because the water
                              that comes down around it forms an
                              eddy and allows the sediment to sink.
                              Do you see those fine lines on the face
                              of the water that branch out like the
                              ribs of a fan? Well, those are little
                              reefs; you want to just miss the ends of
                              them, but run them pretty close. Now
                              look out—look out! Don't you crowd
                              that slick, greasy-looking place; there
                              ain't nine feet there; she won't stand
                              it. She begins to smell it; look sharp,
                              I tell you! Oh blazes, there you go!
                              Stop the starboard wheel! Quick! Ship
                              up to back! Set her back!”

                              engines answered promptly, shooting white
                              columns of steam far aloft out of the
                              scape pipes, but it was too late. The
                              boat had “smelt” the bar in good earnest;
                              the foamy ridges that radiated from
                              her bows suddenly disappeared, a great
                              dead swell came rolling forward and
                              swept ahead of her, she careened far
                              over to larboard, and went tearing away
                              toward the other shore as if she were
                              about scared to death. We were a good
                              mile from where we ought to have been,
                              when we finally got the upper hand of
                              her again.

                              when I rounded it and entered upon a
                              piece of river which I had some misgivings
                              about. I did not know that he
                              was hiding behind a chimney to see
                              how I would perform. I went gayly
                              along, getting prouder and prouder, for
                              he had never left the boat in my sole
                              charge such a length of time before. I
                              even got to “setting” her and letting
                              the wheel go, entirely, while I vaingloriously
                              turned my back and inspected
                              the stern marks and hummed a tune,
                              a sort of easy indifference which I had
                              prodigiously admired in B— and other
                              great pilots. Once I inspected rather
                              long, and when I faced to the front
                              again my heart flew into my mouth so
                              suddenly that if I had n't clapped my
                              teeth together I would have lost it. One
                              of those frightful bluff reefs was stretching
                              its deadly length right across our
                              bows! My head was gone in a moment;
                              I did not know which end I stood on; I
                              gasped and could not get my breath; I
                              spun the wheel down with such rapidity
                              that it wove itself together like a
                              spider's web; the boat answered and
                              turned square away from the reef, but
                              the reef followed her! I fled, and still
                              it followed—still it kept right across
                              my bows! I never looked to see where
                              I was going, I only fled. The awful
                              crash was imminent—why did n't that
                              villain come! If I committed the crime
                              of ringing a bell, I might get thrown
                              overboard. But better that than kill
                              the boat. So in blind desperation I
                              started such a rattling “shivaree”
                              down below as never had astounded an
                              engineer in this world before, I fancy.
                              Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines
                              began to back and fill in a furious
                              way, and my reason forsook its throne
                              —we were about to crash into the woods
                              on the other side of the river. Just
                              then Mr. B— stepped calmly into
                              view on the hurricane deck. My soul
                              went out to him in gratitude. My distress
                              vanished; I would have felt safe
                              on the brink of Niagara, with Mr. B—  
                              on the hurricane deck. He blandly and
                              sweetly took his tooth-pick out of his
                              mouth between his fingers, as if it were
                              a cigar,—we were just in the act of
                              climbing an overhanging big tree, and
                              the passengers were scudding astern

                              like rats,—and lifted up these commands

                              be able to explain why or how you know

                           <p id="d193447e1030">It turned out to be true. The face of
                              the water, in time, became a wonderful
                              book—a book that was a dead language
                              to the uneducated passenger, but which
                              told its mind to me without reserve, delivering
                              its most cherished secrets as
                              clearly as if it uttered them with a voice.
                              And it was not a book to be read once
                              and thrown aside, for it had a new story
                              to tell every day. Throughout the long
                              twelve hundred miles there was never
                              a page that was void of interest, never
                              one that you could leave unread without
                              loss, never one that you would want to
                              skip, thinking you could find higher enjoyment
                              in some other thing. There
                              never was so wonderful a book written
                              by man; never one whose interest was
                              so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparklingly
                              renewed with every re-perusal.
                              The passenger who could not read it
                              was charmed with a peculiar sort of
                              faint dimple on its surface (on the rare
                              occasions when he did not overlook it
                              altogether); but to the pilot that was an
                              
                              <hi id="d193447e1032" style="font-style: italic;">italicized</hi> passage; indeed, it was more
                              than that, it was a legend of the largest
                              capitals with a string of shouting exclamation
                              points at the end of it; for it
                              meant that a wreck or a rock was buried
                              there that could tear the life out of the
                              strongest vessel that ever floated. It is
                              the faintest and simplest expression the
                              water ever makes, and the most hideous
                              to a pilot's eye. In truth, the passenger
                              who could not read this book saw nothing
                              but all manner of pretty pictures in
                              it, painted by the sun and shaded by the
                              clouds, whereas to the trained eye these
                              were not pictures at all, but the grimmest
                              and most dead-earnest of reading-matter.

                           <p id="d193447e1036">Now when I had mastered the language
                              of this water and had come to
                              know every trifling feature that bordered
                              the great river as familiarly as I knew

                              the letters of the alphabet, I had made
                              a valuable acquisition. But I had lost
                              something, too. I had lost something
                              which could never be restored to me
                              while I lived. All the grace, the beauty,
                              the poetry had gone out of the majestic
                              river! I still keep in mind a
                              certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed
                              when steamboating was new to
                              me. A broad expanse of the river was
                              turned to blood; in the middle distance
                              the red hue brightened into gold, through
                              which a solitary log came floating, black
                              and conspicuous; in one place a long,
                              slanting mark lay sparkling upon the
                              water; in another the surface was broken
                              by boiling, tumbling rings, that were
                              as many-tinted as an opal; where the
                              ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth
                              spot that was covered with graceful
                              circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately
                              traced; the shore on our left was
                              densely wooded, and the sombre shadow
                              that fell from this forest was broken in
                              one place by a long, ruffled trail that
                              shone like silver; and high above the
                              forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree
                              waved a single leafy bough that glowed
                              like a flame in the unobstructed splendor
                              that was flowing from the sun. There
                              were graceful curves, reflected images,
                              woody heights, soft distances; and over
                              the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving
                              lights drifted steadily, enriching
                              it, every passing moment, with new marvels
                              of coloring.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1041">I stood like one bewitched. I drank
                              it in, in a speechless rapture. The world
                              was new to me, and I had never seen
                              anything like this at home. But as I
                              have said, a day came when I began
                              to cease noting the glories and the
                              charms which the moon and the sun and
                              the twilight wrought upon the river's
                              face; another day came when I ceased
                              altogether to note them. Then, if that
                              sunset scene had been repeated, I would
                              have looked upon it without rapture,
                              and would have commented upon it,
                              inwardly, after this fashion: This sun
                              means that we are going to have wind
                              to-morrow: that floating log means that
                              the river is rising, small thanks to it;
                              that slanting mark on the water refers to
                              a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody's
                              steamboat one of these nights, if
                              it keeps on stretching out like that; those
                              tumbling “boils” show a dissolving bar
                              and a changing channel there; the lines
                              and circles in the slick water over yonder
                              are a warning that that execrable
                              place is shoaling up dangerously; that
                              silver streak in the shadow of the forest
                              is the “break” from a new snag, and
                              he has located himself in the very best
                              place he could have found to fish for
                              steamboats; that tall, dead tree, with a
                              single living branch, is not going to last
                              long, and then how is a body ever going
                              to get through this blind place at night
                              without the friendly old landmark?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1044">No, the romance and the beauty were
                              all gone from the river. All the value
                              any feature of it had for me now was
                              the amount of usefulness it could furnish
                              toward compassing the safe piloting of
                              a steamboat. Since those days, I have
                              pitied doctors from my heart. What
                              does the lovely flush in a beauty's cheek
                              mean to a doctor but a “break” that
                              ripples above some deadly disease?
                              Are not all her visible charms sown
                              thick with what are to him the signs and
                              symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever
                              see her beauty at all, or does n't he simply
                              view her professionally, and comment
                              upon her unwholesome condition
                              all to himself? And does n't he sometimes
                              wonder whether he has gained
                              most or lost most by learning his trade?

                              to read my chapters which have preceded 
                              this may possibly wonder that I
                              deal so minutely with piloting as a science.
                              It was the prime purpose of these
                              articles; and I am not quite done yet.
                              I wish to show, in the most patient and
                              painstaking way, what a wonderful science
                              it is. Ship channels are buoyed
                              and lighted, and therefore it is a comparatively
                              easy undertaking to learn to
                              run them; clear-water rivers, with gravel
                              bottoms, change their channels very
                              gradually, and therefore one needs to
                              learn them but once; but piloting becomes
                              another matter when you apply it
                              to vast streams like the Mississippi and
                              the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave
                              and change constantly, whose snags are
                              always hunting up new quarters, whose
                              sand-bars are never at rest, whose channels
                              are forever dodging and shirking,
                              and whose obstructions must be confronted
                              in all nights and all weathers without
                              the aid of a single light-house or a single
                              buoy; for there is neither light nor
                              buoy to be found anywhere in all this
                              three or four thousand miles of villainous
                              river. I feel justified in enlarging
                              upon this great science for the reason
                              that I feel sure no one has ever yet
                              written a paragraph about it who had
                              piloted a steamboat himself, and so had
                              a practical knowledge of the subject.
                              If the theme were hackneyed, I should
                              be obliged to deal gently with the reader;
                              but since it is wholly new, I have
                              felt at liberty to take up a considerable
                              degree of room with it.

                              river; when I had so mastered its shape
                              that I could shut my eyes and trace it
                              from St. Louis to New Orleans; when I
                              had learned to read the face of the water
                              as one would cull the news from the
                              morning paper; and finally, when I had
                              trained my dull memory to treasure up
                              an endless array of soundings and 
                              crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them,
                              I judged that my education was complete:
                              so I got to tilting my cap to the

                              in my mouth at the wheel. Mr.
                              B— had his eye on these airs. One

                              —tells you whether there 's more water

                              Now here; do you see this narrow belt

                              while the water was higher. You see

                              The bank helps in other ways. Do you

                              shapes and all—and so I can run it at
                              night?”

                           <p id="d193447e1211">“Yes. And you 've got to have good
                              fair marks from one end of the river to
                              the other, that will help the bank tell you
                              when there is water enough in each of
                              these countless places,—like that stump,
                              you know. When the river first begins
                              to rise, you can run half a dozen of the
                              deepest of them; when it rises a foot
                              more you can run another dozen; the
                              next foot will add a couple of dozen, and
                              so on: so you see you have to know your
                              banks and marks to a dead moral certainty,
                              and never get them mixed; for
                              when you start through one of those
                              cracks, there 's no backing out again, as
                              there is in the big river; you 've got to
                              go through, or stay there six months if
                              you get caught on a falling river. There
                              are about fifty of these cracks which you
                              can't run at all except when the river is
                              brim full and over the banks.”

                              I 've just told you; when you start into
                              one of those places you 've got to go
                              through. They are too narrow to turn
                              around in, too crooked to back out of,
                              and the shoal water is always 
                              <hi id="d193447e1222" style="font-style: italic;">up at the

                              of them is always likely to be filling up,
                              little by little, so that the marks you reckon
                              their depth by, this season, may not
                              answer for next.”

                           <p id="d193447e1232">The next few months showed me
                              strange things. On the same day that
                              we held the conversation above narrated,
                              we met a great rise coming down the
                              river. The whole vast face of the stream
                              was black with drifting dead logs, broken
                              boughs, and great trees that had caved
                              in and been washed away. It required
                              the nicest steering to pick one's way
                              through this rushing raft, even in the
                              day-time, when crossing from point to
                              point; and at night the difficulty was
                              mightily increased; every now and then
                              a huge log, lying deep in the water,
                              would suddenly appear right under our
                              bows, coming head-on; no use to try to
                              avoid it then; we could only stop the
                              engines, and one wheel would walk over
                              that log from one end to the other, keeping
                              up a thundering racket and careening
                              the boat in a way that was very 
                              uncomfortable to passengers. Now and
                              then we would hit one of these sunken
                              logs a rattling bang, dead in the centre,
                              with a full head of steam, and it would
                              stun the boat as if she bad hit a continent.
                              Sometimes this log would lodge
                              and stay right across our nose, and back
                              the Mississippi up before it; we would
                              have to do a little craw-fishing, then, to
                              get away from the obstruction. We
                              often hit 
                              <hi id="d193447e1234" style="font-style: italic;">white</hi> logs, in the dark, for we
                              could not see them till we were right on
                              them; but a black log is a pretty distinct
                              object at night. A white snag is an ugly
                              customer when the daylight is gone.
                              Of course, on the great rise, down
                              came a swarm of prodigious timber-rafts
                              from the head waters of the Mississippi,
                              coat barges from Pittsburgh, little trading
                              scows from everywhere, and broadhorns
                              from “Posey County,” Indiana,
                              freighted with “fruit and furniture”—
                              the usual term for describing it, though
                              in plain English the freight thus aggrandized
                              was hoop-poles and pumpkins.
                              Pilots bore a mortal hatred to these
                              craft; and it was returned with usury.
                              The law required all such helpless traders
                              to keep a light burning, but it was
                              a law that was often broken. All of a
                              sudden, on a murky night, a light would
                              hop up, right under our bows, almost,
                              and an agonized voice, with the backwoods
                              “whang” to it, would wail out:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1238">“Whar 'n the — you goin' to!
                              Cain't you see nothin', you dash-dashed,
                              aig-suckin', sheep-stealin', one-eyed son
                              of a stuffed monkey!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1241">Then for an instant, as we whistled
                              by, the red glare from our furnaces would
                              reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating
                              orator as if under a lightning-flash,
                              and in that instant our firemen and
                              deck-hands would send and receive a
                              tempest of missiles and profanity, one of
                              our wheels would walk off with the crashing
                              fragments of a steering-oar, and down
                              the dead blackness would shut again.
                              And that flatboatman would be sure to
                              go into New Orleans and sue our boat,
                              swearing stoutly that he had a light
                              burning all the time, when in truth his
                              gang had the lantern down below to
                              sing and lie and drink and gamble by,
                              and no watch on deck. Once, at night,
                              in one of those forest-bordered crevices
                              (behind an island) which steamboatmen
                              intensely describe with the phrase “as
                              dark as the inside of a cow,” we should
                              have eaten up a Posey County family,
                              fruit, furniture, and all, but that they
                              happened to be fiddling down below and
                              we just caught the sound of the music
                              in time to sheer off, doing no serious
                              damage, unfortunately, but coming so
                              near it that we had good hopes for a
                              moment. These people brought up their
                              lantern, then, of course; and as we backed
                              and filled to get away, the precious family
                              stood in the light of it—both sexes
                              and various ages—and cursed us till
                              everything turned blue. Once a coalboatman
                              sent a bullet through our pilothouse
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1243"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="449"> </a></span>
                              when we borrowed a steering-oar
                              of him, in a very narrow place.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1247">During this big rise these small-fry
                              craft were an intolerable nuisance. We
                              were running chute after chute, a new
                              world to me,—and if there was a particularly
                              cramped place in a chute, we
                              would be pretty sure to meet a broadhorn
                              there; and if he failed to be there,
                              we would find him in a still worse locality,
                              namely, the head of the chute,
                              on the shoal water. And then there
                              would be no end of profane cordialities
                              exchanged.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1250">Sometimes, in the big river, when we
                              would be feeling our way cautiously along
                              through a fog, the deep hush would suddenly
                              be broken by yells and a clamor of
                              tin pans, and all in an instant a log raft
                              would appear vaguely through the webby
                              veil, close upon us; and then we did not
                              wait to swap knives, but snatched our engine
                              bells out by the roots and piled on
                              all the steam we had, to scramble out of
                              the way! One does n't hit a rock or a
                              solid log raft with a steamboat when he
                              can get excused.

                           <p id="d193447e1253">You will hardly believe it, but many
                              steamboat clerks always carried a large
                              assortment of religious tracts with them
                              in those old departed steamboating days.
                              Indeed they did. Twenty times a day
                              we would be cramping up around a bar,
                              while a string of these small-fry rascals
                              were drifting down into the head of the
                              bend away above and beyond us a couple
                              of miles. Now a skiff would dart away
                              from one of them and come fighting its
                              laborious way across the desert of water.
                              It would “ease all,” in the shadow of
                              our forecastle, and the panting oarsmen
                              would shout, “Gimme a pa-a-per!” as
                              the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The
                              clerk would throw over a file of New
                              Orleans journals. If these were picked
                              up 
                              <hi id="d193447e1255" style="font-style: italic;">without comment</hi>, you might notice
                              that now a dozen other skiffs had been
                              drifting down upon us without saying
                              anything. You understand, they had
                              been waiting to see how No. 1 was going
                              to fare. No. 1 making no comment, all
                              the rest would bend to their oars and
                              come on, now; and as fast as they came
                              the clerk would heave over neat bundles
                              of religious tracts tied to shingles. The
                              amount of hard swearing which twelve
                              packages of religious literature will command
                              when impartially divided up among
                              twelve raftsmen's crews, who have pulled
                              a heavy skiff two miles on a hot day to
                              get them, is simply incredible
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1259">As I have said, the big rise brought
                              a new world under my vision. By the
                              time the river was over its banks we had
                              forsaken our old paths and were hourly
                              climbing over bars that had stood ten
                              feet out of water before; we were shaving
                              stumpy shores, like that at the foot
                              of Madrid Bend, which I had always
                              seen avoided before; we were clattering
                              through chutes like that of 82, where
                              the opening at the foot was an unbroken
                              wall of timber till our nose was almost
                              at the very spot. Some of these chutes
                              were utter solitudes. The dense, untouched
                              forest overhung both banks of
                              the crooked little crack, and one could
                              believe that human creatures had never
                              intruded there before. The swinging
                              grape-vines, the grassy nooks and vistas
                              glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering
                              creepers waving their red blossoms
                              from the tops of dead trunks, and all the
                              spendthrift richness of the forest foliage,
                              were wasted and thrown away there.
                              The chutes were lovely places to steer in;
                              they were deep, except at the head; the
                              current was gentle; under the “points”
                              the water was absolutely dead, and the
                              invisible banks so bluff that where the
                              tender willow thickets projected you
                              could bury your boat's broadside in them
                              as you tore along, and then you seemed
                              fairly to fly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1262">Behind other islands we found wretched
                              little farms, and wretcheder little
                              log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences
                              sticking a foot or two above the water,
                              with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked,
                              yellow-faced male miserables roosting
                              on the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws
                              in hands, grinding tobacco and discharging
                              the result at floating chips through
                              crevices left by lost milk-teeth; while
                              the rest of the family and the few 
                              farm-animals were huddled together in an
                              empty wood-flat riding at her moorings
                              close at hand. In this flatboat the family
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1264"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="450"> </a></span>
                              would have to cook and eat and sleep
                              for a lesser or greater number of days
                              (or possibly weeks), until the river should
                              fall two or three feet and let them get
                              back to their log-cabin and their chills
                              again—chills being a merciful provision
                              of an all-wise Providence to enable them
                              to take exercise without exertion. And
                              this sort of watery camping out was a
                              thing which these people were rather
                              liable to be treated to a couple of times
                              a year: by the December rise out of the
                              Ohio, and the June rise out of the Mississippi.
                              And yet these were kindly dispensations,
                              for they at least enabled the
                              poor things to rise from the dead now
                              and then, and look upon life when a
                              steamboat went by. They appreciated
                              the blessing, too, for they spread their
                              mouths and eyes wide open and made
                              the most of these occasions. Now what
                              
                              <hi id="d193447e1266" style="font-style: italic;">could</hi> these banished creatures find to
                              do to keep from dying of the blues during
                              the low-water season!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1270">Once, in one of these lovely island
                              chutes, we found our course completely
                              bridged by a great fallen tree. This
                              will serve to show how narrow some of
                              the chutes were. The passengers had
                              an hour's recreation in a virgin wilderness,
                              while the boat-hands chopped
                              the bridge away; for there was no such
                              thing as turning back, you comprehend.
                              From Cairo to Baton Rouge, when
                              the river is over its banks, you have no
                              particular trouble in the night, for the
                              thousand-mile wall of dense forest that
                              guards the two banks all the way is
                              only gapped with a farm or wood-yard
                              opening at intervals, and so you can't
                              “get out of the river” much easier than
                              you could get out of a fenced lane; but
                              from Baton Rouge to New Orleans it is a
                              different matter. The river is more than
                              a mile wide, and very deep—as much
                              as two hundred feet, in places. Both
                              banks, for a good deal over a hundred
                              miles, are shorn of their timber and bordered
                              by continuous sugar plantations,
                              with only here and there a scattering
                              sapling or row of ornamental China-trees;
                              The timber is shorn off clear to
                              the rear of the plantations, from two to
                              four miles; When the first frost threatens
                              to come, the planters snatch off their
                              crops in a hurry. When they have finished
                              grinding the cane, they form the
                              refuse of the stalks (which they call 
                              <hi id="d193447e1272" style="font-style: italic;">bagasse</hi>)
                              into great piles and set fire to
                              them, though in other sugar countries
                              the bagasse is used for fuel in the furnaces
                              of the sugar mills. Now the piles
                              of damp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke
                              like Satan's own kitchen.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1277">An embankment ten or fifteen feet
                              high guards both banks of the Mississippi
                              all the way down that lower end
                              of the river, and this embankment is set
                              back from the edge of the shore from
                              ten to perhaps a hundred feet, according
                              to circumstances; say thirty or forty feet,
                              as a general thing. Fill that
                              whole region with an impenetrable gloom
                              of smoke from a hundred miles of burning
                              bagasse piles, when the river is over
                              the banks, and turn a steamboat loose
                              along there at midnight and see how
                              she will feel. And see how you will
                              feel, too! You find yourself away out
                              in the midst of a vague dim sea that is
                              shoreless, that fades out and loses itself
                              in the murky distances; for you cannot
                              discern the thin rib of embankment,
                              and you are always imagining you see
                              a straggling tree when you don't. The
                              plantations themselves are transformed
                              by the smoke and look like a part of the
                              sea. All through your watch you are
                              tortured with the exquisite misery of
                              uncertainty. You hope you are keeping
                              in the river, but you do not know.
                              All that you are sure about is that you
                              are likely to be within six feet of the
                              bank 
                              <hi id="d193447e1279" style="font-style: italic;">and</hi> destruction, when you think
                              you are a good half-mile from shore.
                              And you are sure, also, that if you
                              chance suddenly to fetch up against the
                              embankment and topple your chimneys
                              overboard, you will have the small comfort
                              of knowing that it is about what
                              you were expecting to do. One of the
                              great Vicksburg packets darted out into
                              a sugar plantation one night, at such
                              a time, and had to stay there a week.
                              But there was no novelty about it; it
                              had often been done before.

                              it is in my mind. It is only relevant
                              in that it is connected with piloting.
                              There used to be an excellent pilot on
                              the river, a Mr. X., who was a somnambulist.
                              It was said that if his mind
                              was troubled about a bad piece of river,
                              he was pretty sure to get up and walk
                              in his sleep and do strange things. He
                              was once fellow-pilot for a trip or two
                              with George E—, on a great New
                              Orleans passenger packet. During a
                              considerable part of the first trip George
                              was uneasy, but got over it by and by,
                              as X. seemed content to stay in his bed
                              when asleep. Late one night the boat
                              was approaching Helena, Arkansas; the
                              water was low, and the crossing above
                              the town in a very blind and tangled
                              condition. X. had seen the crossing
                              since E— had, and as the night was
                              particularly drizzly, sullen, and dark,
                              E— was considering whether he had
                              not better have X. called to assist in
                              running the place, when the door opened
                              and X. walked in. Now on very dark
                              nights, light is a deadly enemy to piloting;
                              you are aware that if you stand in
                              a lighted room, on such a night, you
                              cannot see things in the street to any
                              purpose; but if you put out the lights
                              and stand in the gloom you can make
                              out objects in the street pretty well.
                              So on very dark nights, pilots do not
                              smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-house
                              stove if there is a crack which
                              can allow the least ray to escape; they
                              order the furnaces to be curtained with
                              huge tarpaulins and the sky-lights to be
                              closely blinded. Then no light whatever
                              issues from the boat. The undefinable
                              shape that now entered the pilot-house
                              had Mr. X.'s voice. This said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1288">“Let me take her, Mr. E—; I 've
                              seen this place since you have, and it is
                              so crooked that I reckon I can run it
                              myself easier than I could tell you how
                              to do it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1291">“It is kind of you, and I swear

                              willing. I have n't got another drop of
                              perspiration left in me. I have been
                              spinning around and around the wheel
                              like a squirrel. It is so dark I can't tell
                              which way she is swinging till she is
                              coming around like a whirligig.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1297">So E— took a seat on the bench,
                              panting and breathless. The black phantom
                              assumed the wheel without saying
                              anything, steadied the waltzing steamer
                              with a turn or two, and then stood at
                              ease, coaxing her a little to this side and
                              then to that, as gently and as sweetly as
                              if the time had been noonday. When
                              E— observed this marvel of steering,
                              he wished he had not confessed! He
                              stared, and wondered, and finally said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1300">“Well, I thought I knew how to steer
                              a steamboat, but that was another mistake
                              of mine.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1304">X. said nothing, but went serenely on
                              with his work. He rang for the leads;
                              he rang to slow down the steam; he
                              worked the boat carefully and neatly
                              into invisible marks, then stood at the
                              centre of the wheel and peered blandly
                              out into the blackness, fore and aft, to
                              verify his position; as the leads shoaled
                              more and more, he stopped the engines
                              entirely, and the dead silence and suspense
                              of “drifting” followed; when the
                              shoalest water was struck, he cracked on
                              the steam, carried her handsomely over,
                              and then began to work her warily into
                              the next system of shoal marks; the same
                              patient, heedful use of leads and engines
                              followed, the boat slipped through without
                              touching bottom, and entered upon
                              the third and last intricacy of the crossing;
                              imperceptibly she moved through
                              the gloom, crept by inches into her
                              marks, drifted tediously till the shoalest
                              water was cried, and then, under a tremendous
                              head of steam, went swinging
                              over the reef and away into deep water
                              and safety!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1307">E— let his long-pent breath pour
                              out in a great, relieving sigh, and said:
                           </p>

                           <p id="d193447e1319">A minute later E— was biting into
                              a pie, down in the “texas,” and comforting
                              himself with coffee. Just then
                              the night watchman happened in, and

                           <p id="d193447e1334">The next moment both men were flying
                              up the pilot-house companion-way,
                              three steps at a jump! Nobody there!
                              The great steamer was whistling down
                              the middle of the river at her own sweet
                              will! The watchman shot out of the
                              place again; E— seized the wheel, set
                              an engine back with power, and held his
                              breath while the boat reluctantly swung
                              away from a “towhead” which she was
                              about to knock into the middle of the

                           <p id="d193447e1383">WHEN the river is very low, and
                              one's steamboat is “drawing all the
                              water” there is in the channel,—or a
                              few inches more, as was often the case
                              in the old times,—one must be painfully
                              circumspect in his piloting. We
                              used to have to “sound” a number of
                              particularly bad places almost every trip
                              when the river was at a very low stage.
                              Sounding is done in this way. The
                              boat ties up at the shore, just above the
                              shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch
                              takes his “cub” or steersman and a
                              picked crew of men (sometimes an officer also),
                              and goes out in the yawl—
                              provided the boat has not that rare and
                              sumptuous luxury, a regularly-devised
                              “sounding-boat”—and proceeds to
                              hunt for the best water, the pilot on
                              duty watching his movements through a
                              spy-glass, meantime, and in some instances
                              assisting by signals of the boat's
                              whistle, signifying “try higher up” or
                              “try lower down;” for the surface of
                              the water, like an oil-painting, is more
                              expressive and intelligible when inspected
                              from a little distance than very close
                              at hand. The whistle signals are seldom
                              necessary, however; never, perhaps,
                              except when the wind confuses
                              the significant ripples upon the water's
                              surface. When the yawl has reached
                              the shoal place, the speed is slackened,
                              the pilot begins to sound the depth with
                              a pole ten or twelve feet long, and the
                              steersman at the tiller obeys the order
                              to “hold her up to starboard;”or “let

                           <p id="d193447e1395">When the measurements indicate that
                              the yawl is approaching the shoalest
                              part of the reef, the command is given
                              to “case all!” Then the men stop
                              rowing and the yawl drifts with the current.
                              The next order is, “Stand by with
                              the buoy!” The moment the shallowest
                              point is reached, the pilot delivers the
                              order, “Let go the buoy!” and over
                              she goes. If the pilot is not satisfied,
                              he sounds the place again; if he finds
                              better water higher up or lower down,
                              he removes the buoy to that place. Being
                              finally satisfied, he gives the order,
                              and all the men stand their oars straight
                              up in the air, in line; a blast from the
                              boat's whistle indicates that the signal
                              has been seen; then the men “give
                              way” on their oars and lay the yawl
                              alongside the buoy; the steamer comes
                              creeping carefully down, is pointed
                              straight at the buoy, husbands her power
                              for the coming struggle, and presently,
                              at the critical moment, turns on all her
                              steam and goes grinding and wallowing
                              over the buoy and the sand, and gains
                              the deep water beyond. Or maybe she
                              does n't; maybe she “strikes and swings.”
                              Then she has to while away several
                              hours (or days) sparring herself off.
                              Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all,
                              but the yawl goes ahead, hunting the
                              best water, and the steamer follows
                              along in its wake. Often there is a
                              deal of fun and excitement about sounding,
                              especially if it is a glorious summer
                              day, or a blustering night. But in winter
                              the cold and the peril take most of
                              the fun out of it.

                           <p id="d193447e1398">A buoy is nothing but a board four or
                              five feet long, with one end turned up;
                              it is a reversed boot-jack. It is anchored
                              on the shoalest part of the reef
                              by a rope with a heavy stone made fast
                              to the end of it. But for the resistance
                              of the turned-up end, the current would
                              pull the buoy under water. At night a
                              paper lantern with a candle in it is fastened
                              on top of the buoy, and this can
                              be seen a mile or more, a little glimmering
                              spark in the waste of blackness.

                           <p id="d193447e1401">Nothing delights a cub so much as
                              an opportunity to go out sounding.
                              There is such an air of adventure about
                              it; often there is danger; it is so gaudy
                              and man-of-war-like to sit up in the
                              stern-sheets and steer a swift yawl;
                              there is something fine about the exultant
                              spring of the boat when an experienced
                              old sailor crew throw their souls
                              into the oars; it is lovely to see the
                              white foam stream away from the bows;
                              there is music in the rush of the water;
                              it is deliciously exhilarating, in summer,
                              to go speeding over the breezy expanses
                              of the river when the world of wavelets
                              is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur,
                              too, to the cub, to get a chance to
                              give an order; for often the pilot will
                              simply say, “Let her go about!” and
                              leave the rest to the cub, who instantly
                              cries, in his sternest tone of command,
                              “Ease starboard! Strong on the
                              larboard! Starboard give way! With a
                              will, men!” The cub enjoys sounding
                              for the further reason that the eyes
                              of the passengers are watching all the
                              yawl's movements with absorbing interest,
                              if the time be daylight; and if it be
                              night he knows that those same wondering
                              eyes are fastened upon the yawl's
                              lantern as it glides out into the gloom
                              and fades away in the remote distance.

                           <p id="d193447e1404">One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent
                              her time in our pilot-house with her
                              uncle and aunt, every day and all day
                              long. I fell in love with her. So did
                              Mr. T—'s cub, Tom G—. Tom
                              and I had been bosom friends until this
                              time; but now a coolness began to arise.
                              I told the girl a good many of my river
                              adventures, and made myself out a good
                              deal of a hero; Tom tried to make himself
                              appear to be a hero, too, and succeeded
                              to some extent, but then he always
                              had a way of embroidering. However,
                              virtue is its own reward, so I was
                              a barely perceptible trifle ahead in the
                              contest. About this time something
                              happened which promised handsomely
                              for me: the pilots decided to sound the
                              crossing at the head of 21. This would
                              occur about nine or ten o'clock at night,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1406"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="569"> </a></span>
                              when the passengers would be still up;
                              it would be Mr. T—'s watch, therefore
                              my chief would have to do the sounding.
                              We had a perfect love of a sounding-boat—
                              long, trim, graceful, and as fleet
                              as a greyhound, her thwarts were cushioned;
                              she carried twelve oarsmen; one
                              of the mates was always sent in her to
                              transmit orders to her crew, for ours
                              was a steamer where no end of “style”
                              was put on.

                           <p id="d193447e1409">We tied up at the shore above 21, and
                              got ready. It was a foul night, and the
                              river was so wide, there, that a lands-man's
                              uneducated eyes could discern no
                              opposite shore through such a gloom.
                              The passengers were alert and interested;
                              everything was satisfactory. As I
                              hurried through the engine-room, picturesquely
                              gotten up in storm toggery, I
                              met Tom, and could not forbear 
                              delivering myself of a mean speech:—

                           <p id="d193447e1419">Tom was passing on, but he quickly
                              turned, and said,—

                              get the sounding-pole yourself. I was
                              going after it, but I 'd see you in Halifax,
                              now, before I 'd do it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1425">“Who wants you to get it? 
                              <hi id="d193447e1427" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> don't.
                              It 's in the sounding-boat.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1431">“It ain't, either. It 's been new-painted;
                              and it 's been up on the lady's-cabin
                              guards two days, drying.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1434">I flew back, and shortly arrived among
                              the crowd of watching and wondering
                              ladies just in time to hear the command:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1437">“Give way, men!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1441">I looked over, and there was the gallant
                              sounding-boat booming away, the
                              unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller,
                              and my chief sitting by him with the
                              sounding-pole which I had been sent
                              on a fool's errand to fetch. Then that
                              young girl said to me,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1444">“Oh, how awful to have to go out in
                              that little boat on such a night! Do you
                              think there is any danger?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1447">I would rather have been stabbed. I
                              went off, full of venom, to help in the
                              pilot-house. By and by the boat's lantern
                              disappeared, and after an interval
                              a wee spark glimmered upon the face of
                              the water a mile away. Mr. T—
                              blew the whistle, in acknowledgment,
                              backed the steamer out, and made for it.
                              We flew along for a while, then slackened
                              steam and went cautiously gliding
                              toward the spark. Presently Mr. T—
                              exclaimed,
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1450">“Hello, the buoy-lantern 's out!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1453">He stopped the engines. A moment
                              or two later he said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1456">“Why, there it is again!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1460">So he came ahead on the engines once
                              more, and rang for the leads. Gradually
                              the water shoaled up, and then began
                              to deepen again! Mr. T— muttered:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1463">“Well, I don't understand this. I
                              believe that buoy has drifted off the
                              reef. Seems to be a little too far to the
                              left. No matter, it is safest to run over
                              it, anyhow.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1466">So, in that solid world of darkness,
                              we went creeping down on the light.
                              Just as our bows were in the act of plowing
                              over it, Mr. T— seized the bell-ropes,
                              rang a startling peal, and exclaimed,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1469">“My soul, it 's the sounding-boat!”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1472">A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst
                              out far below—a pause—and then a
                              sound of grinding and crashing followed.
                              Mr. T— exclaimed,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1475">“There! the paddle-wheel has ground
                              the sounding-boat to lucifer matches!
                              Run! See who is killed!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1479">I was on the main deck in the twinkling
                              of an eye. My chief and the third
                              mate and nearly all the men were safe.
                              They had discovered their danger when
                              it was too late to pull out of the way;
                              then, when the great guards overshadowed
                              them a moment later, they were
                              prepared and knew what to do; at my
                              chief's order they sprang at the right
                              instant, seized the guard, and were
                              hauled aboard. The next moment the
                              sounding-yawl swept aft to the wheel
                              and was struck and splintered to atoms.
                              Two of the men, and the cub Tom,
                              were missing—a fact which spread like
                              wild-fire over the boat. The passengers
                              came flocking to the forward gangway,
                              ladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced,
                              and talked in awed voices of the dreadful
                              thing. And often and again I heard
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1481"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="30" data-tei-n="570"> </a></span>
                              them say, “Poor fellows! poor boy, poor
                              boy!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1484">By this time the boat's yawl was
                              manned and away, to search for the
                              missing. Now a faint call was heard,
                              off to the left. The yawl had disappeared
                              in the other direction. Half the
                              people rushed to one side to encourage
                              the swimmer with their shouts; the other
                              half rushed the other way to shriek
                              to the yawl to turn about. By the callings,
                              the swimmer was approaching, but
                              some said the sound showed falling
                              strength. The crowd massed themselves
                              against the boiler-deck railings,
                              leaning over and staring into the gloom;
                              and every faint and fainter cry wrung
                              from them such words as “Ah, poor
                              fellow, poor fellow! is there 
                              <hi id="d193447e1486" style="font-style: italic;">no</hi> way to
                              save him?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1490">But still the cries held out, and drew
                              nearer, and presently the voice said
                              pluckily—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1493">“I can make it! Stand by with a
                              rope!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1496">What a rousing cheer they gave him!
                              The chief mate took his stand in the
                              glare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in
                              his hand, and his men grouped about
                              him. The next moment the swimmer's
                              face appeared in the circle of light, and
                              in another one the owner of it was hauled
                              aboard, limp and drenched, while cheer
                              on cheer went up. It was that devil
                              Tom.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1499">The yawl crew searched everywhere,
                              but found no sign of the two men. They
                              probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled
                              back, and were struck by the wheel
                              and killed. Tom had never jumped for
                              the guard at all, but had plunged head-first
                              into the river and dived under the
                              wheel. It was nothing; I could have
                              done it easy enough, and I said so;
                              but everybody went on just the same,
                              making a wonderful to-do over that ass,
                              as if he had done something great. That
                              girl could n't seem to have enough of
                              that pitiful “hero” the rest of the trip;
                              but little I cared; I loathed her, any way.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1503">The way we came to mistake the
                              sounding-boat's lantern for the buoy-light
                              was this. My chief said that after
                              laying the buoy he fell away and watched
                              it till it seemed to be secure; then he
                              took up a position a hundred yards below
                              it and a little to one side of the steamer's
                              course, headed the sounding-boat
                              up-stream, and waited. Having to wait
                              some time, he and the officer got to talking;
                              he looked up when he judged that
                              the steamer was about on the reef; saw
                              that the buoy was gone, but supposed
                              that the steamer had already run over
                              it; he went on with his talk; he noticed
                              that the steamer was getting very close
                              down on him, but that was the correct
                              thing; it was her business to shave him
                              closely, for convenience in taking him
                              aboard; he was expecting her to sheer
                              off, until the last moment; then it flashed
                              upon him that she was trying to run him
                              down, mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light;
                              so he sang out, “Stand by to
                              spring for the guard, men!”and the next
                              instant the jump was made.

                           <p id="d193447e1506">But I am wandering from what I was 
                              intending to do, that is, make plainer
                              than perhaps appears in my previous papers,
                              some of the peculiar requirements
                              of the science of piloting. First of all,
                              there is one faculty which a pilot must
                              incessantly cultivate until he has brought
                              it to absolute perfection. Nothing short
                              of perfection will do. That faculty is
                              memory. He cannot stop with merely
                              thinking a thing is so and so; he must
                              
                              <hi id="d193447e1508" style="font-style: italic;">know</hi> it; for this is eminently one of the
                              “exact” sciences. With what scorn a
                              pilot was looked upon, in the old times,
                              if he ever ventured to deal in that feeble
                              phrase “I think,” instead of the vigorous
                              one “I know!” One cannot easily
                              realize what a tremendous thing it is to
                              know every trivial detail of twelve hundred
                              miles of river and know it with absolute
                              exactness. If you will take the longest
                              street in New York, and travel up and
                              down it, scanning its features patiently
                              until you know every house and window
                              and door and lamp-post and big and little
                              sign by heart, and know them so accurately
                              that you can instantly name the one you
                              are abreast of when you are set down at
                              random in that street in the middle of an
                              inky black night, you will then have a
                              tolerable notion of the amount and the
                              exactness of a pilot's knowledge who
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1511"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="571"> </a></span>
                              carries the Mississippi River in his head.
                              And then if you will go on until you know
                              every street crossing, the character, size,
                              and position of the crossing-stones, and
                              the varying depth of mud in each of those
                              numberless places, you will have some
                              idea of what the pilot must know in order
                              to keep a Mississippi steamer out of
                              trouble. Next, if you will take half of
                              the signs in that long street, and 
                              <hi id="d193447e1513" style="font-style: italic;">change
                                 their places
                              </hi> once a month, and still manage
                              to know their new positions accurately
                              on dark nights. and keep up with these
                              repeated changes without making any
                              mistakes, you will understand what is required
                              of a pilot's peerless memory by
                              the fickle Mississippi.

                           <p id="d193447e1517">I think a pilot's memory is about the
                              most wonderful thing in the world. To
                              know the Old and New Testaments by
                              heart, and be able to relate them glibly,
                              forward or backward, or begin at random
                              anywhere in the book and recite
                              both ways and never trip or make a mistake,
                              is no extravagant mass of knowledge,
                              and no marvelous facility, compared
                              to a pilot's massed knowledge of
                              the Mississippi and his marvelous facility
                              in the handling of it. I make this
                              comparison deliberately, and believe I
                              am not expanding the truth when I do
                              it. Many will think my figure too
                              strong, but pilots will not.

                              pilot's memory does its work; how
                              placidly effortless is its way! how 
                              
                              <hi id="d193447e1522" style="font-style: italic;">unconsciously</hi> it lays up its vast stores, hour
                              by hour, day by day, and never loses or
                              mislays a single valuable package of them
                              all! Take an instance. Let a leadsman
                              cry, “Half twain! half twain! half
                              twain! half twain! half twain!” until
                              it becomes as monotonous as the ticking
                              of a clock: let conversation be going on
                              all the time, and the pilot be doing his
                              share of the talking, and no longer listening
                              to the leadsman; and in the midst
                              of this endless string of half twains
                              let a single “quarter twain!” be interjected,
                              without emphasis, and then the
                              half twain cry go on again, just as
                              before: two or three weeks later that
                              pilot can describe with precision the
                              boat's position in the river when that
                              quarter twain was uttered, and give
                              you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks,
                              and side-marks to guide you, that you
                              ought to be able to take the boat there
                              and put her in that same spot again yourself!
                              The cry of quarter twain did not
                              really take his mind from his talk, but
                              his trained faculties instantly photographed
                              the bearings, noted the change
                              of depth, and laid up the important details
                              for future reference without requiring
                              any assistance from

                              If you were walking and talking
                              with a friend, and another friend at your
                              side kept up a monotonous repetition
                              of the vowel sound A, for a couple of
                              blocks, and then in the midst interjected
                              an R, thus, A, A, A, A, A, R, A, A,
                              A, etc., and gave the R no emphasis,
                              you would not be able to state, two or
                              three weeks afterward, that the R had
                              been put in, nor be able to tell what objects
                              you were passing at the moment it
                              was done. But you could if your memory
                              had been patiently and laboriously
                              trained to do that sort of thing mechanically.

                              and soundings, and his memory could
                              not help holding on to them with the
                              grip of a vice; but if you asked that
                              same man at noon what he had had for
                              breakfast, it would be ten chances to one
                              that he could not tell you. Astonishing
                              things can be done with the human
                              memory if you will devote it faithfully to

                              I never saw either of the Hardys,

                              people who knew them told me all these
                              things. And they said Captain Hardy,
                              wore yarn socks winter and summer just
                              the same, and his first wife's name was
                              Jane Shook,—she was from New England,
                              and his second one died in a lunatic
                              asylum. It was in the blood. She
                              was from Lexington, Kentucky. Name
                              was Horton before she was married.”

                           <p id="d193447e1565">And so on, by the hour, the man's
                              tongue would go. He could not forget
                              anything. It was simply impossible. The
                              most trivial details remained as distinct
                              and luminous in his head, after they had
                              lain there for years, as the most memorable
                              events. His was not simply a
                              pilot's memory; its grasp was universal.
                              If he were talking about a trifling letter
                              he had received seven years before, he
                              was pretty sure to deliver you the entire
                              screed from memory. And then, with
                              out observing that he was departing from
                              the true line of his talk, he was more
                              than likely to hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical
                              biography of the writer of that
                              letter; and you were lucky indeed if he
                              did not take up that writer's relatives,
                              one by one, and give you their biographies,
                              too.

                           <p id="d193447e1569">Such a memory as that is a great misfortune.
                              To it, all occurrences are of the
                              same size. Its possessor cannot distinguish
                              an interesting circumstance from
                              an uninteresting one. As a talker, he is
                              bound to clog his narrative with tiresome
                              details and make himself an insufferable
                              bore. Moreover, he cannot stick to his
                              subject. He picks up every little grain
                              of memory he discerns in his way, and
                              so is led aside. Mr. J— would start
                              out with the honest intention of telling
                              you a vastly funny anecdote about a dog.
                              He would be “so full of laugh” that
                              he could hardly begin; then his memory
                              would start with the dog's breed and personal
                              appearance; drift into a history of
                              his owner; of his owner's family, with
                              descriptions of weddings and burials that
                              had occurred in it, together with recitals
                              of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry
                              provoked by the same: then this
                              memory would recollect that one of these
                              events occurred during the celebrated
                              “hard winter” of such and such a year,
                              and a minute description of that winter
                              would follow, along with the names of
                              people who were frozen to death, and
                              statistics showing the high figures which
                              pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay
                              would suggest corn and fodder; corn and
                              fodder would suggest cows and horses;
                              the latter would suggest the circus and
                              certain celebrated bare-back riders; the
                              transition from the circus to the menagerie
                              was easy and natural; from the elephant
                              to equatorial Africa was but a
                              step; then of course the heathen savages
                              would suggest religion; and at the end
                              of three or four hours' tedious jaw, the
                              watch would change and J— would go
                              out of the pilot-house muttering extracts
                              from sermons he had heard years before
                              about the efficacy of prayer as a means
                              of grace. And the original first mention
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1571"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="573"> </a></span>
                              would be all you had learned about
                              that dog, after all this waiting and hungering.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1574">A pilot must have a memory; but there
                              are two higher qualities which he must
                              also have. He must have good and quick
                              judgment and decision, and a cool, calm
                              courage that no peril can shake. Give
                              a man the merest trifle of pluck to start
                              with, and by the time he has become a
                              pilot he cannot be unmanned by any danger
                              a steamboat can get into; but one
                              cannot quite say the same for judgment.
                              Judgment is a matter of brains, and a
                              man must 
                              <hi id="d193447e1576" style="font-style: italic;">start</hi> with a good stock of that
                              article or he will never succeed as a
                              pilot.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1580">The growth of courage in the pilot-house
                              is steady all the time, but it does
                              not reach a high and satisfactory condition
                              until some time after the young pilot
                              has been “standing his own watch,”
                              alone and under the staggering weight
                              of all the responsibilities connected with
                              the position. When an apprentice has become
                              pretty thoroughly acquainted with
                              the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly
                              with his steamboat, night or day,
                              that he presently begins to imagine that
                              it is 
                              <hi id="d193447e1582" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> courage that animates him; but
                              the first time the pilot steps out and leaves
                              him to his own devices he finds out it was
                              the other man's. He discovers that the
                              article has been left out of his own cargo
                              altogether. The whole river is bristling
                              with exigencies in a moment; he is not
                              prepared for them; he does not know how
                              to meet them; all his knowledge forsakes
                              him; and within fifteen minutes he is as
                              white as a sheet and scared almost to
                              death. Therefore pilots wisely train
                              these cubs by various strategic tricks
                              to look danger in the face a little more
                              calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to
                              play a friendly swindle upon the candidate.

                           <p id="d193447e1586">Mr. B— served me in this fashion
                              once, and for years afterward I used to
                              blush even in my sleep when I thought of
                              it. I had become a good steersman; so
                              good, indeed, that I had all the work to
                              do on our watch, night and day; Mr.
                              B— seldom made a suggestion to me;
                              all he ever did was to take the wheel on
                              particularly bad nights or in particularly
                              bad crossings, land the boat when she
                              needed to be landed, play gentleman of
                              leisure nine tenths of the watch, and
                              collect the wages. The lower river was
                              about bank-full, and if anybody had
                              questioned my ability to run any crossing
                              between Cairo and New Orleans
                              without help or instruction, I should
                              have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of
                              being afraid of any crossing in the lot, in
                              the 
                              <hi id="d193447e1588" style="font-style: italic;">day-time</hi>, was a thing too preposterous
                              for contemplation. Well, one matchless
                              summer's day I was bowling down
                              the bend above island 66, brim full of
                              self-conceit and carrying my nose as high
                              as a giraffe's, when Mr. B— said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1592">“I am going below a while. I suppose
                              you know the next crossing?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1595">This was almost an affront. It was
                              about the plainest and simplest crossing
                              in the whole river. One could n't come
                              to any harm, whether he ran it right or
                              not; and as for depth. there never had
                              been any bottom there. I knew all this,
                              perfectly well.

                           <p id="d193447e1602">“How much water is there in it?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1605">“Well, that is an odd question. I
                              could n't get bottom there with a church
                              steeple.”

                           <p id="d193447e1611">The very tone of the question shook
                              my confidence. That was what Mr. B—
                              was expecting. He left, without
                              saying anything more. I began to imagine
                              all sorts of things. Mr. B—,
                              unknown to me, of course, sent somebody
                              down to the forecastle with some
                              mysterious instructions to the leadsmen,
                              another messenger was sent to whisper
                              among the officers, and then Mr. B— 
                              went into hiding behind a smoke-stack
                              where he could observe results. Presently
                              the captain stepped out on the hurricane
                              deck; next the chief mate appeared;
                              then a clerk. Every moment
                              or two a straggler was added to my audience;
                              and before I got to the head of
                              the island I had fifteen or twenty people
                              assembled down there under my nose.
                              I began to wonder what the trouble was.
                              As I started across, the captain glanced
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1613"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="574"> </a></span>
                              aloft at me and said, with a sham uneasiness
                              in his voice,
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1616">“Where is Mr. B—?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1620">“Gone below. sir.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1623">But that did the business for me. My
                              imagination began to construct dangers
                              out of nothing, and they multiplied faster
                              than I could keep the run of them.
                              All at once I imagined I saw shoal water
                              ahead! The wave of coward agony that
                              surged through me then came near dislocating
                              every joint in me, All my confidence
                              in that crossing vanished. I
                              seized the bell-rope; dropped it, ashamed;
                              seized it again; dropped it once more;
                              clutched it tremblingly once again, and
                              pulled it so feebly that I could hardly
                              hear the stroke myself. Captain and
                              mate sang out instantly, and both together,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1626">“Starboard lead there! and quick
                              about it!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1629">This was another shock. I began to
                              climb the wheel like a squirrel; but I
                              would hardly get the boat started to
                              port before I would see new dangers on
                              that side, and away I would spin to the
                              other; only to find perils accumulating
                              to starboard, and be crazy to get to port
                              again. Then came the leadsman's sepulchral
                              cry:—
                           </p>

                              to the speaking-tube and shouted to the

                              looked around, and there stood Mr. B—,
                              smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then
                              the audience on the hurricane deck sent
                              up a shout of humiliating laughter. I
                              saw it all, now, and I felt meaner than
                              the meanest man in human history. I
                              laid in the lead, set the boat in her
                              marks, came ahead on the engines, and

                              hardly learned. Yet about the hardest
                              part of it was that for months I so
                              often had to hear a phrase which I had
                              conceived a particular distaste for. It

                           <p id="d193447e1727">IN my preceding articles I have tried,
                              by going into the minutiae of the science
                              of piloting, to carry the reader step by
                              step to a comprehension of what the science
                              consists of; and at the same time I
                              have tried to show him that it is a very
                              curious and wonderful science, too, and
                              very worthy of his attention. If I have
                              seemed to love my subject, it is no surprising
                              thing, for I loved the profession
                              far better than any I have followed since,
                              and I took a measureless pride in it.
                              The reason is plain: a pilot, in those
                              days, was the only unfettered and entirely
                              independent human being that
                              lived in the earth. Kings are but the
                              hampered servants of parliament and
                              people; parliaments sit in chains forged
                              by their constituency; the editor of a
                              newspaper cannot be independent, but
                              must work with one hand tied behind
                              him by party and patrons, and be content
                              to utter only half or two thirds of
                              his mind; no clergyman is a free man
                              and may speak the whole truth, regardless
                              of his parish's opinions; writers of
                              all kinds are manacled servants of the
                              public. We write frankly and fearlessly,
                              but then we “modify” before we
                              print. In truth, every man and woman
                              and child has a master, and worries
                              and frets in servitude; but in the day I
                              write of, the Mississippi pilot had 
                              <hi id="d193447e1729" style="font-style: italic;">none</hi>.
                              The captain could stand upon the hurricane
                              deck, in the pomp of a very brief
                              authority, and give him five or six orders,
                              while the vessel backed into the stream,
                              and then that skipper's reign was over.
                              The moment that the boat was under way
                              in the river, she was under the sole and
                              unquestioned control of the pilot. He
                              could do with her exactly as he pleased,
                              run her when and whither he chose, and
                              tie her up to the bank whenever his judgment
                              said that that course was best. His
                              movements were entirely free; he consulted
                              no one, he received commands from
                              nobody, he promptly resented even the
                              merest suggestions. Indeed, the law of
                              the United States forbade him to listen
                              to commands or suggestions, rightly considering
                              that the pilot necessarily knew
                              better how to handle the boat than anybody
                              could tell him. So here was the
                              novelty of a king without a keeper, an
                              absolute monarch who was absolute in sober
                              truth and not by a fiction of words.
                              I have seen a boy of eighteen taking a
                              great steamer serenely into what seemed
                              almost certain destruction, and the aged
                              captain standing mutely by, filled with
                              apprehension but powerless to interfere.
                              His interference, in that particular instance,
                              might have been an excellent
                              thing, but to permit it would have been
                              to establish a most pernicious precedent.
                              It will easily be guessed, considering the
                              pilot's boundless authority, that he was
                              a great personage in the old steamboating
                              days. He was treated with marked
                              courtesy by the captain and with marked
                              deference by all the officers and servants;
                              and this deferential spirit was quickly
                              communicated to the passengers, too. I
                              think pilots were about the only people
                              I ever knew who failed to show, in some
                              degree, embarrassment in the presence
                              of traveling foreign princes. But then,
                              people in one's own grade of life are not
                              usually embarrassing objects.

                           <p id="d193447e1733">By long habit, pilots came to put all
                              their wishes in the form of commands.
                              It “gravels” me, to this day, to put my
                              will in the weak shape of a request, instead
                              of launching it in the crisp language
                              of an order.

                           <p id="d193447e1737">In those old days, to load a steamboat
                              at St. Louis, take her to New Orleans
                              and back, and discharge cargo, consumed
                              about twenty-five days, on an average.
                              Seven or eight of these days the boat
                              spent at the wharves of St. Louis and

                              was hard at work, except the two pilots;

                              as if they had been on duty. The moment
                              the boat touched the wharf at either
                              city, they were ashore; and they were
                              not likely to be seen again till the last
                              bell was ringing and everything in readiness
                              for another voyage.

                           <p id="d193447e1745">When a captain got hold of a pilot
                              of particularly high reputation, he took
                              pains to keep him. When wages were
                              four hundred dollars a month on the Upper
                              Mississippi, I have known a captain
                              to keep such a pilot in idleness, under
                              full pay, three months at a time, while
                              the river was frozen up. And one must
                              remember that in those cheap times four
                              hundred dollars was a salary of almost
                              inconceivable splendor. Few men on
                              shore got such pay as that, and when
                              they did they were mightily looked up
                              to. When pilots from either end of the
                              river wandered into our small Missouri
                              village, they were sought by the best and
                              the fairest. and treated with exalted respect.
                              Lying in port under wages was
                              a thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed
                              and appreciated; especially if they
                              belonged in the Missouri River in the
                              heyday of that trade (Kansas times), and
                              got nine hundred dollars a trip, which
                              was equivalent to about eighteen hundred
                              dollars a month. Here is a conversation
                              of that day. A chap out of the
                              Illinois River, with a little stern-wheel
                              tub, accosts a couple of ornate and gilded
                              Missouri River pilots:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1748">“Gentlemen, I 've got a pretty good
                              trip for the up-country, and shall want
                              you about a month. How much will it
                              be?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1751">“Eighteen hundred dollars apiece.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1754">“Heavens and earth! You take my
                              boat, let me have your wages, and I 'll

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1757">I will remark, in passing, that Mississippi
                              steamboatmen were important in
                              landsmen's eyes (and in their own, too,
                              in a degree) according to the dignity
                              of the boat they were on. For instant,
                              it was a proud thing to be of the crew
                              of such stately craft as the Aleck Scott
                              or the Grand Turk. Negro firemen, deck
                              hands, and barbers belonging to those
                              boats were distinguished personages in
                              their grade of life, and they were well
                              aware of that fact, too. A stalwart darkey
                              once gave offense at a negro ball in
                              New Orleans by putting on a good many
                              airs. Finally one of the managers bustled
                              up to him and said,—
                           </p>

                              spruce young negro, who aired his importance
                              with balmy complacency, and
                              was greatly courted by the circle in which
                              he moved. The young colored population
                              of New Orleans were much given to
                              flirting, at twilight, on the pavements of
                              the back streets. Somebody saw and
                              heard something like the following, one
                              evening, in one of those localities. A
                              middle-aged negro woman projected her
                              head through a broken pane and shouted
                              (very willing that the neighbors should
                              hear and envy), “You Mary Ann, come

                              fact that a pilot's peculiar official position
                              placed him out of the reach of criticism
                              or command, brings Stephen W— 
                              naturally to my mind. He was a gifted
                              pilot, a good fellow, a tireless talker, and
                              had both wit and humor in him. He had
                              a most irreverent independence, too, and
                              was deliciously easy-going and comfortable
                              in the presence of age, official dignity,
                              and even the most august wealth.
                              He always had work, he never saved a
                              penny, he was a most persuasive borrower,

                              around a bit of harum-scarum, devil-may-care
                              piloting, that made it almost
                              fascinating—but not to everybody. He
                              made a trip with good old gentle-spirited
                              Captain Y— once, and was “relieved”
                              from duty when the boat got to
                              New Orleans. Somebody expressed surprise
                              at the discharge. Captain Y— 
                              shuddered at the mere mention of Stephen.
                              Then his poor, thin old voice
                              piped out something like this:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1806">“Why, bless me! I would n't have such
                              a wild creature on my boat for the world
                              —not for the whole world! He swears,
                              he sings, he whistles, he yells—I never
                              saw such an Injun to yell. All times of
                              the night—it never made any difference
                              to him. He would just yell that way,
                              not for anything in particular, but merely
                              on account of a kind of devilish comfort
                              he got out of it. I never could get
                              into a sound sleep but he would fetch
                              me out of bed, all in a cold sweat, with
                              one of those dreadful war-whoops. A
                              queer being,—very queer being; no respect
                              for anything or anybody. Sometimes
                              he called me ‘
                              <hi id="d193447e1808" style="font-style: italic;">Johnny.</hi>’ And he
                              kept a fiddle, and a cat. He played execrably.
                              This seemed to distress the
                              cat, and the cat would howl. Nobody
                              could sleep where that man—and his
                              family—was. And reckless? There
                              never was anything like it. Now you
                              may believe it or not, but as sure as I
                              am sitting here, he brought my boat
                              a-tilting down through those awful snags
                              at Chicot under a rattling head of steam,
                              and the wind a-blowing like the very
                              nation, at that! My officers will tell
                              you so. They saw it. And, sir, while he
                              was a-tearing right down through those
                              snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and
                              praying, I wish I may never speak again
                              if he did n't pucker up his mouth and go
                              to 
                              <hi id="d193447e1811" style="font-style: italic;">whistling!</hi> Yes, sir; whistling ‘Buffalo

                              calmly as if we were attending a funeral
                              and were n't related to the corpse. And
                              when I remonstrated with him about it,
                              he smiled down on me as if I was his
                              child, and told me to run in the house
                              and try to be good, and not be meddling

                           <p id="d193447e1824">Once a pretty mean captain caught
                              Stephen in New Orleans out of work and
                              as usual out of money. He laid steady
                              siege to Stephen, who was in a very
                              “close place,” and finally persuaded
                              him to hire with him at one hundred and
                              twenty-five dollars per month, just half
                              wages, the captain agreeing not to divulge
                              the secret and so bring down the
                              contempt of all the guild upon the poor
                              fellow. But the boat was not more than
                              a day out of New Orleans before Stephen
                              discovered that the captain was boasting
                              of his exploit, and that all the officers
                              had been told. Stephen winced, but said
                              nothing. About the middle of the afternoon
                              the captain stepped out on the hurricane
                              deck, cast his eye around, and
                              looked a good deal surprised. He glanced
                              inquiringly aloft at Stephen, but Stephen
                              was whistling placidly, and attending to
                              business. The captain stood around a
                              while in evident discomfort, and once or
                              twice seemed about to make a suggestion;
                              but the etiquette of the river taught
                              him to avoid that sort of rashness, and
                              so he managed to hold his peace. He
                              chafed and puzzled a few minutes longer,
                              then retired to his apartments. But
                              soon he was out again, and apparently
                              more perplexed than ever. Presently he
                              ventured to remark, with deference,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1827">“Pretty good stage of the river now,
                              ain't it, sir?”

                           <p id="d193447e1830">“Well, I should say so! Bank-full is
                              a pretty liberal stage.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1834">“Seems to be a good deal of current
                              here.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1837">“Good deal don't describe it! It 's
                              worse than a mill-race.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1840">“Is n't it easier in toward shore than
                              it is out here in the middle?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1843">“Yes, I reckon it is; but a body
                              can't be too careful with a steamboat.
                              It 's pretty safe out here; can't strike
                              any bottom here, you can depend on
                              that.”

                           <p id="d193447e1848">The captain departed, looking rueful
                              enough. At this rate, he would probably
                              die of old age before his boat got
                              to St. Louis. Next day he appeared
                              on deck and again found Stephen faithfully
                              standing up the middle of the river,
                              fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi,
                              and whistling the same placid
                              tune. This thing was becoming serious.
                              In by the shore was a slower boat
                              clipping along in the easy water and
                              gaining steadily; she began to make for
                              an island chute; Stephen stuck to the
                              middle of the river. Speech was wrung
                              from the captain. He said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1852">“Mr. W, don't that chute cut
                              off a good deal of distance?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1855">“I think it does, but I don't know.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1858">“Don't know! Well, isn't there
                              water enough in it now to go through?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1861">“I expect there is, but I am not
                              certain.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1864">“Upon my word this is odd! Why,
                              those pilots on that boat yonder are going
                              to try it. Do you mean to say that
                              you don't know as much as they do?”

                              be uneasy; I know as much as any
                              man can afford to know for a hundred
                              and twenty-five!”

                           <p id="d193447e1877">Five minutes later Stephen was bowling
                              through the chute and showing the
                              rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar
                              pair of heels.

                           <p id="d193447e1880">One day, on board the Aleck Scott,
                              my chief, Mr. B—, was crawling
                              carefully through a close place at Cat
                              Island, both leads going, and everybody
                              holding his breath. The captain, a
                              nervous, apprehensive man, kept still as
                              long as he could, but finally broke down
                              and shouted from the hurricane deck,—

                              never raise the reef on this headway!”
                           </p>

                              But five minutes later, when the danger
                              was past and the leads laid in, he
                              burst instantly into a consuming fury,
                              and gave the captain the most admirable
                              cursing I ever listened to. No bloodshed
                              ensued; but that was because the
                              captain's cause was weak; for ordinarily
                              he was not a man to take correction
                              quietly.

                           <p id="d193447e1889">Having now set forth in detail the
                              nature of the science of piloting, and
                              likewise described the rank which the
                              pilot held among the fraternity of steamboatmen,
                              this seems a fitting place to
                              say a few words about an organization
                              which the pilots once formed for the
                              protection of their guild. It was curious
                              and noteworthy in this, that it
                              was perhaps the compactest, the completest,
                              and the strongest commercial
                              organization ever formed among men.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1892">For a long time wages had been two
                              hundred and fifty dollars a month; but
                              curiously enough, as steamboats multiplied
                              and business increased, the wages
                              began to fall, little by little. It was
                              easy to discover the reason of this. Too
                              many pilots were being “made.” It
                              was nice to have a “cub,” a steersman,
                              to do all the hard work for a couple of
                              years, gratis, while his master sat on a
                              high bench and smoked; all pilots and
                              captains had sons or brothers who wanted
                              to be pilots. By and by it came to
                              pass that nearly every pilot on the river
                              had a steersman. When a steersman
                              had made an amount of progress that
                              was satisfactory to any two pilots in the
                              trade, they could get a pilot's license for
                              him by signing an application directed
                              to the United States Inspector. Nothing
                              further was needed; usually no questions
                              were asked, no proofs of capacity
                              required.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1896">Very well, this growing swarm of new
                              pilots presently began to undermine the
                              wages, in order to get berths. Too
                              late—apparently—the knights of the
                              tiller perceived their mistake. Plainly,
                              something had to be done, and quickly;
                              but what was to be the needful thing?
                              A close organization. Nothing else
                              would answer. To compass this seemed
                              an impossibility; so it was talked, and
                              talked, and then dropped. It was too
                              likely to ruin whoever ventured to move
                              in the matter. But at last about a dozen
                              of the boldest—and some of them
                              the best—pilots on the river launched
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1898"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="725"> </a></span>
                              themselves into the enterprise and took
                              all the chances. They got a special
                              charter from the legislature, with large
                              powers, under the name of the Pilots'
                              Benevolent Association; elected their
                              officers, completed their organization,
                              contributed capital, put “association”
                              wages up to two hundred and fifty dollars
                              at once—and then retired to their
                              homes, for they were promptly discharged
                              from employment. But there
                              were two or three unnoticed trifles in
                              their by-laws which had the seeds of
                              propagation in them. For instance, all
                              idle members of the association, in good
                              standing, were entitled to a pension of
                              twenty-five dollars per month. This
                              began to bring in one straggler after
                              another from the ranks of the new-fledged
                              pilots, in the dull (summer) season.
                              Better have twenty-five dollars
                              than starve; the initiation fee was only
                              twelve dollars, and no dues required
                              from the unemployed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1901">Also, the widows of deceased members
                              in good standing could draw twenty-five
                              dollars per month, and a certain
                              sum for each of their children. Also,
                              the said deceased would be buried at
                              the association's expense. These things
                              resurrected all the superannuated and
                              forgotten pilots in the Mississippi Valley.
                              They came from farms, they came
                              from interior villages, they came from
                              everywhere. They came on crutches,
                              on drays, in ambulances,—any way, so
                              they got there. They paid in their
                              twelve dollars, and straightway began
                              to draw out twenty-five dollars a month
                              and calculate their burial bills.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1904">By and by, all the useless, helpless
                              pilots, and a dozen first-class ones, were
                              in the association, and nine tenths of
                              the best pilots out of it and laughing
                              at it. It was the laughing-stock of the
                              whole river. Everybody joked about
                              the by-law requiring members to pay ten
                              per cent. of their wages, every mouth,
                              into the treasury for the support of the
                              association, whereas all the members
                              were outcast and tabooed, and no one
                              would employ them. Everybody was
                              derisively grateful to the association for
                              taking all the worthless pilots out of the
                              way and leaving the whole field to the
                              excellent and the deserving; and everybody
                              was not only jocularly grateful for
                              that, but for a result which naturally
                              followed, namely, the gradual advance
                              of wages as the busy season approached.
                              Wages had gone up from the low figure
                              of one hundred dollars a month to one
                              hundred and twenty-five, and in some
                              cases to one hundred and fifty; and it
                              was great fun to enlarge upon the fact
                              that this charming thing had been accomplished
                              by a body of men not one of
                              whom received a particle of benefit from
                              it. Some of the jokers used to call at
                              the association rooms and have a good
                              time chaffing the members and offering
                              them the charity of taking them as steersmen
                              for a trip, so that they could see
                              what the forgotten river looked like.
                              However, the association was content; or
                              at least it gave no sign to the contrary.
                              Now and then it captured a pilot who
                              was “out of luck,” and added him to
                              its list; and these later additions were
                              very valuable, for they were good pilots;
                              the incompetent ones had all been absorbed
                              before. As business freshened,
                              wages climbed gradually up to two hundred
                              and fifty dollars—the association
                              figure—and became firmly fixed there;
                              and still without benefiting a member of
                              that body, for no member was hired.
                              The hilarity at the association's expense
                              burst all bounds, now. There was no
                              end to the fun which that poor martyr
                              had to put up with.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1907">However, it is a long lane that has no
                              turning. Winter approached, business
                              doubled and trebled, and an avalanche
                              of Missouri, Illinois, and Upper Mississippi
                              River boats came pouring down
                              to take a chance in the New Orleans
                              trade. All of a sudden, pilots were in
                              great demand, and were correspondingly
                              scarce. The time for revenge was
                              come. It was a bitter pill to have to
                              accept association pilots at last, yet captains
                              and owners agreed that there was
                              no other way. But none of these outcasts
                              offered! So there was a still bitterer
                              pill to be swallowed: they must be
                              sought out and asked for their services.
                              Captain— was the first man who
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1909"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="726"> </a></span>
                              found it necessary to take the dose, and
                              he had been the loudest derider of the
                              organization. He hunted up one of the
                              best of the association pilots and said,—

                              best of us for a little while, so I 'll give
                              in with as good a grace as I can. I 've

                              In the end he had to discharge
                              S—, pay him about a thousand dollars,
                              and take an association pilot in his
                              place. The laugh was beginning to
                              turn the other way, now. Every day,
                              thenceforward, a new victim fell; every
                              day some outraged captain discharged
                              a non-association pet, with tears and
                              profanity, and installed a hated association
                              man in his berth. In a very little
                              while, idle non-associationists began to be
                              pretty plenty, brisk as business was, and
                              much as their services were desired.
                              The laugh was shifting to the other side
                              of their mouths most palpably. These
                              victims, together with the captains and
                              owners, presently ceased to laugh altogether,
                              and began to rage about the revenge
                              they would take when the passing
                              business “spurt” was over.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e1966">Soon all the laughers that were left
                              were the owners and crews of boats that
                              had two non-association pilots. But
                              their triumph was not very long-lived.
                              For this reason: It was a rigid rule of
                              the association that its members should
                              never, under any circumstances whatever,
                              give information about the channel
                              to any “outsider.” By this time about
                              half the boats had none but association
                              pilots, and the other half had none but
                              outsiders. At the first glance one would
                              suppose that when it came to forbidding
                              information about the river these two
                              parties could play equally at that game;
                              but this was not so. At every good-sized
                              town from one end of the river to
                              the other, there was a “wharf-boat” to
                              land at, instead of a wharf or a pier.
                              Freight was stored in it for transportation,
                              waiting passengers slept in its cabins.
                              Upon each of these wharf-boats
                              the association's officers placed a strong
                              box, fastened with a peculiar lock which
                              was used in no other service but one—
                              the United States mail service. It was
                              the letter-bag lock, a sacred governmental
                              thing. By dint of much beseeching
                              the government had been persuaded
                              to allow the association to use this lock.
                              Every association man carried a key
                              which would open these boxes. That
                              key, or rather a peculiar way of holding
                              it in the hand when its owner was
                              asked for river information by a stranger,
                              —for the success of the St. Louis and
                              New Orleans association had now bred
                              tolerably thriving branches in a dozen
                              neighboring steamboat trades,—was the
                              association man's sign and diploma of
                              membership; and if the stranger did not
                              respond by producing a similar key and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e1968"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="727"> </a></span>
                              holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed,
                              his question was politely ignored.
                              From the association's secretary each
                              member received a package of more or
                              less gorgeous blanks, printed like a bill-head,
                              on handsome paper, properly ruled
                              in columns; a bill-head worded something 
                              like this:—

                              was shifting every day! The pilot who

                              <hi id="d193447e2004" style="font-style: italic;">after</hi> which he was free to visit
                              his family. In these parlors a crowd
                              was always gathered together, discussing
                              changes in the channel, and the moment
                              there was a fresh arrival, everybody
                              stopped talking till this witness had
                              told the newest news and settled the
                              latest uncertainty. Other craftsmen can
                              “sink the shop,” sometimes, and interest
                              themselves in other matters. Not
                              so with a pilot; he must devote himself
                              wholly to his profession and talk of
                              nothing else; for it would be small gain
                              to be perfect one day and imperfect the
                              next. He has no time or words to
                              waste if he would keep “posted.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2008">But the outsiders had a hard time
                              of it. No particular place to meet and
                              exchange information, no wharf-boat
                              reports, none but chance and unsatisfactory
                              ways of getting news. The consequence
                              was that a man sometimes had
                              to run five hundred miles of river on
                              information that was a week or ten days
                              old. At a fair stage of the river that
                              might have answered; but when the
                              dead low water came it was destructive.
                              Now came another perfectly logical
                              result. The outsiders began to ground
                              steamboats, sink them, and get into all
                              sorts of trouble, whereas accidents
                              seemed to keep entirely away from the
                              association men. Wherefore even the
                              owners and captains of boats furnished
                              exclusively with outsiders, and previously
                              considered to be wholly independent of
                              the association and free to comfort themselves
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d193447e2010"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="42" data-tei-n="728"> </a></span>
                              with brag and laughter, began to
                              feel pretty uncomfortable. Still, they
                              made a show of keeping up the brag,
                              until one black day when every captain
                              of the lot was formally ordered immediately
                              to discharge his outsiders and take
                              association pilots in their stead. And
                              who was it that had the gaudy presumption
                              to do that? Alas, it came from a
                              power behind the throne that was greater
                              than the throne itself. It was the
                              underwriters!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2013">It was no time to “swap knives.”
                              Every outsider had to take his trunk
                              ashore at once. Of course it was supposed
                              that there was collusion between
                              the association and the underwriters,
                              but this was not so. The latter had
                              come to comprehend the excellence of
                              the “report” system of the association
                              and the safety it secured, and so they
                              had made their decision among themselves
                              and upon plain business principles.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2017">There was weeping and wailing and
                              gnashing of teeth in the camp of the
                              outsiders now. But no matter, there
                              was but one course for them to pursue,
                              and they pursued it. They came forward
                              in couples and groups, and proffered
                              their twelve dollars and asked for
                              membership. They were surprised to
                              learn that several new by-laws had been
                              long ago added. For instance, the initiation
                              fee had been raised to fifty dollars:
                              that sum must be tendered, and
                              also ten per cent. of the wages which
                              the applicant had received each and
                              every month since the founding of the
                              association. In many cases this amounted
                              to three or four hundred dollars.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2020">Still, the association would not entertain
                              the application until the money was
                              present. Even then a single adverse
                              vote killed the application. Every member
                              had to vote yes or no in person and
                              before witnesses; so it took weeks to decide
                              a candidacy, because many pilots
                              were so long absent on voyages. However,
                              the repentant sinners scraped their
                              savings together, and one by one, by our
                              tedious voting process, they were added
                              to the fold. A time came, at last, when
                              only about ten remained outside. They
                              said they would starve before they would
                              apply. They remained idle a long while,
                              because of course nobody could venture
                              to employ them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2023">By and by the association published
                              the fact that upon a certain date the
                              wages would be raised to five hundred
                              dollars per month. All the branch associations
                              had grown strong, now, and
                              the Red River one had advanced wages
                              to seven hundred dollars a month. Reluctantly
                              the ten outsiders yielded, in
                              view of these things, and made application.
                              There was 
                              <hi id="d193447e2025" style="font-style: italic;">another</hi> new by-law,
                              by this time, which required them to
                              pay dues not only on all the wages they
                              had received since the association was
                              born, but also on what they would have
                              received if they had continued at work
                              up to the time of their application, instead 
                              of going off to pout in idleness.
                              It turned out to be a difficult matter to
                              elect them, but it was accomplished at
                              last. The most virulent sinner of this
                              batch had stayed out and allowed
                              “dues” to accumulate against him so
                              long that he had to send in six hundred
                              and twenty-five dollars with his application.

                           <p id="d193447e2029">The association had a good bank account
                              now, and was very strong. There
                              was no longer an outsider. A by-law
                              was added forbidding the reception of
                              any more cubs or apprentices for five
                              years; after which time a limited number
                              would be taken, not by individuals,
                              but by the association, upon these
                              terms: the applicant must not be less
                              than eighteen years old, of respectable
                              family and good character; he must pass
                              an examination as to education, pay
                              a thousand dollars in advance for the
                              privilege of becoming an apprentice, and
                              must remain under the commands of the
                              association until a great part of the
                              membership (more than half, I think)
                              should be willing to sign his application
                              for a pilot's license.

                              The president and secretary detailed
                              them for service on one boat or another,
                              as they chose, and changed them from

                              of the cubs would be ordered to go with

                              The association attended its
                              own funerals in state, and paid for them.
                              When occasion demanded, it sent members
                              down the river upon searches for
                              the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat
                              accidents; a search of this kind sometimes
                              cost a thousand dollars.

                           <p id="d193447e2041">The association procured a charter
                              and went into the insurance business,
                              also. It not only insured the lives of
                              its members, but took risks on steamboats.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2044">The organization seemed indestructible.
                              It was the tightest monopoly in the
                              world. By the United States law, no
                              man could become a pilot unless two
                              duly licensed pilots signed his application;
                              and now there was nobody outside
                              of the association competent to sign.
                              Consequently the making of pilots was at
                              an end. Every year some would die and
                              others become incapacitated by age and
                              infirmity; there would be no new ones
                              to take their places. In time, the association
                              could put wages up to any figure it
                              chose; and as long as it should
                              be wise enough not to carry the thing
                              too far and provoke the national government
                              into amending the licensing system,
                              steamboat owners would have to submit,
                              since there would be no help for it.

                              this one was removed. Incredible as it
                              may seem, the owners and captains deliberately
                              did it themselves. When the
                              pilots' association announced, months beforehand,
                              that on the first day of September,
                              1861, wages would be advanced
                              to five hundred dollars per month, the
                              owners and captains instantly put freights
                              up a few cents, and explained to the farmers
                              along the river the necessity of it, by
                              calling their attention to the burdensome
                              rate of wages about to be established.
                              It was a rather slender argument, but
                              the farmers did not seem to detect it. It
                              looked reasonable to them that to add
                              five cents freight on a bushel of corn was
                              justifiable under the circumstances, overlooking
                              the fact that this advance on a
                              cargo of forty thousand sacks was a good
                              deal more than necessary to cover the
                              new wages.

                           <p id="d193447e2050">So straightway the captains and owners
                              got up an association of their own,
                              and proposed to put captains' wages up
                              to five hundred dollars, too, and move
                              for another advance in freights. It was
                              a novel idea, but of course an effect which
                              had been produced once could be produced
                              again. The new association decreed
                              (for this was before all the outsiders
                              had been taken into the pilots'
                              association) that if any captain employed
                              a non-association pilot, he should
                              be forced to discharge him, and also pay
                              a fine of five hundred dollars. Several
                              of these heavy fines were paid before
                              the captains' organization grew strong
                              enough to exercise full authority over its
                              membership; but that all ceased, presently.
                              The captains tried to get the
                              pilots to decree that no member of their
                              corporation should serve under a non-association
                              captain; but this proposition
                              was declined. The pilots saw that they
                              would be backed up by the captains and
                              the underwriters anyhow, and so they
                              wisely refrained from entering into entangling
                              alliances.

                           <p id="d193447e2053">As I have remarked, the pilots' association
                              was now the compactest monopoly
                              in the world, perhaps, and seemed
                              simply indestructible. And yet the days
                              of its glory were numbered. First, the
                              new railroad stretching up through Mississippi,
                              Tennessee, and Kentucky, to
                              Northern railway centres. began to divert
                              the passenger travel from the steamers;
                              next the war came and almost entirely
                              annihilated the steamboating industry
                              during several years, leaving most of the
                              pilots idle, and the cost of living advancing
                              all the time; then the treasurer of
                              the St. Louis association put his hand
                              into the till and walked off with every
                              dollar of the ample fund; and finally, the
                              railroads intruding everywhere, there was
                              little for steamers to do, when the war
                              was over, but carry freights; so straightway

                              some genius from the Atlantic coast
                              introduced the plan of towing a dozen
                              steamer cargoes down to New Orleans
                              at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat;
                              and behold, in the twinkling of an eye,
                              as it were, the association and the noble
                              science of piloting were things of the
                              dead and pathetic past!

                              to leave New Orleans between four and
                              five o'clock in the afternoon. From three
                              o'clock onward they would be burning
                              rosin and pitch pine (the sign of preparation),
                              and so one had the picturesque
                              spectacle of a rank, some two or three
                              miles long, of tall, ascending columns of
                              coal-black smoke; a colonnade which
                              supported a sable roof of the same smoke
                              blended together and spreading abroad
                              over the city. Every outward-bound
                              boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff,
                              and sometimes a duplicate on the vergè
                              staff astern. Two or three miles of mates
                              were commanding and swearing with
                              more than usual emphasis; countless processions
                              of freight barrels and boxes were
                              spinning down the slant of the levee
                              and flying aboard the stage-planks; belated
                              passengers were dodging and skipping
                              among these frantic things, hoping
                              to reach the forecastle companion way
                              alive, but having their doubts about it;
                              women with reticules and band boxes were
                              trying to keep up with husbands freighted
                              with carpet-sacks and crying babies, and
                              making a failure of it by losing their
                              heads in the whirl and roar and general
                              distraction; drays and baggage-vans were
                              clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry,
                              every now and then getting blocked
                              and jammed together, and then during
                              ten seconds one could not see them for
                              the profanity, except vaguely and dimly;
                              every windlass connected with every
                              fore-hatch, from one end of that long
                              array of steamboats to the other, was
                              keeping up a deafening whiz and whir,
                              lowering freight into the hold, and the
                              half-naked crews of perspiring negroes
                              that worked them were roaring such
                              songs as De Las' Sack! De Las' Sack!
                              —inspired to unimaginable exaltation
                              by the chaos of turmoil and racket that
                              was driving everybody else mad. By
                              this time the hurricane and boiler decks
                              of the steamers would be packed and
                              black with passengers. The “last bells”
                              would begin to clang, all down the line,
                              and then the powwow seemed to double;
                              in a moment or two the final warning
                              came,—a simultaneous din of Chinese
                              gongs, with the cry, “All dat ain't goin',
                              please to git asho'!”—and behold,
                              the powwow quadrupled! People came
                              swarming ashore, overturning excited
                              stragglers that were trying to swarm
                              aboard. One more moment later a long
                              array of stage-planks was being hauled
                              in, each with its customary latest passenger
                              clinging to the end of it with
                              teeth, nails, and everything else, and the
                              customary latest procrastinator making
                              a wild spring shoreward over his head.

                              into the stream, leaving wide gaps
                              in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens
                              crowd the decks of boats that are not to
                              go, in order to see the sight. Steamer

                              all her strength, and presently comes
                              swinging by, under a tremendous head
                              of steam, with flag flying, black smoke
                              rolling, and her entire crew of firemen

                              massed together on the forecastle,
                              the best “voice” in the lot towering
                              from the midst (being mounted on the
                              capstan), waving his hat or a flag, and
                              all roaring a mighty chorus, while the
                              parting cannons boom and the multitudinous
                              spectators swing their hats and
                              huzza! Steamer after steamer falls into
                              line, and the stately procession goes
                              winging its way up the river.

                              torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun.
                              The public always had an idea that racing
                              was dangerous; whereas the very opposite
                              was the case—that is, after the
                              laws were passed which restricted each
                              boat to just so many pounds of steam to
                              the square inch. No engineer was ever
                              sleepy or careless when his heart was in
                              a race. He was constantly on the alert,
                              trying gauge-cocks and watching things.
                              The dangerous place was on slow, popular
                              boats, where the engineers drowsed
                              around and allowed chips to get into the
                              “doctor” and shut off the water supply
                              from the boilers.

                           <p id="d193447e2093">In the “flush times” of steamboating,
                              a race between two notoriously fleet
                              steamers was an event of vast importance.
                              The date was set for it several
                              weeks in advance, and from that time
                              forward, the whole Mississippi Valley
                              was in a state of consuming excitement.
                              Politics and the weather were dropped,
                              and people talked only of the coming
                              race. As the time approached, the two
                              steamers “stripped” and got ready.
                              Every incumbrance that added weight,
                              or exposed a resisting surface to wind or
                              water, was removed, if the boat could
                              possibly do without it. The “spars,”
                              and sometimes even their supporting
                              derricks, were sent ashore, and no
                              means left to set the boat afloat in case
                              she got aground. When the Eclipse and
                              the A. L. Shotwell ran their great race
                              twenty-two years ago, it was said that
                              pains were taken to scrape the gilding
                              off the fanciful device which hung between
                              the Eclipse's chimneys, and that
                              for that one trip the captain left off his
                              kid gloves and had his head shaved.
                              But I always doubted these things.

                           <p id="d193447e2096">If the boat was known to make her
                              best speed when drawing five and a half
                              feet forward and five feet aft, she was
                              carefully loaded to that exact figure
                              she would n't enter a dose of homoepathic
                              pills on her manifest after that.
                              Hardly any passengers were taken, because
                              they not only add weight but they
                              never will “trim boat.” They always
                              run to the side when there is anything
                              to see, whereas a conscientious and
                              experienced steamboatman would stick to
                              the centre of the boat and part his hair
                              in the middle with a spirit level.

                              it would be only “touch and go.” Coal
                              flats and wood flats were contracted for
                              beforehand, and these were kept ready

                              and the smartest pilots will win the race.
                              If one of the boats has a “lightning”
                              pilot, whose “partner” is a trifle his inferior,
                              you can tell which one is on watch
                              by noting whether that boat has gained
                              ground or lost some during each four-hour

                              for steering. Steering is a very high
                              art. One must not keep a rudder dragging
                              across a boat's stern if he wants to
                              get up the river fast.

                           <p id="d193447e2117">There is a marvelous difference in
                              boats, of course. For a long time I was
                              on a boat that was so slow we used to
                              forget what year it was we left port in.
                              But of course this was at rare intervals.
                              Ferry-boats used to lose valuable trips
                              because their passengers grew old and
                              died, waiting for us to get by. This was
                              at still rarer intervals. I had the documents
                              for these occurrences, but through
                              carelessness they have been mislaid. This
                              boat, the John J. Roe, was so slow that
                              when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend,
                              it was five years before the owners heard
                              of it. That was always a confusing fact
                              to me, but it is according to the record,
                              any way. She was dismally slow;
                              still, we often had pretty exciting times
                              racing with islands, and rafts, and such
                              things. One trip, however, we did rather
                              well. We went to St. Louis in sixteen
                              days. But even at this rattling gait I
                              think we changed watches three times
                              in Fort Adams reach, which is five miles
                              long. A “reach” is a piece of straight
                              river, and of course the current drives
                              through such a place in a pretty lively
                              way.

                           <p id="d193447e2123">Just about a generation ago, a boat
                              called the J. M. White went from New
                              Orleans to Cairo in three days, six
                              hours, and forty-four minutes. Twenty-two
                              years ago the Eclipse made the same
                              trip in three days, three hours, and
                              twenty minutes. About five years ago
                              the superb R. E. Lee did it in three
                              days and 
                              <hi id="d193447e2125" style="font-style: italic;">one</hi> hour. This last is called
                              the fastest trip on record. I will try to
                              show that it was not. For this reason:
                              the distance between New Orleans and
                              Cairo, when the J. M. White ran it,
                              was about eleven hundred and six miles;
                              consequently her average speed was a
                              trifle over fourteen miles per hour. In
                              the Eclipse's day the distance between
                              the two ports had become reduced to
                              one thousand and eighty miles; consequently
                              her average speed was a shade
                              under fourteen and three eighths miles
                              per hour. In the R. E. Lee's time the
                              distance had diminished to about one
                              thousand and thirty miles; consequently
                              her average was about fourteen and
                              one eighth miles per hour. Therefore
                              the Eclipse's was conspicuously the fastest
                              time that has ever been made.

                           <p id="d193447e2129">These dry details are of importance
                              in one particular. They give me an opportunity
                              of introducing one of the Mississippi's
                              oddest peculiarities,—that of
                              shortening its length from time to time.
                              If you will throw a long, pliant apple-paring
                              over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly 
                              shape itself into an average section of
                              the Mississippi River; that is, the nine
                              or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo,
                              Illinois, southward to New Orleans,
                              the same being wonderfully crooked, with
                              a brief straight bit here and there at wide
                              intervals. The two-hundred-mile stretch
                              from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by
                              no means so crooked, that being a rocky
                              country which the river cannot cut much.

                           <p id="d193447e2133">The water cuts the alluvial banks of
                              the “lower” river into deep horseshoe
                              curves; so deep, indeed, that in some
                              places if you were to get ashore at one
                              extremity of the horseshoe and walk
                              across the neck, half or three quarters
                              of a mile, you could sit down and rest a
                              couple of hours while your steamer was
                              coming around the long elbow, at a speed
                              of ten miles an hour, to take you aboard
                              again. When the river is rising fast,
                              some scoundrel whose plantation is back
                              in the country, and therefore of inferior

                              value, has only to watch his chance,
                              cut a little gutter across the narrow
                              neck of land some dark night, and turn
                              the water into it, and in it wonderfully
                              short time a miracle has happened: to
                              wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession
                              of that little ditch, and placed
                              the countryman's plantation on its bank
                              (quadrupling its value), and that other
                              party's formerly valuable plantation finds
                              itself away out yonder on a big island;
                              the old water-course around it will soon
                              shoal up, boats cannot approach within
                              ten miles of it, and down goes its value
                              to a fourth of its former worth. Watches
                              are kept on those narrow necks, at
                              needful times, and if a man happens to
                              be caught cutting a ditch across them,
                              the chances are all against his ever having
                              another opportunity to cut a ditch.

                           <p id="d193447e2138">Pray observe some of the effects of
                              this ditching business. Once there was
                              a neck opposite Port Hudson, Louisiana,
                              which was only half a mile across, in its
                              narrowest place. You could walk across
                              there in fifteen minutes; but if you made
                              the journey around the cape on a raft,
                              you traveled thirty-five miles to accomplish
                              the same thing. In 1722 the river
                              darted through that neck, deserted its
                              old bed, and thus shortened itself thirty-five
                              miles. In the same way it shortened
                              itself twenty-five miles at Black
                              Hawk Point in 1699. Below Red River
                              Landing, Raccourci cut-off was made
                              (thirty or forty years ago, I think).
                              This shortened the river twenty-eight
                              miles. In our day, if you travel by river
                              from the southernmost of these three cut-offs
                              to the northernmost, you go only
                              seventy miles. To do the same thing
                              a hundred and seventy-six years ago,
                              one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight
                              miles!—a shortening of eighty-eight
                              miles in that trifling distance. At some
                              forgotten time in the past, cut-offs were
                              made above Vidalia, Louisiana; at island
                              92; at island 84; and at Hale's Point.
                              These shortened the river, in the aggregate,
                              seventy-seven miles.

                           <p id="d193447e2141">Since my own day on the Mississippi,
                              I am informed that cut-offs have been
                              made at Hurricane Island; at island
                              100; at Napoleon, Arkansas; at Walnut
                              Bend; and at Council Bend. These
                              shortened the river, in the aggregate,
                              sixty-seven miles. In my own time a
                              cut-off was made at American Bend,
                              which shortened the river ten miles or
                              more.

                              Cairo and New Orleans was twelve hundred
                              and fifteen miles long one hundred
                              and seventy-six years ago. It was eleven
                              hundred and eighty after the cut-off of
                              1722. It was one thousand and forty
                              after the American Bend cut-off (some
                              sixteen or seventeen years ago.) It has
                              lost sixty-seven miles since. Consequently
                              its length is only nine hundred
                              and seventy-three miles at present.

                              ponderous scientific people, and “let
                              on” to prove what had occurred in the
                              remote past by what had occurred in a
                              given time in the recent past, or what
                              will occur in the far future by what has
                              occurred in late years, what an opportunity
                              is here! Geology never had such
                              a chance, nor such exact data to argue
                              from! Nor “development of species,”
                              either! Glacial epochs are great things,
                              but they are vague—vague. Please
                              observe:

                              six years the Lower Mississippi has
                              shortened itself two hundred and forty-two
                              miles. That is an average of a
                              trifle over one mile and a third per year.
                              Therefore, any calm person, who is not
                              blind or idiotic, can see that in the Old
                              Oölitic Silurian Period, just a million
                              years ago next November, the Lower
                              Mississippi River was upwards of one
                              million three hundred thousand miles
                              long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico
                              like a fishing-rod. And by the same
                              token any person can see that seven hundred
                              and forty-two years from now the
                              Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and
                              three quarters long, and Cairo and New
                              Orleans will have joined their streets
                              together, and be plodding comfortably
                              along under a single mayor and a mutual
                              board of aldermen. There is something
                              fascinating about science. One gets
                              such wholesale returns of conjecture out
                              of such a trifling investment of fact.

                           <p id="d193447e2156">When the water begins to flow through
                              one of those ditches I have been speaking
                              of, it is time for the people thereabouts
                              to move. The water cleaves the
                              banks away like a knife. By the time
                              the ditch has become twelve or fifteen
                              feet wide, the calamity is as good as
                              accomplished, for no power on earth
                              can stop it now. When the width has
                              reached a hundred yards, the banks
                              begin to peel off in slices half an acre
                              wide. The current flowing around the
                              bend traveled formerly only five miles
                              an hour; now it is tremendously increased
                              by the shortening of the distance.
                              I was on board the first boat
                              that tried to go through the cut-off at
                              American Bend, but we did not get
                              through. It was toward midnight, and
                              a wild night it was—thunder, lightning,
                              and torrents of rain. It was estimated
                              that the current in the cut-off
                              was making about fifteen or twenty
                              miles an hour; twelve or thirteen was
                              the best our boat could do, even in
                              tolerably slack water, therefore perhaps
                              we were foolish to try the cut-off.
                              However, Mr. X. was ambitious, and
                              he kept on trying. The eddy running
                              up the bank, under the “Point,” was
                              about as swift as the current out in the
                              middle; so we would go flying up the
                              shore like a lightning express train, get
                              on a big head of steam, and “stand by
                              for a surge” when we struck the current
                              that was whirling by the point.
                              But all our preparations were useless.
                              The instant the current hit us it spun
                              us around like a top, the water deluged
                              the forecastle, and the boat careened so
                              far over that one could hardly keep his
                              feet. The next instant we were away
                              down the river, clawing with might and
                              main to keep out of the woods. We
                              tried the experiment four times. I stood
                              on the forecastle companion way to see.
                              It was astonishing to observe how suddenly
                              the boat would spin around and
                              turn tail the moment she emerged from
                              the eddy, and the current struck her
                              nose. The sounding concussion and the
                              quivering would have been about the
                              same if she had come full speed against
                              a sand-bank. Under the lightning flashes
                              one could see the plantation cabins and
                              the goodly acres tumble into the river;
                              and the crash they made was not a bad
                              effort at thunder. Once, when we spun
                              around, we only missed a house about
                              twenty feet, that had a light burning in
                              the window; and in the same instant
                              that house went overboard. Nobody
                              could stay on our forecastle; the water
                              swept across it in a torrent every time
                              we plunged athwart the current. At
                              the end of our fourth effort we brought
                              up in the woods two miles below the cut-off;
                              all the country there was overflowed,
                              of course. A day or two later the cut-off
                              was three quarters of a mile wide,
                              and boats passed up through it without
                              much difficulty, and so saved ten miles.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2159">The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the
                              river's length twenty-eight miles. There
                              used to be a tradition connected with it.
                              It was said that a boat came along there
                              in the night and went around the enormous
                              elbow the usual way, the pilots not
                              knowing that the cut-off had been made.
                              It was a grisly, hideous night, and all
                              shapes were vague and distorted. The
                              old bend had already begun to fill up,
                              and the boat got to running away from
                              mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting
                              one. The perplexed pilots fell to
                              swearing, and finally uttered the entirely
                              unnecessary wish that they might never
                              get out of that place. As always happens
                              in such cases, that particular prayer
                              was answered, and the others neglected.
                              So to this day that phantom steamer is
                              still butting around in that deserted
                              river, trying to find her way out. More
                              than one grave watchman has sworn to
                              me that on drizzly, dismal nights, he has
                              glanced fearfully down that forgotten
                              river as he passed the head of the island,
                              and seen the faint glow of the spectre
                              steamer's lights drifting through the
                              distant gloom, and heard the muffled
                              cough of her 'scape-pipes and the plaintive
                              cry of her leadsmen.

                              beg to close this series of Old Mississippi
                              articles with one more reminiscence
                              of wayward, careless, ingenious “Stephen,”
                              whom I described in a former

                           <p id="d193447e2167">Most of the captains and pilots held
                              Stephen's note for borrowed sums ranging
                              from two hundred and fifty dollars
                              upward. Stephen never paid one of
                              these notes, but he was very prompt and
                              very zealous about renewing them every
                              twelvemonth.

                           <p id="d193447e2171">Of course there came a time, at last,
                              when Stephen could no longer borrow of
                              his ancient creditors; so he was obliged
                              to lie in wait for new men who did not
                              know him. Such a victim was good-hearted,
                              simple-natured young Yates (I
                              use a fictitious name, but the real name
                              began, as this one does, with a Y).
                              Young Yates graduated as a pilot, got a
                              berth, and when the month was ended
                              and he stepped up to the clerk's office
                              and received his two hundred and fifty
                              dollars in crisp new bills, Stephen was
                              there! His silvery tongue began to wag,
                              and in a very little while Yates's two
                              hundred and fifty dollars had changed
                              hands. The fact was soon known at
                              pilot headquarters, and the amusement
                              and satisfaction of the old creditors
                              were large and generous. But innocent
                              Yates never suspected that Stephen's
                              promise to pay promptly at the end of
                              the week was a worthless one. Yates
                              called for his money at the stipulated
                              time; Stephen sweetened him up and
                              put him off a week. He called then,
                              according to agreement, and came away
                              sugar-coated again, but suffering under
                              another postponement. So the thing
                              went on. Yates haunted Stephen week
                              after week, to no purpose, and at last
                              gave it up. And then straightway Stephen
                              began to haunt Yates! Wherever
                              Yates appeared, there was the inevitable
                              Stephen. And not only there, but
                              beaming with affection and gushing with
                              apologies for not being able to pay. By
                              and by, whenever poor Yates saw him
                              coming, he would turn and fly, and drag
                              his company with him, if he had company;
                              but it was of no use; his debtor
                              would run him down and corner him.
                              Panting and red-faced, Stephen would
                              come, with outstretched hands and eager
                              eyes, invade the conversation, shake
                              both of Yates's Arms loose in their sockets,
                              and begin:—

                              panorama. And now I 'm reminded!
                              How I do wish I could have seen
                              you an hour earlier! For twenty-four
                              hours I 've been saving up that two
                              hundred and fifty dollars for you; been
                              looking for you everywhere. I waited
                              at the Planter's from six yesterday evening
                              till two o'clock this morning, without
                              rest or food; my wife says, ‘Where
                              have you been all night?’ I said,
                              ‘This debt lies heavy on my mind.’
                              She says, ‘In all my days I never saw
                              a man take a debt to heart the way you
                              do.’ I said, ‘It is my nature; how can
                              
                              <hi id="d193447e2192" style="font-style: italic;">I</hi> change it?’ She says, ‘Well, do go
                              to bed and get some rest.’ I said, ‘Not
                              till that poor, noble young man has got
                              his money.’ So I set up all night, and
                              this morning out I shot, and the first
                              man I struck told me you had shipped
                              on the Grand Turk and gone to New
                              Orleans. Well, sir, I had to lean up
                              against a building and cry. So help me
                              goodness, I could n't help it. The man
                              that owned the place come out cleaning
                              up with a rag, and said he did n't like to
                              have people cry against his building, and
                              then it seemed to me that the whole
                              world had turned against me, and it was
                              n't any use to live any more; and coming
                              along an hour ago, suffering no man
                              knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson
                              and paid him the two hundred and fifty
                              dollars on account; and to think that here
                              you are, now, and I have n't got a cent!
                              But as, sure as I am standing here on
                              this ground on this particular brick,—there,
                              I 've scratched a mark on the
                              brick to remember it by,—I 'll borrow
                              that money and pay it over to you at
                              twelve o'clock sharp, to-morrow! Now,
                              stand so; let me look at you just once more.”

                              burden to him. He could not escape
                              his debtor and his debtor's awful sufferings
                              on account of not being able to pay.
                              He dreaded to show himself in the street,
                              lest he should find Stephen lying in wait
                              for him at the corner.

                              resort for pilots in those days. They
                              met there about as much to exchange
                              river news as to play. One morning
                              Yates was there; Stephen was there,
                              too, but kept out of sight. But by and
                              by, when about all the pilots had arrived
                              who were in town, Stephen suddenly
                              appeared in the midst, and rushed
                              for Yates as for a long-lost brother.

                           <p id="d193447e2204">“
                              <hi id="d193447e2206" style="font-style: italic;">Oh</hi>, I am so glad to see you! Oh
                              my soul, the sight of you is such a comfort
                              to my eyes! Gentlemen, I owe all
                              of you money; among you I owe probably
                              forty thousand dollars. I want to
                              pay it; I intend to pay it—every last
                              cent of it. You all know, without my
                              telling you, what sorrow it has cost me
                              to remain so long under such deep obligations
                              to such patient and generous
                              friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer—by far the sharpest—is 
                              from the debt
                              I owe to this noble young man here; and
                              I have come to this place this morning
                              especially to make the announcement
                              that I have at last found a method 
                              whereby I can pay off all my debts!
                              And most especially I wanted 
                              <hi id="d193447e2209" style="font-style: italic;">him</hi> to be
                              here when I announced it. Yes, my
                              faithful friend,—my benefactor, I 've
                              found the method! I 've found the
                              method to pay off 
                              <hi id="d193447e2212" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> my debts, and
                              you 'll get your money!” Hope dawned
                              in Yates's eye; then Stephen, beaming
                              benignantly, and placing his band upon
                              Yates's head, added, “I am going to
                              pay them off in alphabetical order!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2217">Then he turned and disappeared. The
                              full significance of Stephen's “method”
                              did not dawn upon the perplexed
                              and musing crowd for some two minutes;
                              and then Yates murmured with a
                              sigh:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d193447e2220">“Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance.
                              He won't get any further than the C's
                              in 
                              <hi id="d193447e2222" style="font-style: italic;">this</hi> world, and I reckon that after a
                              good deal of eternity has wasted away
                              in the next one, I 'll still be referred to
                              up there as ‘that poor, ragged pilot
                              that came here from St. Louis in the
                              early days!’ ”
