                           breakfasted. She was about fifteen years of age, and a remarkable favorite with his
                           lady. Rather taller than the middle size, she had the most elegant shape nature can
                           exhibit, and moved her well formed limbs with unusual gracefulness. Her face was full
                           of native modesty, and the most distinguished sweetness. Her eyes, as black as ebony,
                           were large, and full of expression, bespeaking the goodness of her heart. A
                           beautiful tinge of vermillion glowed through her dark cheeks, when she was gazed
                           upon. Her nose was perfectly well formed, and rather small. Her lips, a little
                           prominent, discovered, when she spoke, two regular rows of teeth as white as mountain
                           snow. Her hair was dark brown, <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d75307e157"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="1" data-tei-n="001"> </a></span>

                           ringlets, ornamented with flowers and gold spangles. Round her neck, arms, and
                           ancles, she wore gold chains, rings and medals. A shawl of India muslin was thrown
                           negligently over her polished shoulders; and a skirt of rich chintz completed her
                           apparel. In her delicate hand she carried a beaver hat, ornamented with a band of
                           silver. The figure and appearance of this charming creature could not but attract
                           my
