                        <p id="d56299e525">THINGS dramatic and things theatrical are often confounded together in the minds of
                           English people,
                           who, being for the most part neither the one nor the other, speak and write of them
                           as if they were
                           identical, instead of, as they are, so dissimilar that they are nearly opposite.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e528">That which is dramatic in human nature is the passionate, emotional, humorous element,
                           the simplest
                           portion of our composition, after our mere instincts, to which it is closely allied,
                           and this has no
                           relation whatever, beyond its momentary excitement and gratification, to that which
                           imitates it, and
                           is its theatrical reproduction; the dramatic is the 
                           <hi id="d56299e530" style="font-style: italic;">real</hi>, of which the theatrical
                           is the 
                           <hi id="d56299e533" style="font-style: italic;">false</hi>.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d56299e539">Both nations and individuals in whom the dramatic temperament strongly preponderates
                           are rather
                           remarkable for a certain vivid simplicity of nature, which produces sincerity and
                           vehemence of
                           emotion and expression, but is entirely without the 
                           <hi id="d56299e541" style="font-style: italic;">consciousness</hi> which is never
                           absent from the theatrical element.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e546">Children are always dramatic, but only theatrical when they become aware that they
                           are objects of
                           admiring attention ; in which case the assuming and dissembling capacity of 
                           <hi id="d56299e548" style="font-style: italic;">acting</hi>
                           develops itself comically and sadly enough in them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e552">The Italians, nationally and individually, are dramatic; the French, on the contrary,
                           theatrical; we
                           English of the present day are neither the one nor the other, though our possession
                           of the noblest
                           dramatic literature in the world proves how deeply at one time our national character
                           was imbued
                           with elements which are now so latent as almost to be of doubtful existence; while,
                           on the other
                           hand, our American progeny are, as a nation, devoid <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="5"> </a></span> of the dramatic
                           element, and have a considerable infusion of that which is theatrical, delighting,
                           like the
                           Athenians of old, in processions, shows, speeches, oratory, demonstrations, celebrations,
                           and
                           declarations, and such displays of public and private sentiment as would be repugnant
                           to English
                           taste and feeling; to which theatrical tendency, and the morbid love of excitement
                           which is akin to
                           it, I attribute the fact that Americans, both nationally and individually, are capable
                           of a certain
                           sympathy with the French character, in which we are wanting.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p id="d56299e557">The combination of the power of representing passion and emotion with that of imagining
                           or conceiving

                        <p id="d56299e696">MACBETH is pre-eminently the Drama of Con- science. It is the most wonderful history
                           of temptation,
                           in its various agency upon the human soul, that is to be found in the universal range
                           of imaginative
                           literature. Viewed in this aspect, the solemn march of the tragedy becomes awful,
                           and its
                           development a personal appeal, of the profoundest nature, to every one who considers
                           it with that
                           serious attention that its excellence as a work of art alone entitles :it to command.
                           To every human
                           soul it tells the story of its own experience, rendered indeed <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span>
                           more impressive by the sublime poetry in which it is uttered; but it is the truth
                           itself, and not
                           the form in which is it presented, which makes the force of its appeal; and the terrible
                           truth with
                           which the insidious approach of temptation — its imperceptible advances, its gradual
                           progress, its
                           clinging pertinacity, its recurring importunity, its prevailing fascination, its bewildering
                           sophistry, its pitiless tenacity, its imperious tyranny, and its final hideous triumph
                           over the
                           moral sense — is delineated, that makes 
                           <hi id="d56299e700" style="font-style: italic;">Macbeth</hi> the grandest of all poetical
                           lessons, the most powerful of all purely fictitious moralities, the most solemn of
                           all lay sermons

                        <p id="d56299e704">In a small pamphlet, written many years ago by Mr. John Kemble, upon the subject of
                           the character of
                           Macbeth, and which now survives as a mere curiosity of literature, he defends with
                           considerable
                           warmth the hero of the play from a charge of cowardice, brought against him either
                           by Malone or
                           Steevens in some of their strictures on the tragedy.

                        <p id="d56299e710">This charge appeared to me singular, as it would never have occurred to me that there
                           could be two
                           opinions upon the subject of the personal prowess of the soldier; who comes before
                           us heralded by

                           But, in
                           treating his view of the question, Mr. Kemble dwells, with extreme and just admiration,
                           upon the
                           skill with which Shakespeare has thrown all the other characters into a shadowy background,
                           in order
                           to bring out with redoubled brilliancy the form of Macbeth when it is first presented
                           to us. Banquo,
                           his fellow in fight and coadjutor in conquest, shares both the dangers and rewards
                           of his
                           expedition; and yet it is the figure of Macbeth which stands out prominently in the
                           van of the
                           battle so finely described by Rosse—it is he whom the king selects as heir to the
                           dignities of the
                           treacherous Thane of Cawdor—it is to meet him that the withered ambassadresses of
                           the powers of
                           darkness float through the lurid twilight of the battle day; and when the throb <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="30" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span> of the distant drum is heard across the blasted heath, among the host
                           whose tread it times over the gloomy expanse, the approach of one man alone is greeted
                           by the
                           infernal ministers. Their appointed prey draws near, and, with the presentiment of
                           their dire
                           victory over the victor, they exclaim, "A drum! a drum! Macbeth doth come!"

                           the light that emanates from, and surrounds as with a dazzling halo, the face and

                           grace and dignity of the one standing in the shadow behind it is more remarkable still.
                           How with
                           almost the first words that he speaks the majesty of right asserts itself over that

                           the serene power of a steadfast soul sheds forth a radiance which eclipses the glare
                           of mere martial
                           glory, as the clear moonlight spreads itself above and beyond the flaring of ten thousand

                           doom which hovers over the kind old king. With a heart overflowing with joy for the
                           success of his
                           arms, and gratitude towards his victorious generals, Duncan stands inhaling the serene

                           strikes at

                           guilt, have shut
                           their eyes, unwilling to behold the perpetration of the crime about to be committed.
                           The good old
                           king has retired to rest in unusual satisfaction, his host and hostess have made their

                           in wait. Banquo,
                           unwilling to yield himself to the sleep which treacherously presents to his mind,
                           through the

                           withdraw, supposing himself the last of all who wake in the castle; for on meeting
                           Macbeth he
                           expresses astonishment that he is not yet abed. How beautiful is the prayer with which
                           he fortifies

                           Macbeth speaks as sovereignly virtuous, but of which the mortal infirmity is thus
                           confessed by him
                           who best knows its treacherous weakness.

                           through dismal distant passages, and the flare of sudden torches flashes above and

                           with the horror that has seized like a frenzy on all its inmates. From the midst of
                           this appalling

                           the hypothesis was immediately abandoned on the recollection that Macbeth never had
                           been Thane of
                           Fife, and that it is Macduff's slaughtered mate Lady Macbeth is dreaming of,—the poor

                           all her pretty chickens, was destroyed at one fell swoop by Macbeth's murderous cruelty.

                        <p id="d56299e1085">The conversation that ensued led me to reflect on this mistaken suggestion of my friend

                           only the fact was not as suggested, but a fact of that nature, —viz. an accusing return
                           upon herself
                           by Lady Macbeth—could not be. Lady Macbeth, even in her sleep, has no qualms of conscience;
                           her
                           remorse takes none of the tenderer forms akin to repentance, nor the weaker ones allied
                           to fear,
                           from the pursuit of which the tortured soul, seeking where to hide itself, not seldom
                           escapes into
                           the boundless wilderness of madness.

                        <p id="d56299e1091">A very able article, published some years ago in the 
                           <hi id="d56299e1093" style="font-style: italic;">National Review</hi>, on the
                           character of Lady Macbeth, insists much upon an opinion that she died of remorse,
                           as some palliation
                           of her crimes, and mitigation of our detestation of them. That she died of 
                           <hi id="d56299e1096" style="font-style: italic;">wickedness</hi> would be, I think, a juster verdict. Remorse is consciousness of guilt,—often,
                           indeed, no more akin to saving contrition than the faith of devils, who tremble and
                           believe, is to
                           saving faith,— but still consciousness of guilt: and that I <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span> think
                           Lady Macbeth never had; though the 
                           <hi id="d56299e1101" style="font-style: italic;">unrecognised</hi> pressure of her great guilt killed
                           her. I think her life was destroyed by sin as by a disease of which she was unconscious,
                           and that
                           she died of a broken heart, while the impenetrable resolution of her will remained
                           unbowed. The
                           spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak; the body can sin but so much, and survive;
                           and other
                           deadly passions besides those of violence and sensuality can wear away its fine tissues,
                           and
                           undermine its wonderful fabric. The woman's mortal frame succumbed to the tremendous
                           weight of sin
                           and suffering which her immortal soul had power to sustain; and, having destroyed
                           its temporal house
                           of earthly sojourn, that soul, unexhausted by its wickedness, went forth into its
                           new abode of
                           eternity.

                           into Lady Macbeth's punishment is a capital error, because her punishment, in its
                           very essence,
                           consists in her infinite distance from all such influences. Macbeth, to the very end,

                           wring his hands, and tear his hair and gnash his teeth, and bewail the lost estate

                           induration. For he retains the unutterable consciousness of a soul; he has a perception

                        <p id="d56299e1147">I once read a pamphlet that made a very strong impression upon me, on the subject
                           of the possible
                           annihilation of the human soul as the consequence of sin. The author, supposing goodness
                           to be
                           nearness to God, and this to be the cause of vitality in the soul, suggested the idea
                           of a gradual,
                           voluntary departure from God, which should cause the gradual darkening and final utter
                           extinction of
                           the spirit. I confess that this theory of spiritual self-extinction through sin seemed
                           to me a
                           thousand times more appalling than the most terrific vision of everlasting torment.

                        <p id="d56299e1150">Taking the view I do of Lady Macbeth's character, I cannot accept the idea (held,
                           I believe, by her
                           great representative, Mrs. Siddons) that in the banquet scene the ghost of Banquo,
                           which appears to
                           Macbeth, is seen at the same time by his wife, but that, in consequence of her greater
                           command over
                           herself, she not only exhibits no sign of perceiving the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="62" data-tei-n="56"> </a></span>
                           apparition, but can, with its hideous form and gesture within a few feet of her, rail
                           at Macbeth in
                           that language of scathing irony which, combined with his own terror, elicits from
                           him the
                           incoherent, and yet too dangerously significant appeals with which he agonises her
                           and amazes the
                           court.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e1155">To this supposition I must again object that Lady Macbeth is no ghost-seer. She is
                           not of the
                           temperament that admits of such impressions; she is incapable of supernatural terror
                           in proportion
                           as she is incapable of spiritual influences; devils do not visibly tempt, nor angels
                           visibly
                           minister to her; and, moreover, I hold that, as to have seen Banquo's ghost at the
                           banqueting-table
                           would have been contrary to 
                           <hi id="d56299e1157" style="font-style: italic;">her</hi> nature, to have done so and persisted in her
                           fierce mocking of her husband's terror, would have been impossible to human nature.
                           The hypothesis
                           makes Lady Macbeth a monster, and there is no such thing in all Shakespeare's plays.
                           That she is
                           godless, and ruthless in the pursuit of the objects of her ambition, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="57"> </a></span> does not make her such. Many men have been so; and she is that unusual and unamiable
                           (but not
                           altogether unnatural) creature, a masculine woman, in the only real significance of
                           that much
                           misapplied epithet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e1164">Lady Macbeth was this; she possessed the qualities which generally characterise men,
                           and not
                           women—energy, decision, daring, unscrupulousness; a deficiency of imagination, a great
                           preponderance
                           of the positive and practical mental elements; a powerful and rapid appreciation of
                           what each
                           exigency of circumstance demanded, and the coolness and resolution necessary for its
                           immediate
                           execution. Lady Macbeth's character has more of the essentially manly nature in it
                           than that of
                           Macbeth. The absence of imagination, together with a certain obtuseness of the nervous
                           system, is
                           the condition that goes to produce that rare quality —physical courage—which she possessed
                           in a
                           pre-eminent degree. This combination of deficiencies is seldom found in men, infinitely
                           seldomer in
                           women: and its invariable result is <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="64" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span> insensibility to many
                           things—among others, insensibility to danger. Lady Macbeth was not so bloody as her
                           husband, for she
                           was by no means equally liable to fear; she would not have hesitated a moment to commit
                           any crime
                           that she considered necessary for her purposes, but she would always have known what
                           were and what
                           were not necessary crimes. We find it difficult to imagine that, if 
                           <hi id="d56299e1168" style="font-style: italic;">she</hi> had

                           escape, and
                           impossible to conceive that she would have ordered the useless and impolitic slaughter

                           family and followers, after he had fled to England, from a mere rabid movement of

                           and apprehension. She was never made savage by remorse, or cruel by terror.

                           is, if possible,
                           even more to the purpose. The spirit of the firm Roman, composed to peaceful meditation
                           after his
                           tender and sweet reconciliation with his friend, and his exquisite kindness to his
                           sleepy young
                           slave, is quietly directed to the subject of his study, when the ghost of Caesar appears
                           to him,
                           darkening by its presence the light of the taper by which he reads, and to which Shakespeare,
                           according to the superstition of his day, imparts this sensitiveness to the preternatural
                           influence.
                           Brutus, in questioning his awful visitor, loses none of his stoical steadfastness
                           of soul, and yet
                           speaks of his blood running cold, and his hair 
                           <hi id="d56299e1312" style="font-style: italic;">staring</hi> with the horror of the

                        <p id="d56299e1318">Surely, having thus depicted the effect of such an experience on such men as Horatio,
                           Hamlet, Brutus,
                           and Macbeth, Shakespeare can never have represented a woman, even though that woman
                           was the bravest
                           of her sex, and almost of her kind, as subjected to a like ordeal and utterly unmoved
                           by it. An
                           argument which appears to me conclusive on the point however, is, that in the sleeping
                           scene Lady
                           Macbeth divulges nothing of the kind; and, even if it were possible to conceive her
                           intrepidity
                           equal to absolute silence and self-command under the intense and mingled terrors of

                           unconscious confessions when she involuntarily strips bare the festering plagues of

                           its reward; and
                           the reward is blindness to fear, deafness to remorse, hardness to good, and moral
                           insensibility to

                           progress in guilt are marked by his own bitter consciousness of it. First, the startled

                           hellish oracles in which he has put his faith; and his furious excitement is the delirium
                           of mingled
                           doubt and dread with which he clings, in spite of the gradual revelation of its falsehood,
                           to the
                           juggling promise which pronounced him master of a charmed life. But no sooner is the
                           mist of this
                           delusion swept from his mind, by the piercing blast of Macduff's interpretation of
                           the promise, than
                           the heroic nature of the man once more proclaims itself. The fire of his spirit flames
                           above the

                        </head>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e1627">THE Queen and Wolsey in Henry VIII are both types of pride, and yet there is an essential
                           difference
                           in the pride which they each represent. Undoubtedly, the pride of birth and the mere
                           pride of power
                           (whether that power be derived from wealth, intellect, or exaltation of station) are
                           very different
                           things. Katharine represents the pure pride of birth, and Wolsey that of power. Pride
                           of birth, the
                           noblest species of the vice, is not incompatible with considerable personal humility,
                           and the proof
                           that Shakespeare thought so may be <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="90" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span> found in the Queen's frequently
                           modest and humble mention of herself, her infinite deference to the King, and the
                           repeated reference
                           by the other characters in the play to her meek and quiet spirit. That this pride
                           sometimes consorts
                           with humbleness arises from the fact that it does not rest on any personal, individual
                           quality or
                           achievement, and is therefore less directly egotistical and selfish than the other;
                           and being of a
                           less gross quality is oftener the snare of noble and refined minds, from which, when
                           once possessed
                           by it, it will hardly endure to be eradicated. For it becomes bound up with feelings
                           of personal
                           honour, family honour, and the order and economy of the body social and political,
                           of which nobility
                           forms a principal sustaining pillar in countries whose governments admit it as an
                           integral part of
                           their existence, and in upholding their particular portion of which nobly-born persons,
                           proud of
                           their birth, conceive that they contribute to maintain the whole. Birth, too, with
                           such persons, if
                           they be otherwise virtuously inclined, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="91" data-tei-n="85"> </a></span> becomes to them a spur and
                           incitement to high and lofty thoughts and deeds; for how runs the French device, 
                           <foreign style="font-style: italic;" id="fr">Noblesse oblige?</foreign>—a very weighty and worthy truth, making of high birth a
                           solemn trust to be solemnly fulfilled and answered for. Such, I think, is the pride
                           of some members
                           of the English aristocracy even in these democratic days; such was the family pride
                           of many
                           gentlemen of old and honourable name formerly in England; and, tainted as it is with
                           mortal
                           infirmity, there is but one better thing to be put in its place. The humility of a
                           true Christian is
                           doubtless a grander thing than the gentility of a true gentleman or the nobility of
                           a true nobleman:
                           meantime that man and that nation are in ill case in whom neither is to be found.
                           Of this
                           loftyseeming sin, this pride of birth, Shakespeare's Queen Katharine is a most perfect
                           type, as well
                           as an instance of the (almost) impossibility of a mind once infected with it ever
                           losing the taint.
                           No change of outward circumstance can affect it, and loss of fortune and decline of
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="86"> </a></span> station can only tend to increase, in those who have it, their veneration
                           for a species of dis- tinction compatible with the narrowest means and lowliest obscurity.
                           The pride
                           of power, that pride which Wolsey exhibits, is, on the contrary, almost invariably
                           arrogant, and
                           very seldom co-exists with any personal humility; for it springs generally from a
                           consciousness of
                           personal merit, strength, capacity, good fortune or achievement, and thus is necessarily
                           grossly
                           egotistical.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56299e1639">Again, the pride of birth is comparatively a relative thing, and has, as it were,
                           a scale or standard
                           by which it is graduated and moderated. The self-respect of those who entertain it
                           naturally
                           involves their respect for those who claim in any degree, whether more or less than
                           themselves, the
                           same distinction, whereas the pride of power is apt to lose all sense of comparison
                           in its
                           overweening self-consciousness: it knows no scale of degree, for its boast is to break
                           down or
                           overleap all such, and its measure is never the claims of others, but its <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="93" data-tei-n="87"> </a></span> own performed or possible achievement; and it is consequently in
                           perpetual peril of losing all balance. Nobly-born persons invariably speak respectfully
                           of the
                           ancient birth of others: their pride is of a determinate place in a settled system,
                           while the other
                           temper delights in nothing so much as in overturning established order by the self-created
                           precedent
                           of individual ability and success. To this Wolsey's whole language and demeanour during
                           his
                           prosperity bear ample witness: his insolence to the noblemen and gentlemen of the
                           court is nothing
                           more than a species of revenge taken by the butcher's son upon the sons of noblemen
                           and gentlemen
                           for being born such. Those who 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"achieve greatness"</quote> do not always, therefore,
                           encounter with perfect equanimity those who are 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"born great:"</quote> it takes a spirit of
                           rather unusual natural nobility to do so, and the dignity which is not shaken by falling
                           is as
                           nothing to the dignity which is not fluttered by rising. Wolsey, though he had made
                           himself cardinal
                           and hoped to make himself pope, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span> could not unmake himself a
                           butcher's son; and the serene sense of social superiority which men of high and princely
                           birth had
                           over him in this respect galled his consciousness of general power, in which he so
                           greatly excelled
                           them, with a bitter sense of utter impotence in this one particular. To this species
                           of aggressive
                           pride may be attributed the insane arrogance of his

                           of speech would have seemed nothing short of an audacious act of treason, an offence
                           against order,
                           duty, and majesty, a confounding of those all but sacred social laws by which they

                           upheld in their several high spheres of state. In the gross-minded, low-born

                           were merely the noble means of base self-aggrandisement.

                           and offensive, I
                           believe it will always be found more easily capable of cure and eradication than the
                           other. The
                           circumstances once altered under which personal power was or could be successfully
                           exercised,
                           consciousness of weakness and defeat almost inevitably ensues; uncertainty, self-distrust,
                           and a
                           sense of insecurity are engendered by failure; a lowered estimate of capacity to achieve
                           things not
                           unnaturally brings with it lessened value of the achievement. For we betake ourselves,
                           as the fox of
                           ancient times has testified ever since his day, to underprize that which is beyond
                           our reach,
                           however much we may have overprized while compassing or possessing it. After this

                           spirit sometimes ensues upon which a true humility might possibly engraft itself.
                           Thus, Wolsey might
                           have become humble when once hopelessly fallen from his high fortune, because, ruined,
                           he was
                           nothing in the world's account but the butcher's son, all whose personal ability had
                           not sufficed to
                           retain his great position, and might not suffice to regain it. In this predicament
                           the nobler powers
                           of his mind, shifting their point of view so as to take in more than the mere worldly
                           value of his
                           lost prosperity, might present to him a higher and holier standard by which his estimate
                           of the
                           earthly greatness he had forfeited would become more just, and his wisdom and learning
                           and powerful
                           intellectual faculties, chastened in their action by the sweet uses of adversity,
                           might finally
                           produce in him the grace of meekness and humility. The soil, loosened by the uprooting
                           of the rank
                           and noxious weeds of worldly pride and ambition, and harrowed by the bitterness of

                           wholesome abasement. And in Griffith's account of the great cardinal's death to Queen
                           Katharine he
                           insists upon this very result of his downfall, and the dying man's pathetic words

                           homage to that earthly one which had been rudely snatched from her brows. Wolsey honoured

                           entertained the doubts of modern commentators as to its being the work of Shakespeare;
                           and his <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="99" data-tei-n="93"> </a></span> admiration of it is characteristic when one considers the great
                           wisdom and fine morality by which the whole composition is pervaded. He told Mrs.
                           Siddons that his
                           highest enjoyment would be to see her perform Queen Katharine, for whose character,
                           as delineated by
                           Shakespeare, he had the most unbounded enthusiasm — naturally enough, as it is impossible
                           to
                           conceive a more perfect embodiment of the pure spirit of Toryism. The character is
                           one of great
                           simplicity, and hence in part the impression of grandeur it produces. Instead of the
                           infinitely
                           various motives, feelings, passions, and inclinations which make of most human characters
                           such
                           pieces of involved and complex moral machinery, two strongly developed elements alone
                           compose the
                           woman Shakespeare has copied from Nature and history—a profoundly conscientious and
                           devout spirit,
                           almost saint-like in its obedience to right and duty as she conceived of them, and
                           a towering and
                           indomitable spirit of pride, which so alloyed the more heavenly dispositions as <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="100" data-tei-n="94"> </a></span> to give harshness and narrowness to a nature otherwise noble, and stamp
                           with its own peculiarly rigid and stern image of royalty the pure gold of her high
                           and virtuous
                           qualities. Every speech Shakespeare puts into her mouth testifies to the wonderful
                           discrimination
                           with which he has delineated this combination of qualities, from her first solemn
                           rebuke to the Duke
                           of Buckingham's surveyor when she bids him beware lest in maligning a noble person
                           he should peril
                           his own nobler soul (her respect for the earthly dignity of the great peer being only
                           outweighed by
                           her respect for an immortal spirit), to the last dying words gasped from the wan and
                           withered lips,
                           when, later even than the desire she expresses that honour may be paid to her as a
                           chaste wife, she
                           commands that honour shall be paid to her as a queen and daughter of a king. This
                           last touching and
                           terrible utterance of the mingled virtue and vice is, as becomes the last, awful and

                           Undoubtedly, there were giants in those days in the art of play-writing, but it is
                           by their side
                           that we best measure the stature of him who was taller by the head and shoulders than
                           all the rest,
                           in whose incomparable genius the dramatic intellect of that great mental epoch reached
                           its climax. I
                           have read lately of comparisons between

                           them of him who
                           had worn them. I am much mistaken if Alfred Tennyson himself would not be more apt
                           than any one to
                           say (if it may unprofanely be said), "Why callest thou me Shakespeare ?"

                        <p id="d56299e1941">Opinions were, indeed, divided as to the intrinsic merit of the emendations or alterations.
                           Some of
                           the new readings were undoubted improvements, some were unimportant, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="112" data-tei-n="106"> </a></span> and others again were beyond all controversy inferior to the established
                           text of the passages; and it seemed not a little difficult to reconcile the critical
                           acumen and
                           poetical insight of many of the corrections with the feebleness and prosaic triviality
                           of
                           others.

                        <p id="d56299e1946">Again, it was observed by those conversant with the earlier editions, especially with
                           the little read
                           or valued Oxford edition, that a vast number of the passages given as emendations
                           in Mr. Collier's
                           folio were precisely the same in Hanmer's text. Indeed, it seems not a little remarkable
                           that
                           neither Mr. Collier nor his opponents have thought it worth their while to state that
                           nearly half,
                           and that undoubtedly the better half of the so-called new readings are to be found
                           in the finely
                           printed, but little esteemed, text of the Oxford Shakespeare. If, indeed, these corrections
                           now come
                           to us with the authority of a critic but little removed from Shakespeare's own time,
                           it is
                           remarkable that Sir Thomas Hanmer's, or rather Mr. Theobald's, ingenuity <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="113" data-tei-n="107"> </a></span> should have forestalled the 
                           <hi id="d56299e1950" style="font-style: italic;">fiat</hi> of Mr. Collier's folio
                           in so many instances. On the other hand, it may have been judged by others besides
                           a learned editor
                           of Shakespeare from whom I once heard the remark, that the fact of the so-called new
                           readings being
                           many of them in Rowe and Hanmer, and therefore well known to the subsequent editors
                           of Shake-
                           speare, who nevertheless did not adopt them, proved that in their opinion they were
                           of little value
                           and less authority. But, says Mr. Collier, inasmuch as they are in the folio of 1632,
                           which I now
                           give to the world, they are of authority paramount to any other suggestion or correction
                           that has
                           hitherto been made on the text of Shakespeare.

                        <p id="d56299e1954">Thus stood the question in 1853. How stands it a few years later? After a slow, but
                           gradual process
                           of growth and extension of doubt and questionings, more or less calculated to throw
                           discredit on the
                           authority of the marginal notes in the folio,—the volume being subjected to the careful
                           and

                           British Museum,—the result seems to threaten a considerable reduction in the supposed
                           value of the
                           authority which the public was called upon to esteem so highly.

                           left the meaning barely perceptible through the confusion and obscurity of the expression.

                           this really seems a very unnecessary direction, inasmuch as the next very clearly
                           indicates that

                           think that his
                           resuming his magical robe was in any way necessary to account for the slumber which
                           overcomes
                           Miranda, 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"in spite of her interest in her father's story,"</quote> and which Mr. Collier says
                           the commentators have endeavoured to account for in various ways; but putting

                           commentators, and which Mr. Collier conjures by the stage-direction which makes Prospero
                           resume his
                           magic robe at a certain moment in order to put his daughter to sleep. Worthy Dr. Johnson,
                           who was
                           not among the puzzled commentators on this occasion, suggests, very agreeably to common
                           sense, that
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="123" data-tei-n="117"> </a></span>

                           </quote> But Mr. Collier says the Doctor gives this very reasonable explanation of
                           Miranda's sleep only because he was not acquainted with the folio stage-direction
                           about Prospero's
                           coat, and knew no better. Now we are acquainted with this important addition to the
                           text, and yet
                           know no better than to agree with Dr. Johnson, that Miranda's slumbers were perfectly
                           to be
                           accounted for without the coat. Mr. Collier does not seem to know that a deeper and
                           heavier desire
                           to sleep follows upon the overstrained exercise of excited attention than on the weariness
                           of a dull
                           and uninteresting appeal to it.

                           the recital
                           itself, which is considerable—and, above all, the poignant personal interest of its
                           details, are
                           quite sufficient to account for the sudden utter prostration of her overstrained faculties

                           authoritative will and eyes of her lord and father, bowed down the child's drooping

                           that Miranda remained standing, in spite of her father's command? Moreover, when he
                           interrupts his
                           story with the words,

                           who objected, perhaps not without reason, to hearing the word "aches" pronounced as
                           a dissyllable,
                           although the line imperatively demands it; and Shakespeare shows that the word was
                           not unusually so
                           pronounced, as he introduces it with the same quantity in the prose dialogue of "Much
                           Ado about
                           Nothing," and makes it the vehicle of a pun which certainly argues that it was familiar
                           to the
                           public ear as

                           memory conjures up a vision of a stately drawing-room on the ground-floor of a house,
                           doubtless long
                           since swept from the face of the earth by the encroaching tide of new houses and streets

                           submerged every trace of suburban beauty, picturesqueness, or rural privacy in the
                           neighbourhood of
                           London, converting it all by a hideous process of assimilation into more London, till

                           between Lee and Blackheath, stood in the midst of well-kept grounds a goodly mansion,
                           which held
                           this pleasant room. It was always light and cheerful and warm, for the three windows
                           down to the
                           broad gravel-walk before it faced south; and though the lawn was darkened just in
                           front of them by
                           two magnificent yew-trees, the atmosphere of the room itself, in its silent, sunny
                           loftiness, was at
                           once gay and solemn to my small imagination and senses,—much as the interior of Saint

                           Rome has been since to them. Wonderful, large, tall jars of precious old china stood
                           in each window,
                           and my nose was just on a level with the wide necks, whence issued the mellowest smell
                           of fragrant

                           carpet, in which my feet seemed to me buried, as in woodland moss, I used to be brought
                           for the
                           recompense of "having been very good," and there I used to find a lovely-looking lady,

                           bore a sweet Italian diminutive for her Christian name, added to one of the noblest

                           of Venice, which was that of her family.

                           a man in the full flower of vigorous manhood. His attitude was one of miserable dejection,

                           remoteness of the scene from all known localities allows a range to the imagination
                           such as no other
                           of his plays affords—not even the

                           <hi id="d56299e2599" style="font-style: italic;">dramatic personæ</hi> are half of them superhuman, the scene is laid in a wood "near
                           Athens;" and Theseus and Hypolita, if fabulous folk, are among the mythological acquaintance
                           of our
                           earliest school days.

                        <p id="d56299e2603">But the

                           events than to any action in the play itself, which involves but few incidents, and
                           has little to do
                           with common experience.

                        <p id="d56299e2612">But chiefly I delight in this play, because of the image which it presents to my mind
                           of the glorious
                           supremacy of the righteous human soul over all things by which it is surrounded. Prospero
                           is to me
                           the representative of wise and virtuous manhood, in its true relation to the combined
                           elements of
                           existence—the physical powers of the external world, and the varieties of character
                           with which it
                           comes into voluntary, accidental, or enforced contact.

                           ethereal extreme,
                           Prospero is the middle link. He—the wise and good man—is the ruling power, to whom
                           the whole series
                           is subject.

                           animal propensities of the nature of man, which he, the type of its noblest development,
                           holds in
                           lordly subjugation.

                           under the wholesome restraint of a wise discipline can be gradually admonished into
                           the salutary

                           treacherous
                           worldlings—Princes and Potentates —the peers in outward circumstances of high birth
                           and breeding of
                           the noble Prospero— whose villanous policy (not unaided by his own dereliction of

                           truth and virtue in his person.

                           of
                           Sebastian and Antonio, and discovers the clumsy plot of the beast Caliban —he wields
                           immediate
                           influence over the elements, and comprehends alike without indignation or sympathy—which

                           results —the sin and suffering of humanity. Therefore, because he is only a spirit

                           the fulfilment of its duties, yearns after it with the tearful eyes of tender human
                           love when its

                           the table all the trenchers used upon it. The omission is a decided improvement, I

                           be found also in Hanmer.

                           says is the usual reading of the passage. But Mr. Theobald's suggestion of reading
                           it "Most busy
                           less" (i.e. least oppressed or absorbed with business) has been adopted by almost
                           all subsequent
                           editors. Of this decided improvement on the original text Mr. Collier takes no notice,
                           though it
                           involves but the change of one letter, but strongly commends the reading given in
                           his corrected

                           the right reading <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="152" data-tei-n="146"> </a></span> of the passage corrupted by the accidental

                           <hi id="d56299e2921" style="font-style: italic;">b</hi> for two centuries and a half. I cannot at all agree that
                           this alteration is superior to Theobald's; the sense is more obscure, and the line
                           is rendered harsh
                           and ungraceful by the abrupt break in it; whereas in Theobald's version the line is
                           smooth to the
                           tongue, and quite as intelligible to the comprehension: while Sir Thomas Hanmer gives
                           a far bolder
                           departure from the text, and not satisfied with changing one letter, alters the word

                           the earliest

                           been satisfied with, that "third" in the old folio is simply an obsolete way of spelling

                           word was certainly uncommon even in Shakespeare's time, the passage becomes tautological,

                           rather prosaically agricultural, by this admission of a second word, "tilled," having
                           so nearly the
                           meaning of the first. Shakespeare is not apt to be so poor in resources; some commentators
                           insist
                           that twilled means twill pants, some species of flower, of which we have lost either
                           the kind, or
                           this denomination; others convert the line into "peonied and lilied," giving many
                           learned references
                           to the chaste virtues supposed to reside in peonies and lilies; and Sir Thomas Hanmer,

                           perhaps some theory of his own to warrant the introduction of the gaudiest of Flora's

                           version was
                           given by Mr. Holt merely as a conjecture, and Steevens gives the line so corrected
                           to him in one of
                           his notes. Upon the whole, the pleasantest, and therefore the best emendation of the
                           line, when all
                           are equally uncertain, seems that which matches best with the tone and colouring of
                           the rest of the
                           picture, and the peonied and lilied banks betrimmed by spongy April, are better in
                           this respect than
                           anything else offered to Shakespeare's readers by the painful industry of his commentators.

                        <p id="d56299e2986">Of the blessing pronounced upon Ferdinand and Miranda, all the lines were originally
                           attributed to
                           Juno. Theobald, with nice poetical discrimination, gives the latter portion of them
                           to Ceres, a
                           change in which Sir Thomas Han- <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="156" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span> mer and all subsequent editors
                           coincide. Mr. Collier's folio, however, adheres to the original text in this particular;
                           and the
                           general character of these emendations perhaps accounts sufficiently for this not
                           being found among
                           them, suggested as it is, more by poetical feeling than critical acumen: whoever the
                           unknown
                           commentator was, he was assuredly not a poet. Farther on, the folio alters the lines—

                           which Mr. Collier pronounces "important," but which seems to me anything but an improvement.
                           It is
                           very true, that rain before the 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"very end of harvest"</quote> would be unwelcome, but in that
                           sense the line ought to be—"Rain come to you at the 
                           <hi id="d56299e3009" style="font-style: italic;">earliest</hi>"—not at the

                           I think the passage simply means that spring shall rapidly succeed autumn, leaving
                           the dreary winter
                           out of the calendar, a blessing Shakespeare has borrowed <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="157" data-tei-n="151"> </a></span> from

                           treasure of our tongue, the English Bible. It has been a question how much of Greek—if
                           any— how much
                           of Latin, and the modern French and Italian languages, our great dramatist pos- sessed;
                           and little
                           proof can be found of his having anything but the most superficial acquaintance with

                           expression of
                           our Bible. And strange to say, an intimate familiarity with the peculiar characteristics
                           of its
                           language is infinitely more perceptible in his profane (not to use the word in any

                           purely biblical,
                           the style seldom, if ever, recalls that of the Bible; while in reading his noble Jewish

                           the Samson, the Greek dramatists occur to us half a dozen times for once that we are
                           reminded of the
                           wild story of the Israelitish hero and his Philistian persecutors as it stands in

                           but, poet,
                           philosopher, and playwright as he was, your dealings with him are in the latter capacity
                           only. You
                           need not be afraid of eliminating the two nobler elements of his works; omit what

                           from the errors of his time and place. As for occasional breaking of his lines, my

                           redeem a faulty line, in some measure, by his utterance.
