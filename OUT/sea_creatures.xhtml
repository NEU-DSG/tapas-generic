                           <l>When the tide goes out and the glass creatures are left behind on the beach sand,
                              their surfaces dessicate and rupture. They absorb light into the pores and hollows
                              of their skin, where it concentrates and granulates as their colors darken.

                           <l>When the sun is low and its light is thick and soft and indirect, the glass creatures
                              float above the surface of the water, lapping its ripples with their own, lit from

                           <l>At dusk, the sun shows as an afterthought and the glass creatures are free to move
                              between air and water. They rise, dripping light, and skim across the boundary layer;
                              when they dive, they carry layers of light with them that disperse from their…

                              the darkness of the water with them, its saturated colors.
