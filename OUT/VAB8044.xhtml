                              about anything. It is hard to say whether it were
                              more painful for their friends to hear them

                              herself. When she was yet a bride, and young and
                              timid, she used to collapse when 
                              <persName id="d74180e877" corresp="#MrSkra">Mr. Skratdj</persName>
                              contradicted her statements, and set her stories
                              straight in, public. Then she hardly ever opened
                              her lips without disappearing under the domestic
                              extinguisher. But in the course of fifteen years
                              she had learned that 
                              <persName id="d74180e880" corresp="#MrSkra">Mr. Skratdj</persName>'s bark was a great deal
                              worse than his bite. (If, indeed, he had a bite at
                              all.) Thus snubs that made other people's ears
                              tingle, had no effect whatever on the lady to whom
                              they were addressed, for she knew exactly what
                              they were worth, and had by this time become
                              fairly adept at snapping in return. In the days
                              when she succumbed she was occasionally unhappy,
                              but now she and her husband understood each other,
                              and having agreed to differ, they unfortunately
                              agreed also to differ in public.

                              nature, and in no way affected the friendly tenour
                              of their domestic relations. They would interfere
                              with each other's conversation, contradicting
                              assertions, and disputing conclusions for a whole
                              evening; and then, when all the world and his wife

                              must blaze up into a flaming quarrel as soon as
                              they were alone, they would bowl amicably home in

                              at a distance did not mind so much. A domestic

                                    gentlewoman of small means; but she was
                                    accomplished. She could make very spirited
                                    sketches, and knew how to colour them after they
                                    were outlined and shaded in Indian ink. She had a
                                    pleasant talent for versifying. She was very
                                    industrious. I have it from her own lips that she
                                    copied the figures in my picture-book from prints
                                    in several different houses at which she visited.
                                    They were fancy portraits of characters, most of
                                    which were familiar to my mind. There were Guy
                                    Fawkes, Punch, his then Majesty the King, Bogy,
                                    the Man in the Moon, the Clerk ot the Weather
                                    Office, a Dunce, and Old Father Christmas. Beneath

                                    ingenious. She had been mainly guided in her

                                    happened to meet with, as she did not trust
                                    herself to design a figure. But if she could not
                                    get exactly what she wanted, she had a clever
                                    knack or tracing an outline of the attitude from

                                    a Christmas tree was very pretty; and the flames
