                        <p id="d145488e199">Benjamin West, born in what is now Swarthmore in 1738, is at last being honoured by
                           a comprehensive exhibition. To celebrate the bicentenary of his birth, the Philadelphia
                           Museum of Art will show, 
                           <date id="d145488e201" when="--03-05">March 5</date> to 
                           <date id="d145488e204" when="--04-10">April 10</date>, some sixty pictures, representing all phases of the painter’s work, a score of drawings
                           and water colors, and a number of engravings made after paintings by West.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e208">Benjamin West was a precocious child, starting to paint landscapes and portraits when
                           he was only nine or ten years old. For a while he lived in Lancaster, but soon moved
                           to Philadelphia, where he entered the College and Academy of Philadelphia, now the
                           University of Pennsylvania. At this time he became a great friend of the Rev. William
                           Smith, first Provost of the University. One of West’s earliest works is a portrait
                           of this teacher. West lived in this city until 1758 when he went to New York as a
                           portrait painter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e211">Anxious to study art in Italy, he secured passage on a ship sailing from Philadelphia
                           to Leghorn, and arrived in Rome in 
                           <date id="d145488e213" when="1760-07">July 1760</date>. West did but few paintings in Italy. Among them was a portrait of a Mr. Robinson
                           which was mistaken for an exceptionally fine work by the then popular Raphael Mengs,
                           with whom West had worked more or less in competition.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e218">Finally, in late 
                           <date id="d145488e220" when="1763-08">August, 1763</date>, West went to England and had almost immediate success. Introduced to George III
                           by his friend and patron the Archbishop of York, West was given many important commissions
                           and was made Historical Painter to His Majesty. With Sir Joshua Reynolds, he was one
                           of the founders of the Royal Academy, of which he was made president after Reynold’s
                           death.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e224">Benjamin West’s influence was felt in American painting in two major ways—his innovations
                           as an historical painter and his teaching. In his historical works, West was always
                           careful to obtain complete accuracy as to costume and settings. In the famous “Death
                           of General Wolfe”, Wolfe and his aides were attired in the correct military uniforms
                           of their day. Again, Penn, the Indians, and Penn’s company in “Penn’s Treaty with
                           the Indians” wear clothes suitable for the time of the incident. This practice was
                           of course in direct opposition to that of most contemporary painters who especially
                           in historical subjects, draped all figures in the multiple folds of classic Greece
                           or Rome. Sir Joshua Reynolds in particular objected when he heard of West’s intention
                           for the “Death of General Wolfe”, predicting complete failure for the picture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e227">As a teacher West’s influence was enormous. Numerous young American painters of the
                           day flocked to London, that they might study under their famous compatriot, among
                           them Gilbert Stuart, Matthew Pratt, Joseph Wright, John Trumbull, Washington Allston,
                           and Ralph Earle. Matthew Pratt painted West in his London studio surrounded by students
                           at their work. This picture, “American School”, will be lent to the exhibition by
                           the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e230">The West Bicentenary Exhibition has been drawn from the collections of fourteen museums,
                           eighteen private collections, and several collections of dealers. Among the more notable
                           pictures included in the show are the “Conference of the Treaty of Peace with England”,
                           portraits of West’s aged father and of his half-brother, the “Death of General Wolfe”,
                           “Penn’s Treaty with the Indians”, the three portrait groups of the Drummond family,
                           and several recently discovered paintings done during the artist’s childhood, and
                           belonging to the Pennsylvania Hospital. The self-portrait reproduced here is the property
                           of William Gray Warden of Philadelphia.

                        <p id="d145488e239">The designer and the producer have at last united for the benefit of the average consumer.
                           At least this is the outstanding impression one receives of “Design for Mass Production”,
                           now at the Art Alliance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e242">This exhibition displays the modern use made of plastics, glass, ceramics, textiles,
                           metals, woods, and papers, a use which always takes into account not only the function
                           of the article but the nature of the material itself.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e245">Contemporary designers now realize that while they may still turn to the past for
                           pattern and shape inspiration, qualities inherent in some of the new materials offer
                           even greater design possibilities. An example can be found in synthetic leathers,
                           such as fabrikoid. Until recently the main object was to imitate real leather. Being
                           an imitation, such products were thought suitable only for second-rate articles. Today
                           these synthetic fabrics are being used for anything for which their peculiar qualities
                           fit them. It is realized that, say fabrikona, has possibilities for wall-covering
                           that other materials lack. The designer recognizes these individual qualities and
                           turns them to decorative as well as functional use. Again, linoleum is no longer confined
                           to the kitchen but in its new forms is employed wherever its durability and variety
                           of color and surface is needed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e248">Two of the finest displays are those of glass and wall-paper. In the paper exhibit
                           are shown the various stages in printing a floral paper; a lay-out of wall-papers
                           for a typical six-room house; and various washable wall-papers. The uses of modern
                           glass range from bricks for buildings to door-knobs, to perfume bottles. Examples
                           of each of these and of many other uses are grouped in the glass section.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e252">This exhibition demonstrates above all that the designer of today must not only know
                           the function of the machine which is to reproduce his design in mass quantity, but,
                           what is even more important, he must have a complete knowledge of his materials. As
                           the old craftsman studied wood, its grains and wearing qualities, so the new designer
                           must know intimately the possibilities of the metals, plastics, synthetic fabrics,
                           etc. The fundamentals of design have not changed, but the methods have.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e255">This exhibition was arranged under the general direction of Clyde Shuler, chairman
                           of the Crafts Committee of the Art Alliance. He was assisted by a group of experts
                           in the various fields. Henry Hagert supervised metals and plastics; Duncan Niles Terry,
                           glass; Roy Requa, ceramics; Henry Allman, paper; Cynthia Iliff, fabrics; and W. Singerly
                           Smith, woods. The architect for the exhibition was Lloyd Malkus.

                           that he thinks more of them than he did when he first visited the institution.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e296">He sees saints, sinners, landscapes, still lifes, nudes and cracked portraits. Occasionally
                           his attention is drawn to a modern canvas that he doesn’t quite understand. Nevertheless,
                           he is fascinated by it all. He is very careful to make no noise—it would seem sacrilegious
                           with all that marble about. Then again there are the guards, and no matter how great
                           the thrill he receives in a museum, he has never felt completely at ease there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e299">Even so, he may visit such a sanctuary many times without once seeing the inside of
                           a privately conducted gallery. This should logically make the museum greater as an
                           influence, which, at the moment it may be with the layman.

                        <p id="d145488e302">In consideration of this, it is to regretted that so comparatively little living American
                           art can be seen on these visits. It is due largely to the fact that the vast majority
                           of bequests are collections of foreign art, and purchase funds stipulate the acquisition
                           of old masters rather than our own artists. The exceptions are not sufficiently numerous.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e305">In Philadelphia, the Johnson Collection, the Wilstach Collection and the Pennsylvania
                           Academy’s Permanent Collection contain many notable achievements of the past, and
                           we make no effort to detract from their artistic and cultural importance. But, numerically,
                           it far overshadows our local collections of living American art. Various funds established
                           in Philadelphia, the Lambert Fund, Fellowship Purchase Fund and others, are but a
                           few of the many we should have for the purpose of acquiring the work of our artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e308">Exhibitions held in various museums, such as the Carnegie International and others
                           sponsored by the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Pennsylvania
                           Academy and the like, have done much to encourage recognition of artists and the purchase
                           of their works. However, the major portion of our artists do not profit materially
                           by this. Incidentally, museums frequently buy for less than the artist’s original
                           price.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e311">It is here that the privately operated gallery enters the scene as the American artist’s
                           most practical aid to success, and this we shall consider subsequently.

                        <p id="d145488e315">Leonid Gechtoff, whose exhibit of paintings is current at the Sketch Club, has the
                           distinction of possessing two absolutely distinct artistic personalities.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e318">One, which might be called the more conservative, is well known to those who have
                           observed the output of this painter for a number of years. Here he regards almost
                           entirely landscape and still life, interpreting both with great technical freedom
                           and thick impasto, no less than color as vivid as it is personal. We recall as his
                           most impressive efforts in this direction some paintings of banyan trees exhibited
                           in Philadelphia a few years ago; it is regrettable that there are none included in
                           this show—they were beautiful weddings of manner and matter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e321">However, Gechtoff has retained his essential ruggedness in this group of oils, the
                           most effective of which are “Autumn” and “Twilight”, both vigorous, but decorative
                           in quality, and in unusual color keys.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e324">We now come to what the painter terms his “American phase”, as completely removed
                           from the other pictures as night from day. In these the artist has forsaken oil, except
                           in one instance, utilizing pastel instead. Furthermore, thick, luscious application
                           of paint has been replaced by a process of thin glazing, and composition, while built
                           upon normal pictorial, and sometimes romantic lines, is achieved by means of mechanical
                           lines, angles and circles. Gechtoff’s color, too, has undergone something of a transformation,
                           due not only to his new type of picture, but the change of medium.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e327">The most remarkable example of the “American phase” is a large portrait of S. P. Reimann,
                           M. D., in which the artist has incorporated various private enthusiasms of the doctor.
                           There is the central portrait head, around which has been introduced, among other
                           things, hands playing the piano, a palette and brushes, a bottle, a crab (to indicate
                           the cancer specialist), the modest building where Dr. Reimann’s cancer research was
                           pursued, and similar pictorial suggestions. The mechanical linear basis is reinforced
                           by opalescent color tone and is, incidentally, executed in the unusual combination
                           of oil and pastel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e330">A portrait of Natol Sussanne is accomplished in similar fashion minus the symbolism,
                           and a head of F. W. Weber shines forth through a maze of concentric circles and bold
                           angles.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e334">Various other smaller pastels, such as “Mechanical Modanna”, “Repeating”, “The Beginning
                           of a Fugue”, “Eyes of Dots”, “Aviation” and “Rhythm” are particularly expressive and
                           according to the artist are divided into objective and subjective categories.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e337">We are told that Gechtoff was presented to Vincent Van Gogh at a most tender age—in
                           which case a vivid memory of the event must have been the result, for this artist’s
                           painting of Vincent indicates much understanding for, and sympathy with, that great,
                           mad, pigmental personality.

                        <p id="d145488e348">Roberta Burbridge, who is exhibiting a group of twenty-eight oils at the Warwick Galleries,
                           possesses a palette of extraordinary tonal delicacy, combined strangely but effectively
                           with bold conception of line and volume.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e351">Compositionally, Miss Burbridge’s paintings are given to exceptional simplicity. Unimportant
                           details have been ruthlessly eliminated, notably in studies of nudes, with striking
                           result.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e354">One of the best examples of this is “Fantasy”, a female nude reduced anatomically
                           to its simplest expression, limbs co-ordinating admirably with the model’s long, scroll-like
                           hair.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e358">“Backyard” and “New Jersey Jungle” are among the best canvases. The former is of fine,
                           warm tone, volumes well selected and composed—the latter unusual with its reinforcement
                           of static areas at the top, bottom and side of the picture, an agreeable contrast
                           to the fluid masses of foliage within.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e361">“Negress #1” has great fullness of form and a wealth of color suggestion in its soft
                           flesh. “Landscape” (number 21 in the catalogue), is an exceedingly dramatic and compelling
                           piece of painting—of inordinate depth but devoid of sweetness in any sense.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e364">It is in floral studies that the artist achieves her lightest brushstroke and most
                           luminous color, qualities that are likewise pre-eminent in her still life of grapes
                           and peppers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e367">Withal, these paintings reveal definite, and admirable, individuality—they constitute
                           an exhibition well worth seeing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e370">Being given occasionally to an introspective mood, we sit alone in a corner, stroke
                           our long, white beard, and think what might have been if what was was not. For example,
                           if the world’s first mighty pawnbrokers, the family Di Medici, had been in the habit
                           of advertising, would Michelangelo have drawn illustrations for them?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e373">Undoubtedly, say we. Possibly that flower of the Renaissance would have accomplished
                           his task as a “tradesman”—but was it not in a similar capacity that he covered the
                           Sistine Chapel with timeless murals?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e377">As a “tradesman” be it—from both Daumier and Hogarth comes ample evidence of the artist’s
                           boon to commerce, and so it proceeds to our own day.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e380">The Print Club, in sponsoring an exhibition of book, magazine and advertising illustration,
                           lends considerable impetus to the theory that much genuine “fine art” is being executed
                           for commercial purposes. There are a number of contributions to this show that would
                           do credit to any water color exhibition.

                        <p id="d145488e383">Peter Helck was awarded a prize of $100.00 for “Plowing”, a drawing in ink and wash.
                           Honorable Mentions went to Pierre Brissaud for a water color: “Picnic in South Carolina”,
                           Robert Fawcett for a gouache: “Haunted House”, and Fred Ludekens for “In the Valley
                           of Mexico”, a lithograph. The jury was composed of Charles T. Coiner, Henry C. Pitz,
                           Joseph P. Sims, Edward Warwick and N. C. Wyeth.

                        <p id="d145488e386">The Helck and Brissaud contributions are particularly potent—the former crisply handled,
                           well composed and of enormous color suggestion, despite its lack of actual color—the
                           latter soft, decorative and possessed of a charm quite akin to that of an old French
                           print.

                           shown at the Carlen Galleries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e396">Spruance lithographs have long been one of our enthusiasms. With a bold vision and
                           an eye sensitive to the sparkle of light and the beauty of motion he has placed his
                           art upon stone in a peculiarly pure technical manner. In these, his most recent prints,
                           we find greater compositional and tonal strength, but more particularly an increasing
                           interest in the social problem.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e399">The artist’s most notable contribution to the present show is a series of four large
                           prints known as “The People Work”. To date it is certainly Spruance’s greatest accomplishment
                           in print-making. All are literal cross-sections of city streets and subways crowded
                           with workers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e402">The first is “Morning”, an example of magnificent figure grouping, in which the great
                           mass of American toilers pack stairway, platform and subway car. “Noon” is a busy
                           city street with men working below in a building excavation. “Evening” is another
                           composition of busy traffic on the street and beneath in the subway. The last, “Night”,
                           reveals some of our workers at play, others at their nocturnal tasks.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e405">The most remarkable quality of these prints is the achievement of introspection by
                           purely material, rather than poetic or mystic means.

                        <p id="d145488e408">There are a number of prints inspired by the motor car, as an agent of speed and a
                           menace to life. The swift motion of the machines is patently expressed and, in Spruance’s
                           eyes, motors become monsters, with Death lurking above them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e411">Much the same sense of motion is embodied in the prints of football subjects, seemingly
                           a favorite of the artist and powerful in effect. The industrial comments are spacious,
                           voluminous and treated with considerable crispness. It is in the delineation of quaint
                           buildings that Spruance permits the play of his phantasy. They have an eerie, sometimes
                           surrealistic, quality, and are frequently reminiscent of the poetry of Poe. Several
                           prints that comment upon the more sordid variety of humanity complete the exhibit.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d145488e440">Until some of the questions posed by the Coffee Bill controversy are answered, the
                           problem of setting up a Federal Arts Bureau which will foster American culture over
                           a long period cannot be solved.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e443">As now proposed, the Bureau would be a permanent continuance, with minor improvements,
                           of the Federal Arts Projects under W.P.A. These projects, according to the bill, would
                           be augmented to give employment to as many artists as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e446">The administrators of the bureau would be appointed from panels of names submitted
                           by organizations representing the greatest number of artists employed under the Bureau.
                           This, as we pointed out in an earlier editorial, would not be democratic representation
                           of the cultural elements of our society.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e450">Hence arise the questions:</p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e453">What, specifically, are the cultural elements of society which should be represented
                           in the choice of administrators?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e456">Would they not comprise art organizations and art schools now existing? If so, what
                           is a bona fide art organization or art school?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e459">If projects similar to those under W.P.A. are continued, what will become of the vast
                           number of pictures produced under the Bureau? What effect will this great picture-production
                           have on the art market for non-government artists? Art must have financial support.
                           Can the bureau encourage the patronage of art by the production and exhibition of
                           countless pictures?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e462">Taking the long view, art needs general patronage more than it does government support
                           for a few of its practitioners. Therefore, the Bureau should not spring out of a temporary
                           relief measure. It should be completely rewritten around a bigger and more constructive
                           idea. Its preamble should outline its chief aim with greatest clarity. That aim should
                           be the education of the public in appreciation of American Art as a whole, and the
                           stimulation of popular financial patronage of art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e465">The bureau should consist of administrators and workers who can carry out this aim,
                           persons who might well be expert advertisers and merchandisers rather than painters
                           of easel pictures.

                        <p id="d145488e736">Beset with a romanticised realism, a large section of American painting has, in recent
                           years, seemed singularly devoid of imagination. This long absent quality has, however,
                           returned in strength in the painting of Natol Sussanne and Ross Braught, who recently
                           held one-man shows at the Findlay and Ferargil Galleries in New York. Mr. Braught
                           is a former Philadelphian and Mr. Sussanne is now making this city his home. Both
                           are symbolic painters, recreating not only the physical world in which they live but
                           attempting by means of significant imagery to give substance to the inner world of
                           mind and heart.

                        <p id="d145488e748">Natol Sussanne is a painter of tumultuous life, expressing his conceptions with energy
                           of form and color. The seed and the plant, the child and the man, the earth from which
                           all rise—these are the subjects of his art, made apparent in swirls of color. Reds,
                           blues, yellows, greens of unbelievable brilliance testify to Sussanne’s belief that
                           life is essentially an exciting if mysterious experience.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e751">The symbolism with which he presents this belief is equally as rich as the color.
                           “Seed” is an attempt to encompass the mystery of creation. A great, onion-shaped seed
                           fills the canvas, its roundness and strength but partially concealing the image of
                           man, for a human face is dimly perceptible in the center of the seed form. “Peasant”
                           shows a robust country girl, seated with her back to a window, through which one sees
                           a field rich with growth. Everything in the picture creates an impression of physical
                           luxuriance, an impression which is heightened by the symbolic painting out of the
                           girl’s face. In most of these paintings the color is used with a very special meaning.
                           The clear blood-red, present in so many, seems to typify for Sussanne, fecundity.
                           The stalwart girl in “Peasant” is limned with it; in the little landscape, “Western
                           Pennsylvania,” the very fields exude the blood color of fertility.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e754">The thirty-one canvases included in this exhibit showed Sussanne as a painter of very
                           decided if not completely determined power. As yet he is still somewhat of an eclectic,
                           adapting the strength of many different artists to his own needs. For “To the Earth”
                           and “Cross Roads” he has employed the short, vigorous strokes of Van Gogh; “Bayou
                           Breed” shows the influence of one of Picasso’s early phases with a flakey, almost
                           pastel-like use of pigment; “Under Water” recalls the reveries of Burne-Jones in theme
                           and treatment. Sussanne however, is a highly original artist, belonging to no “school”,
                           but rather feeling life intensely and interpreting these intense sensations imaginatively.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e757">Using muted color and smooth sensual painting somewhat in the manner of O’Keefe, Ross
                           Braught, former student at the P. A. F. A., presents a world of fantasy and fact welded
                           in the dream. Like Sussanne, but with a very different mode of expression, he also
                           brings to American painting the quality of an intense imagination.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e760">“Donatello in the Jungle” might be said to symbolize Braught’s own theory of the value
                           of the dream to art. The sculptor, lying on the lush jungle floor, dreams his creation,
                           a group of singers in white marble. Structurally, this painting displays Braught’s
                           very fine sense of composition, the design being two triangular masses, apex to apex,
                           the lower, the curved body of the dreaming sculptor, the upper, the white aura from
                           which his marble group takes shape. The painting itself, as on all his canvases, is
                           meticulous, the color, warm but subdued.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e763">Two scenes have evidently done much to formulate Braught’s work, the tropical luxuriance
                           of the south, and the rock and sand shapes of the western deserts and mountains. From
                           the first, he derived a series of highly stylized yet sensational flower and foliage
                           studies as well as the settings for other paintings. The second influence is dominant
                           in such paintings, as the symbolic “Tschaikowsky’s Sixth” in which a white dove flies
                           above a mauve, ridged desert.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e767">Even more than imaginative themes, religious themes have been lacking in most modern
                           painting, and here again Braught is an innovator. One of the outstanding pictures
                           in the exhibition was “Entombment,” a passionate realization of the burial of Christ.
                           In this painting one may also see the art of the past with which Braught is most akin,
                           that of Blake. Here are the same attenuated, rhythmic forms, the same white light
                           as focus, and the same mystic approach.
                        </p>

                           jolted, one fine Sunday in January, by the sight of a chain of protesting artists
                           marching in a picket line before the Greek serenity of the Art Museum.

                        <p id="d145488e787">Flaunting signs decrying the injustices committed by the powers that be—in this case
                           the Museum officials and the head of the local Federal Art Project—the pickets attended
                           the Museum every Sunday from 
                           <date id="d145488e789" when="--01-22">January 22</date> to the close of the WPA art exhibit yesterday.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e793">Abetted by Barnes Foundation students and Artists’ Union members, the pickets proclaimed
                           their grievances—that Mary Curran had withheld WPA art from the public too long, that
                           the show she selected was not representative, that the Museum was “a factory for frauds,”
                           etc., etc.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e797">Most picketing, if successfully strategized, results in terrorizing of the public.
                           The average man, whether or not he is in sympathy with the cause for the picket-procession,
                           is so intimidated at the thought of running the gauntlet of belligerents, that he
                           refrains from going into the marked spot. And here lies the novelty of the Museum
                           picketing. Although an endless line covered the foot of the wide steps, people did
                           go in,—in droves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e800">The record attendance at any Parkway Museum exhibit was that for the Van Gogh show,
                           which 29,306 persons saw in a three week period. Attendance at the WPA show, in one
                           month, was 29,914. All of which may go to prove that as far as the Museum is concerned,
                           both the Artists’ Union and the Barnes Foundation are merely sheep in wolves’ clothing.
                           Dr. Barnes may shout for more and still more pickets, as he did at a recent lecture,
                           Union members may surreptitiously give away pamphlets until the Parkway looks like
                           Wall Street during a victory parade, and still the Museum won’t mind. They knew all
                           along that Dr. Barnes and the Unionites were only fooling. Didn’t they draw the biggest
                           crowd in the Museum’s history?

                        <p id="d145488e803">N. B. It might be a fine thing for the Benjamin West Exhibit, if the D. A. R. and
                           Patriotic Sons of America would picket the Museum during March.

                           of murals which lined the walls of the room where the entertainment, “A Night On the
                           Air,” was given. Famous and infamous radio stars were expertly caricatured. Charlie
                           McCarthy sat on top of the world, surrounded by such celebrities as the Roosevelts,
                           Eddie Cantor, Laurel and Hardy, and the Lunts. One panel satirized the ado about Mae
                           West’s fatal radio appearance. Mae appeared in the embrace of the serpent, with a
                           delighted audience on one side, shocked spectators on the other.

                           exhibition. The paintings were chosen for their particular interest to music lovers.
                           They represent Miss Arnett’s interpretation of the music of various composers.

                        <p id="d145488e884">A young artist, who has since become successful and famous, visited the ranch of a
                           friend in Mexico. A large mound on the ranch attracted his curiosity and he excavated
                           thousands of choice Indian relics from it. His interest in such things grew and he
                           added to his collection until it became valuable. Few of his acquaintances shared
                           his enthusiasm.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e887">The growing demands of his profession weaned him away from archaeological considerations.
                           He packed his flints, obsidians, ornaments, pottery, and miniature grotesques in barrels
                           and put them in storage. His fondness for the collection even cooled to the point
                           where he engaged an agent who quickly sold it. Many years later, the painter received
                           a phone message from the buyer, whom he had never met, asking if he might call at
                           the studio to learn some facts about the Indian relics. When the gentleman arrived,
                           he immediately began to talk at great length about the collection. He ignored the
                           handsome painting on the easel and those about the walls and seemed oblivious of the
                           romantic atmosphere of the artist’s workshop. Finally he complained that his friends
                           did not appear to be interested in his hobby, but looked at the curios only out of
                           politeness. “Why did you sell the collection?” he asked.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e890">“Perhaps that same lack of interest from friends which you have mentioned had something
                           to do with it, but it was chiefly because I became occupied with other things which
                           seemed more important.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e893">“It’s curious, and a little discouraging,” remarked the collector, “that a man can’t
                           find much sympathy for his interests. Friends of mine who play golf will only talk
                           golf, and bridge players care for nothing but bridge. When I show them my Indian things
                           they look at me as though I were a nut!”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e897">“What you say is very true,” agreed the painter. “For instance you have been in my
                           studio for more than an hour and a half, and you haven’t indicated a single trace
                           of interest in anything I do here.”

                           wager. And probably your only impression of that relic of the Centennial is one of
                           the cluttered curios in great gloom.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e924">Much of the gloom remains, but partial order has come into Memorial Hall. And through
                           that order we can see a really splendid collection of sculpture, painting, and crafts.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e927">Occupying the main entrance hall is a collection of ceramics, sculpture, paintings,
                           and furniture from the far East. Here are many things of interest—four Chinese tile
                           plaques replete with Oriental suavity of line, chairs that belonged to mandarins and
                           emperors—but few of more interest than two porcelain vases from China. They are unquestionably
                           of Chinese workmanship, but the design is that of a Greek amphora. In their exposition
                           of the inter-influences between these two ancient civilizations they seem to typify
                           the internationalism of art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e931">In the rotunda, beneath the great dome of Memorial Hall, is grouped the museum’s collection
                           of plaster casts. Too often subject to aspersion such casts are frequently valuable
                           to the art student and teacher. They show, far more clearly than is possible by slides
                           or word-descriptions, the actual form and size of monumental sculpture. Nicolo Pisano’s
                           huge pulpit at Siena is reproduced here on full scale as is a typical Gothic tomb,
                           that of Archbishop Ernest of Saxony at Magdeburg, Germany. There are also a few original
                           pieces of sculpture, such as a stone sarcophagus from Syria.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e934">The main feature of Memorial Hall is, of course, the justly famous Wilstach Collection
                           of paintings. Unfortunately many of the pictures are poorly hung and the light is
                           not what it should be. But, in spite of such technical defects, the collection remains
                           one of the finest in the city.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e937">As in all nineteenth century collections, the good is juxtaposed with the bad. Happily,
                           in the case of the Wilstach group, the group is so very good, that we can endure walls
                           of mediocrity for the El Greco “Crucifixion”, Jordaens’ “Circe and Ulysses”, a small
                           Constable landscape, the Redfield, the Corot, the Monets, the delightful little winter-scenes
                           of the seventeenth century Dutch School. Masters of the American, Flemish, Dutch,
                           French, Italian, and English Schools are all represented in this group of paintings.

                        <p id="d145488e966">Henry McCarter told me, in 1924, “more can be learned from a day in the Johnson Collection
                           than can be remembered from travelling all Europe.” I started to learn.

                        <p id="d145488e969">“Gentlemen die as fast as the sun sets and men go into the quiet rooms they have left
                           and take out things whose acquisition has been an adventure. There is always something
                           cherished, something rare, when gentlemen die. But few have been the gentlemen whose
                           means permitted them to collect freely precious and beautiful objects.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e972">A board for slum clearance should immediately restore one house on South Broad Street;
                           to hang at least one chosen exhibit as John G. Johnson wished it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e975">Obviously the collector intended his paintings to represent complete schools; his
                           acquisitions clearly obey that plan. As an artist I gained a knowledge of Venetian
                           painting from the first floor room in his house, not to be got by any other means.
                           The cessation of “exhibits in rotation” left the work of that school in sight for
                           a decade. I went continually, hoping Monet and Degas might again be on view; but they
                           were not. I got to know a section of his notable gift quite well, with ten years spent
                           on a third of it all; studying some pictures as Johnson meant all should be studied.
                           Even without the “museum pieces”—gracing the “display galleries” at Fairmount, the
                           Venetians left at home were worth study, though values were shifted. Now, that house
                           near South Street shelters a sewing project, worthy enough if you wish to excuse the
                           abuse; but an El Greco “Christ” should drive out the money-changers we have with us
                           always.

                           Is the city aware of its possessions only as pigeon holes?

                        <p id="d145488e982">The Johnson Treasury, though you might not have noticed it, was a “Living Museum”.
                           Primitive and religious art gained especially in significance in that outmoded setting.
                           They had a blood-warming force, so near to modern realities. Time and mischance accomplished
                           a juxtaposition more remarkable than the “sewing machine and umbrella on a dissecting
                           table”. The thin, shrill life outside, intruding on all aesthetic thought, as did
                           also the derelict guards provided for the mansion, distracted less than one single
                           note of classicism might.

                        <p id="d145488e985">The sly canon behind his curtain, by Titian, was real there, and perturbed by the
                           street scene. The mystic anguish shown by Crivelli’s cherubs had a profounder pain,
                           contrasted by cries in the street where black babies play. And from a midpoint of
                           the stairs in that dark hall El Greco’s Christ became so astounding one could curse,
                           or pray; but not consider ine or color, “abstractly”, as in a museum. Rembrandt’s
                           slaughtered ox, so near to South Street, shone as a visual experience, not to be considered
                           a dilemma in taste. With removal of the paintings to the Museum, among the altered
                           meanings most evident is that of Breughel’s “Unfaithful Shepherd”.

                           to display its best fourth. Now that the house is far on the way to condemnation,
                           the vitiation of John G. Johnson’s will is complete.

                           <p id="d145488e1027">The palette of the painter at the time of the early Renaissance was rather limited.
                              His selection of colors was:

                           <p id="d145488e1036">VERMILION, chemically sulphide of mercury, is found native as mineral cinnabar in
                              Spain, China, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Germany, and California, but it is rarely found
                              sufficiently pure and bright in color in its natural state to be used as a pigment.
                              Vermilions have always occupied an important place on the palette and are valued even
                              today for their range of hues, being manufactured in cool bluish varieties to very
                              warm scarlet and orange tones. However, early painters soon observed the tendency
                              of vermilions to darken when subjected to prolonged direct sunlight exposure, a reaction
                              which is not chemical but photographic. Vermilions which for centuries had retained
                              their color in illuminated books and manuscripts have been known to darken when placed
                              in museums where they were subjected to direct sunlight. To counteract this change,
                              the early Dutch painters overglazed with Madder Lake, which acts as a filter screen
                              absorbing the actinic rays and retarding reaction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1039">Vermilions have been used from the very earliest times. Four hundred years B. C. the
                              Egyptians were known to have employed this pigment, while it is thought to have been
                              familiar to the Assyrians and Chinese at a still earlier date. . .

                           <p id="d145488e1042">RED LEAD, a bright red oxide of lead, was known to the Romans and Greeks as Minium,
                              (latin for Vermilion). Like the true vermilion, Red Lead is not stable under prolonged
                              direct sunlight exposure. In tempera and oil, where the pigment is better protected
                              by the vehicle and varnish, Red Lead is fairly permanent. But in such techniques as
                              water color and pastel, where it is less protected, Red Lead, like other pigments,
                              prepared from lead, is sensitive to certain sulphurous gases in the atmosphere and
                              turns black through conversion into the black sulphide of lead.

                        <p id="d145488e1069">In most progressive systems today, the curriculum is built around a core subject,
                           designed to fit locality or interest. The worthwhileness of such a system has yet
                           to be proved adequately, but those working in schools where it functions speak well
                           of the plan to date. Four to six more years of trial and experiment will show whether
                           this radical departure from mere subject teaching is to be desired or not. Many feel
                           that this system, or one stemming from it, will prove the answer to meeting the social
                           and cultural problems confronting the school of today. We talk of meeting these problems
                           in our meetings; we are aware only too well of their existence and yet, in practice,
                           do nothing or next to nothing to face them successfully.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e1072">Heretofore the core subject around which the whole curriculum of a system has been
                           built, has been some phase of the social sciences—that subject which covers a multitude
                           of courses, ranging from Medieval History to Social Hygiene. Here we have, to begin
                           with, that elastic quality of subject that will stretch in any direction indefinitely.
                           The fact that it is so pliant, defeats its purpose. Those teachers who care little
                           to change their particular rutted teaching techniques can, by half truth and rationalization,
                           justify their courses to their own satisfaction. If their supervisors and principles
                           also lack vision, they can proceed in the old way, talking progressively in their
                           meetings, but doing nothing in their classrooms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e1076">Too much of our “progressivism” is pure talk, reserved for meetings with other schoolmen,
                           or the university classroom, where we take courses to acquire degrees for mercenary
                           reasons. Supervision also is too often superficial. Our supervisors have long since
                           stopped teaching, and are impervious to the pulse beat of a classroom. They profess
                           satisfaction if they can see work being done and order being kept, too hurried to
                           do a good job, too lax to inquire, too satisfied by their position to bother, too
                           poorly prepared, perhaps, to know. But granting a progressive system and sympathetic
                           and directed supervision, can we go forward logically with an elastic center to our
                           course of study? Should not the core, the center, rather be firmly established? If
                           it is of sufficient worth, the implications it carries can be stretched to permeate
                           the system.

                        <p id="d145488e1079">Years ago, a great pioneer in the progressive movement, Dr. Frank Alonzo Hildebrand,
                           said that starting with the greatest of all the world problems as a basis for curriculum
                           building, we could not go wrong, and that that problem could permeate a whole system
                           from kindergarten through the twelfth grade, with enough left over for years of college
                           and graduate work. That world problem of his, and to him and many who have never heard
                           of him it is the greatest of world problems, was “The Home”.

                           the art teachers may be the means and the pivot around which such a system, with such

                           Faison took some fashion drawings to Ethel Traphagen, and it seems she made an unmentionable
                           ‘faux pas’ when she started to discuss price. A careful secretary, however, hovering
                           to the rear made several strange shushing motions, crimping Miriam’s attempts—which
                           she later learned was a good deed on the secretary’s part.

                           After his talk, Dr. Barnes complimented Mr. Hart because he had “committed criminal
                           libel three times” (not against Miss Curran). Following this statement, Barnes invited
                           a suit for criminal libel or for improper use of the mails, a practice in which he
                           proudly admitted his own indulgence. He believes such a suit would benefit the Friends
                           of Art.

                           of the need for State Aid to Local Schools. In opposition to the Mayor’s statement
                           that the Board of Education had built “marble palaces”, she cited the case of the
                           dingy Claghorn school which she said “should be torn down by a group of indignant

                        <p id="d145488e1421">Dr. Barnes complained that the local press more or less ignores these vital matters
                           of art and education. He gave reasons for the neglect of each of the daily papers,
                           but failed to mention the Philadelphia Art News, no doubt through an oversight.

                           and display work, is gradually coming into its own in all branches of art. It is used
                           to SPRAY on color instead of the usual brush application, and through it may be used
                           oil, water, or poster color. Adjustments on the nozzle permit it to come down to a
                           hair line or to cover as much as a square foot. Beautiful gradations of color from
                           dark to light are easily obtained. In many cases, only an air-brush can get the smooth
                           application necessary for reproduction. The usual method of supplying air pressure
                           has been hiring of carbonic gas tanks with regulating gauges. Wold Co. of Chicago
                           now has an electric compressor on the market, quiet in operation, adjustable gauge,
                           and makes enough air to keep three small or two medium air-brushes going evenly at
                           one time. It sells for $29.50.

                           yourself; Payons go on smoothly, blend well, cover each other without peeling or flaking.

                           of apple-paring; H. J. Phillips’ still-life showing a compact balancing of masses
                           and volumes in a platter, a compote of fruit, and a brass figurine; action shots of
                           wrestling and boxing by H. Crowell Pepper; a study in the texture of roof-shingles
                           made by F. S. Lincoln; Paul Darrow’s circus-pictures; these constitute but a fraction
                           of the subjects investigated and presented in artistic form.

                        <p id="d145488e1787">Many techniques and points of view were employed in this show, suggesting that the
                           modern photographer is almost as free in interpreting his vision as is the painter.
                           The surrealistic movement in painting is echoed in Ralph E. Day’s striking photograph
                           of two gloves, posed as if they were clasped hands. With dramatic realism Margaret
                           Bourke-White records southern tenant farmers. The juxtaposition of repeated mass and
                           line in Freeman P. Taylor’s camera-study of a Georgia pottery suggests the volume
                           patterns of the Cubists. F. Seymour Hersey’s flowerpiece two tulips, employs the discriminating
                           selection and simplicity of a Japanese print. The photographer does not, of course,
                           slavishly follow the modes of the painter, but he does reflect predominant currents
                           in contemporary art.

                           <p id="d145488e1848">Upon arriving home I was greeted with cable orders from New York to cover the sea
                              rescue of the British tanker Antinoë by the S. S. President Roosevelt in the Irish
                              Sea. Pausing long enough to reload my plateholders, and grabbing a toothbrush, I hied
                              me off to London town. Seven-fifteen P.M. found me at Victoria station with ample
                              time to catch the seven-fifty-five at Paddington Station for Queenstown, Ireland.
                              The rattler was crowded and overflowing with newspapermen, movie men, and still-cameramen
                              from all over Europe. Needless to say gaiety prevailed on that trip. The first thing
                              I did after arrival next morning at Queenstown, now called Cobh by all good Irishmen,
                              was to treat myself to a bath, and a haircut and shave by an Irish barber. The Roosevelt
                              was due off shore sometime that night so there was plenty of time to kill. I took
                              a jaunting car and surveyed the town. At lunchtime I queried some of the boys about
                              how they were going to send their stuff to America. They were planning on staying
                              with the ship to Southampton or Cherbourg, sending their pictures from that French
                              port the day after arrival there, aboard a French liner. We studied our steamship
                              schedules. They were our bibles. So I wandered about town visiting steamship offices,
                              and discovered that two slower boats left this port the next day. One made sixteen
                              knots an hour and the other eighteen. But with good weather they would reach the good
                              old U.S.A. ahead of the fast Cherbourg boat because of their three day start. I went
                              to one of the local Irish papers and hired a man to come aboard the Roosevelt with
                              me that night and return to Cobh with the lighter. He was to put whatever I gave him
                              aboard the two boats leaving the next morning.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1851">It was late that night when our lighter picked up the Roosevelt and the Irish sea
                              was still kicking up pretty rough. There was a grand free-for-all trying to get up
                              the narrow tossing companion ladder first. I went right for the ship’s photographer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1854">“Got any pictures?” I asked breathlessly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1857">He had. He showed me a beaut. Many good amateur photographers among the passengers
                              had shot plenty of good pictures showing the Antinoë foundering, with her decks awash
                              and lined with her half-naked crew, but they might have been enlarged from a pinpoint,
                              whereas this picture showed a portion of the Roosevelt deck in the foreground, thus
                              graphically illustrating the closeness of those two boats in the mountainous sea.
                              Topside on deck they were buying undeveloped rolls of films from passengers for one
                              hundred pounds a roll. Taking a chance.

                           <p id="d145488e1861">“How many prints have you got?” I asked.</p>

                           <p id="d145488e1870">“Sold.” He didn’t know the market above decks.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1873">“Give me the plate.” I demanded.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d145488e1876">He gave it to me. I smashed it beneath my heel to prevent further duplication falling
                              into rival hands, paid him off, and snatching the four precious prints ran up on deck.

                           The importance of this inner structure cannot be overstressed. It is the essence of
                           all the outward subtleties, reflecting and revealing the real meanings of the structural
                           foundation beneath, upon and from which all else is built. Expressing and interpreting
                           both the action and solidity of form is far more important than achieving a mere surface
                           map.

                           from the time worn “young bride preparing dinner” idea. Bill Sparks did the backgrounds

                        <p id="d145488e2005">Repeated visits to the magnificent Exposition of Decorative Arts in Paris in 1925
                           convinced me of the need of governmental representation in art in all of its forms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2008">Those handsome presentations from almost all countries of their finest decorative
                           arts were an unanswerable argument for some sort of machinery in this country which
                           would enable such displays, not only to be planned for long ahead, but to be assembled
                           with dignity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2011">When I asked why the United States was not represented, I was told that an invitation
                           had been extended, but was unaccepted because we had no governmental department to
                           organize a representative exhibition.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2015">The only other great power absent was Germany, who had not been invited.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2018">Even small countries like Iceland and Poland and a tiny principality like Monaco could
                           send an inspiring display of their best decorative work, housed in an original and
                           charming building, however small.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2021">This country has been powerfully influenced in all of its decorative arts, display,
                           sculpture, interior decoration, etc., by the ideas of artists and designers shown
                           at that exhibition.

                        <p id="d145488e2024">In 1931, the United States participated in the French Colonial Exhibition by sending
                           an inevitable replica of Mt. Vernon.

                        <p id="d145488e2027">Among the great variety of artists and designers in this country, there is certainly
                           enough imagination and originality, which, if co-ordinated, should result in a display
                           somewhat more striking and novel than a replica of Mt. Vernon.

                        <p id="d145488e2030">Paris has a school called, I think, “L’Ecole de la ville de Paris”, which is the means
                           for developing their highest type of artist-craftsmen. The requirements for entrance
                           are quite high, and the results, seen in their magnificent craftsmanship are an equally
                           unanswerable argument for a high standard of ability as a prerequisite for governmental
                           or municipal backing in the arts.

                           vitally necessary. Better no Federal Arts Act at all than the Act as first drafted.

                           (as well as his country) have official representation abroad and an exchange of art

                           of art constitutes a most vivid, enlightening commentary on the history of literature.
                           Through a personal experience . . . I have come to see how a knowledge of one supplements
                           a knowledge of the other, and intensifies the response which the individual is able

                        <p id="d145488e2068">With these sentences B. Sprague Allen opens his two volumes, “Tides in English Taste,”
                           (Harvard University Press, 1937.) Although it is primarily a work for students of
                           literature as the subtitle “A Background for the Study of Literature,” indicates,
                           it nevertheless provides much of vital interest for the art student. Here are presented
                           by means of detailed examples, the prevailing art trends in the late seventeenth and
                           eighteenth centuries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2071">Taking architecture, gardening, and the arts that are most closely allied to them
                           as the reflecting agents, Dr. Allen traces the ebb and flow, the surge and resurgence
                           of classicism and romanticism during these decades. And in so doing he presents us
                           with a new evaluation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—as centuries of
                           artistic complexity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2075">It has been the fashion as well as the convenience to consider the eighteenth century
                           as wholly dominated by the classic wit and rational brilliance of a Pope. The appearance
                           of a Blake, revealing so unmistakably influences from Gothic architecture and sculpture,
                           has been regarded as a complete aberration from type. Dr. Allen, however, makes us
                           realize that such Gothic tendencies were not spasmodic superficialities. Indeed, one
                           might almost say that the elements of gothicism or romanticism were as deeply a part
                           of the aggregate eighteenth century mind as were those of classicism. As early as
                           1656, at the very time when Palladianism was beginning on its long curve of favor,
                           there appeared Dugdale’s “Antiquities of Warwickshire”, a book which was to stimulate
                           enthusiasm in many persons for all traces of the Saxon, Norman, and Gothic periods
                           in England. Again, even while Evelyn and Wren were drawing up classically disciplined
                           plans for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire, there were many who lamented
                           the passing of the steep-gabled, top-heavy outlines of medieval architecture. The
                           two forces, classicism and gothicism, were equally interwoven into the pattern of
                           eighteenth century taste.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d145488e2078">Among the little explored influences on the art of those times are the currents which
                           came from the east—from Japan, India, and especially from China. In literature those
                           influences took the form of plots, settings, characters; in art, of architecture,
                           furniture, and general decoration. In the chapter “The Invasion of England by Oriental
                           Art,” Dr. Allen discusses the effect of these new tides of design, showing how the
                           “chinoiserie” with its exoticism, its different conceptions of pattern, its new color
                           combinations, substantially altered the trend of English artistry.

                           and architectural plans showing the reflections of these two main forces, classicism
                           and romanticism, should be of more than usual interest to anyone who wishes a cultural
                           and a social approach to the art of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England.

                           “art-conscious in terms of living artists,” Miss Taylor claims that these facts “seem
                           to ESCAPE artistic notice;” that the artist “objects to his art serving life,” “attaches
                           fabulous prices to his work that no average lawyer or doctor could meet,” and is unable
                           to accept criticism, thinking “mere mortals have no right to freedom of the press
                           where art is concerned.”

                        <p id="d145488e2096">Of the Federal Art Show at the Museum, Miss Taylor says, “Here is an almost even theme
                           of economic vagrancy. I wonder why these artists, subsidized by the people’s money,
                           (i.e., not F.D.R.’s or the government’s) can’t see beyond into the clear light of
                           life where the heroes or gods if you please earn their bread, and sometimes their
                           butter, direct from the people. I wonder when the artists will go human, nurture their
                           canvases with the juice of life itself.”
