                           who were going to seek work and homes and a brighter future than they could hope for
                           here. They were
                           accompanied by Mr. James Brace, an agent of the Children's Aid Society, but the expenses
                           of their
                           removal were defrayed by Mr. Whitelaw Reid, from funds which had been placed in his
                           hands by
                           charitable gentlemen to expend as he thought best in relieving the wants of the suffering
                           in New
                           York, with the requirement that what he did should be reported in detail in the Tribune.
                           The boys
                           who made up the party Tuesday are more than usually intelligent and thoughtful. Short
                           sketches of
                           the boys are given, their simple histories being related mainly in their own words."—[From

                              questions. I will ask mother, before I go, about father. Good-bye, sweet little Birdie;

                              never meet again, but I shall carry your precious image with me to my grave."

                           <said id="d196929e1333" who="#abclifford">"Joe, I have purposely avoided the subject because it was painful to me, but I
                              will now give you a sketch of my life and your birth. I was an only child; my parents
                              died and
                              left me in my infancy. My uncle received me into his family and cared for me until
                              I was
                              seventeen years of age. My aunt always begrudged me the kindness my uncle bestowed
                              upon me. In
                              my seventeenth year I met your father. It is the old-time story of woman's love and
                              trust and
                              man's treachery. He was much older than myself. He visited friends in the neighborhood
                              where I
                              lived, saw me, made love to me, and I, believing him, fled with him and was married
                              to him. He
                              afterwards told me it was only a mock marriage, as he already had a wife. I cursed
                              him and fled
                              from him. For awhile, I think, I must have been raving <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="7"> </a></span> mad. The
                              first I remember of was a cottage near New York, where I was cared for by your Aunt
                              Mary. Your
                              tiny head was nestled in my bosom, and I awoke to the consciousness that I was a mother
                              without
                              being a wife, and your only birthright a heritage of shame; a pauper born in a stranger's
                              home
                              and tended by the hand of charity; a homeless, nameless babe. I was kindly cared for
                              by your
                              Aunt Mary Grey, and when I was able to go out to work she took care of you; but for
                              her kindness
                              and help in my time of need I would have been taken to the hospital. I need not ask
                              you, my son,
                              to always care for your Aunt Mary. I know you will. Your earliest recollections are
                              of poverty
                              and privation, and yet I have every reason to believe your father a wealthy man. He
                              furnished
                              our home beautifully; for almost a year we lived, as I have sometimes imagined, the
                              sinless live
                              in paradise. After a time your father grew morose, and at times restless. He often
                              came home
                              under the influence of wine; at such times he would taunt me with infidelity and curse
                              women as
                              a class. I was heart-broken at first, but I urged him to give up wine; one day he
                              returned worse
                              than usual; he told me that I was not his wife, that he had a wife before ever he
                              saw me, and he
                              only made believe I was his wife, because I showed my preference for him so plain,
                              and was so
                              ready to elope with him. Oh! the misery, the suffering of that hour; the love of a
                              life time was
                              changed; the baleful burning fires of hate leaped to my eyes and scorched the red
                              blood in my
                              heart. Steadily, calmly, I stood before him, and told him I 
                              <hi id="d196929e1337" style="font-style: italic;">hated</hi> him; he had
                              betrayed me. I left then, there and forever, with a curse on my lips. Years have gone
                              by. I hid
                              my shame, my dishonored life, amid the strangers in New York city. The associates
                              of the
                              unfortunates are not particular in regard to character. No one inquired of me who
                              I was, or from
                              whence <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="8"> </a></span> I came. I was but a unit in the great mass of human kind
                              that drifts along the sea of time. I had done no willful sin. Day after day, I have
                              toiled on,
                              as only hopeless, helpless woman can toil, for our daily bread. I have never met Horace
                              Clifford
                              from that day until now. Sixteen long years have told their lengths; you are now entering
                              into
                              manhood's estate, and, my son, let your mother's suffering be a warning to you never
                              to trifle
                              with woman's affection. You do not resemble your father in feature and complexion,
                              but you have
                              his bearing, his manners, his expression. He was tall, dark and fine in appearance,
                              and I have
                              sometimes thought some deep trouble haunted him, which caused him to treat me so badly.
                              Should
                              you ever meet him and become known to him, treat him kindly for the sake of the love
                              I once gave

                           with a mournful
                           sadness in his eyes no words could express. He looked at the boys as they passed into
                           the train.
                           Suddenly he started and grew pale as Joe Clifford passed by him, entering the car.
                           His companion
                           noted his conduct and said:

                           westward course.
                           The opportunity was lost. The face that had haunted him for years had passed like
                           a phantom from his

                           his heart heavy with a sadness he could not express. His friend, Frank Throop, tried
                           to drive away
                           his gloom and sad feeling; he remarked to him:

                        <p id="d196929e1465">Horace answered impatiently: 
                           <said id="d196929e1467" who="#hclifford">"Do not talk to me of a wife. I drove my sweet
                              wife, my queenly Austria, from my home by cruel, unjust treatment. Oh, I thought to
                              try her
                              woman's love too far; fool, fool, that I was, I might have known she would suffer
                              death rather
                              than dishonor. I have cursed myself for years for that act. I was born to untold wealth;
                              I never
                              knew a wish which was not gratified. When I came to manhood's estate I was sought
                              after for my
                              wealth; I resolved to seek a wife in the humble walks of life, and one who would love
                              me for
                              myself. I found her in Austria Belmont; I married her and brought her from her humble
                              home in
                              New Hampshire to the city of New York. Here we lived a life of happiness, no language
                              can
                              express. She was an only <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="17" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span> child; her parents were dead. She was
                              of good family, but poor. She was a slave to her aunt, at the place where I boarded
                              one summer
                              mid the Hampshire hills. I knew her to be a lady. I brought her to Belmont cottage,
                              on the
                              Hudson; here for months we lived, happy as human beings ever are. I attended my club
                              as usual
                              one evening; the conversation turned upon 'woman's love.' A devil in human shape sneered
                              at
                              woman's love and said it was only a myth. I boastingly replied, that woman's love
                              once gained
                              could not be turned aside from its object. He replied:

                              but her love
                              will be turned to hate, and her sweetness to the bitterest gall.'

                           <said id="d196929e1481" who="#hclifford">"I refered him to cases where women had clung to men through the darkest
                              disgrace. He admitted that woman would share man's disgrace and love him, but she
                              would not
                              accept disgrace at man's hands and love him still. I was so confident of my power
                              to hold
                              Austria's affection under all circumstances, that I boasted I knew a woman whose love
                              would
                              stand anything for the man she loved. I had of late been drinking too much; the demon
                              drink held
                              me under its cursed power. I was mad, mad ever to treat her so. I drank more deeply,
                              and when I
                              returned home, often treated Austria badly. The curse of intemperance was over me;
                              the serpent
                              had entered our garden, nor would it stop until it had trailed its slimy length along
                              and left
                              destruction in its pathway. She would look at me with sadness and wonder in her beautiful
                              eyes,
                              but never reproach me. I have lain awake at night and listened to her praying for
                              me. My wicked
                              heart exulted when I thought, here is a true woman's love; nothing can drive her from
                              me or
                              change a love like hers. I <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="13"> </a></span> resolved to give her noble love one
                              more trial, and then tell her all, and take her to my elegant home in the city so
                              our child
                              would be born in the home of my father.

                              could have acted as I did. I entered our home sullenly; paid no attention to the delicate

                           Throop, and invited him to accompany him, which he readily consented to do. Frank

                           prevent his accompanying his friend on a trip west, therefore he readily consented.

                           charity, as he had ample means without making a charge of his patients. They agreed
                           to start on the

                              from her in a short time; the letter and trinkets she still kept, with the exception
                              on of a
                              small gold locket, containing the picture of Mrs. Kentrall and her brother. This locket
                              she had
                              put upon the neck of Mrs. Kentrall's child. This child she had always dressed as a
                              boy, and
                              turned it loose with the slums of New York's vilest street vermin. The child was known
                              by the
                              name of George Kent, and was now a boot-black some where in the city. She was sixteen
                              years of
                              age, with large, black eyes and close cut black curls; she was tanned, and had the
                              appearance of
                              a delicate boy. On her right arm, near the shoulder, was a crimson sear in the shape
                              of a letter
                              V; it was caused by her mother seeing a wound on a boy's arm cut as a letter V, by
                              falling on a
                              sharp iron instrument."

                        <p id="d196929e1606"> Dr. Throop listened, distressed and silent. When she had finished, she called for
                           a package that was
                           under her pillow; produced the letter and trinkets, and gave them to the justice.
                           He handed them to
                           the doctor, saying, "They belong to you." The doctor took them and, with trembling
                           fingers, opened
                           the letter, which read as follows:

                        <p id="d196929e1644">This was the letter his sister had written him sixteen years ago; her fingers had
                           long since crumbled
                           into dust; her dying request had been kept from her brother; and her child! where
                           was it to-day? Her
                           precious little baby a wandering vagrant in the streets of New York! He shuddered
                           at the thought of
                           what that innocent little girl would have to endure, cast out with the lowest of the
                           low—a helpless
                           waif in the vast ocean of humanity, that surged its foul slimes through the lairs
                           and haunts of New
                           York's crime-stained lower class. And yet, occasionally, you find a pure one there,
                           like a costly
                           jem surrounded with rubbish, gleaming out brighter for its humble setting. Such indeed,
                           was Georgia
                           Kentrall; but her uncle knew it not; and when the haggard old crone turned on him
                           her dying eyes and
                           said "forgive!" he ground his teeth to keep back the curse that arose to his lips.
                           He said to her
                           bitterly, 
                           <said id="d196929e1646" who="#fthroop">"It matters little for my forgiveness; ask God to pardon you. You
                              have sinned against a young and innocent life. I shall seek for my neice, poor little
                              darling;
                              she has been alone all these weary years."

                        <p id="d196929e1650">He grasped the letter and trinkets in his hand, and left the presence of the dying
                           woman, with an

                           there he found Horace anxiously studying the list of names again. Horace noticed Frank's
                           disturbed
                           appearance, and asked him the cause of it. He told him he had made the discovery that
                           his sister had
                           left a child, and that child had been cast out in the slums of New York's vilest haunts
                           for sixteen
                           long years.

                        <p id="d196929e1660"> Horace was grieved to be deprived of his friend's society, but could not give up
                           the search of the
                           face that looked so like his Austria's.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1663">While they sat conversing, Dr. Throop picked up the list of names and glanced carelessly
                           down the
                           column. He here discovered the name of George Kent, aged eleven years; slight form,
                           with black eyes
                           and hair; his parents were dead, and he had been a boot-black in New York before starting
                           for a home
                           in the west. Something in the description seemed to haunt him—slight form, with black
                           eyes and hair.
                           He startled Horace by exclaiming:

                        <p id="d196929e1734">Ah! weary, sunless days! How they sometimes creep into our lives, with their cheerless
                           shadows, and
                           leave us groping in the gloom of despair. The black mantle of desolation had unfurled
                           its funeral
                           pall and the sable plume hung dark over Austria's life. Day after day went by like
                           a dream. When she
                           left the presence of her husband she went out in the night and darkness, like some
                           wild creature
                           seeking shelter. She was mad with misery; deceived, betrayed by the man she loved,
                           she prayed for
                           death. Oh! the unspoken agony of a woman's heart mourning for the love that has proved
                           itself
                           worthless. Language fails to paint, and the human tongue to speak, the sorrows of
                           such a heart. She
                           seemed smitten with some terrible suffering. She wandered aimlessly along, neither
                           knowing nor
                           caring whither her steps led her; only one motive in view, and that was to escape
                           her misery. When
                           morning dawned she was found draggled and helpless on a door step, far out from the
                           city. It was a
                           cottage home occupied by a widow. She, too, had suffered, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span> as woman
                           must sometimes suter in this world, and her heart was tender for the sufferings of
                           others. The kind
                           hearted woman, seeing a sister in distress, asked no questions but kindly took her
                           into her humble
                           home, undid the costly dress, all torn and draggled; unlaced the fine boots and removed
                           them from
                           the tired feet; took from her neck an elegant gold watch and chain; bathed the hot
                           head and kindly
                           insisted she should lie down upon her bed and rest.

                        <p id="d196929e1739">Dazed and stricken with mighty suffering Austria obeyed her, without a word as to
                           who she was or
                           where she came from. For days she lay at death's door, raving madly in delirium. In
                           a few days her
                           babe was born; she was kindly cared for by Mrs. Grey. When she recovered, she was
                           as one without aim
                           or hope in life; she lived, but life was void of interest; she slept, but sleep was
                           only a rest of
                           overdone nature; she ate, but food was tasteless to her, and she seemed as one sorrowfully
                           stricken
                           in mind and body.

                        <p id="d196929e1743">Her babe was one month old when she accidentally overheard a conversation between
                           Mrs. Grey and a
                           neighbor. The neighbor said, "Mrs. Grey, I think it a little too hard for you to be
                           slaving to keep
                           that woman in idleness, who looks as if she was no better than she ought to be, here
                           a spongin' on
                           you in her idleness; you toil dar and night for what you eat."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1746">Mrs. Grey's kind voice interposed, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e1748" who="#mgrey">"Do not speak so; I know the lady has
                              met with some terrible misfortune, or she never would have been in the condition she
                              now
                              is."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1751">The words seemed to rouse Austria to a sense of her duty. When Mrs. Grey came in she
                           asked her how
                           long she had been with her. Mrs. Grey told her about two months. She said she was
                           not aware she had
                           been there so long a time, and she was thinking of going away on the morrow.

                        <p id="d196929e1754">She said, 
                           <said id="d196929e1756" who="#abclifford">"Mrs. Grey, I have no money to pay you for your <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="23"> </a></span> kindness, but I have a valuable watch and chain; if you will accept
                              that I will gladly give it to you; you can convert it into money."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e1761">Mrs. Grey would not listen to such a thing. She said, 
                           <said id="d196929e1763" who="#mgrey">"Dear lady, I am poor and
                              not accustomed to the manner of living you have been, and I can easily support myself
                              and Ethel
                              by my work. You are still weak from your recent illness, and you must keep your watch
                              until you
                              need it."

                        <p id="d196929e1766">Austria was touched by so much kindness, and said, 
                           <said id="d196929e1768" who="#abclifford">"Oh! Mrs. Grey, if I had
                              some humble home to call my own, I would be thankful, but I have not a shelter for
                              myself and
                              babe."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1772">Mrs. Grey kindly offered her a home beneath her humble roof as long as she chose to
                           use it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1775">Mrs. Clifford told her of her life, and together, as sister women, they talked over
                           their trials.
                           Mrs. Grey helped her to care for the new born babe. Next day, Mrs. Clifford sought
                           employment in the
                           city. The cottage was two miles distant from the city; it was a long distance to walk
                           for a woman in
                           feeble health, but Austria Clifford was not the woman to idle her time away. She realized
                           that she
                           must toil to support herself and child, and with noble purpose and high resolve, she
                           sought honest
                           employment. She knew how to do plain sewing; she went to the shops in the city and
                           obtained sewing,
                           and would carry enough home with her to keep her busy several days. She lived on,
                           day after day,
                           working and thinking of her desolate life. She seemed to hate the memory of Horace
                           Clifford, to
                           think he had deceived and betrayed her, when she trusted him so implicitly. There
                           is something so
                           pure and high in some women's love, they think their loved ones incapable of a wrong
                           act, and when
                           they see their idol crushed and broken, the fragments strewn upon the earth, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span> they lose confidence in humanity and trust in God. So it was with Austria
                           Cliflord. The man she loved had wantonly and basely betrayed her—so she thought, and
                           her pure, proud
                           nature shrank from the memory of her false love, as the patient shrinks from the surgeon's
                           glittering knife, when it probes the wound for the sufferer's good.

                        <p id="d196929e1780">Mrs. Grey's tender heart ached for the proud and suffering Austria. Her gentle heart
                           had been wrung
                           by a sad, sad parting years ago with one she loved, but she trusted and loved him
                           still; hers was a
                           nature to forgive a wrong done to herself, when the act was committed through affection
                           for her.

                           kept him quiet
                           while the two young mothers sewed patiently on the coarse shop work that was to bring
                           them food.

                           woman was
                           but a shadow of her former self; her thin fingers worked steadily, and her eyes were
                           sunken with
                           care and sleepless nights.

                        <p id="d196929e1851">Once upon a time there dwelt a youthful widow with her one little daughter, in her
                           humble cottage
                           upon her farm. Scarce eighteen years had told their lengths for her when she was left
                           alone,
                           orphaned and widowed; her parents were dead; her young husband was brought home from
                           a falling
                           building, crushed to death. He was a carpenter, and in tearing down an old brick wall
                           the props gave
                           way and he was crushed to death beneath the ruins. Life seemed reft of every joy earth
                           could give to
                           her; she clasped her fatherless babe in her arms and wept bitter, scalding tears above
                           her husband's
                           grave. Not long did she dare to weep in useless grief; her child's existence and her
                           own depended
                           upon her own exertions; nobly she discharged her duty; she rented the few poor acres
                           of land around
                           her cottage and sought employment of her neighbors; she quilted quilts, wove rag carpets,
                           did plain
                           sewing, raised a few chickens, and from her cow made a few pounds of butter to sell.
                           She lived a
                           short distance from the city and walked to market once a week, carrying <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span> her butter and eggs in a basket for sale. One evening it was growing
                           late, a terrible storm was brewing, and she hurried rapidly forward on her way home,
                           and slipping
                           fell and sprained her ankle. She sat by the wayside moaning with pain, grieving for
                           little Ethel.
                           She had left her with a neighbor woman across the road, who kindly offered to care
                           for her. Mrs.
                           Gray moaned out, 
                           <said id="d196929e1855" who="#mgrey">"Oh! how can I ever get home with this fearful sprain."</said>
                           Suddenly she heard the ring of horses feet and the roll of carriage wheels. Soon a
                           magnificent
                           carriage appeared in view, drawn by a splendid pair of jet black horses.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1860">A stately, fine looking man, with deep blue eyes and black hair, silvered at the temples,
                           checked his
                           horses and politely asked if she was hurt. She told him she feared her ankle was broken.
                           He kindly
                           offered to assist her home, which she thankfully accepted. He supported her gently
                           to the carriage
                           and drove to her home as directed. The neat little cottage, with its dainty white
                           curtained windows,
                           showed an air of gentility and refinement in its possessor. Mrs. Black, seeing her
                           neighbor arrive
                           in a carriage with a distinguished looking man, immediately conjectured something
                           was wrong and
                           hastily went to her assistance. When she had been helped to her little cane-seated
                           rocking chair,
                           the gentleman remarked that medical aid would be required and he would return to the
                           city and send
                           it. In order to do this it was necessary he should know the name. Mrs. Grey told him
                           her name. He
                           then introduced himself as Mr. Parke, late of Montreal, Canada, but now of New York
                           city. Mrs. Grey
                           thanked him kindly for his assistance and directed him to send Dr. Moore to her. He
                           bowed, gazed
                           with lingering admiration in his eyes upon Mrs. Grey, and departed. Soon the doctor
                           arrived and Mrs.
                           Grey's ankle was found to be <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="28"> </a></span> badly dislocated. When it had been
                           attended to and the doctor had taken leave of her, enjoining perfect quiet upon her
                           for a few days,
                           she took her little year-old babe in her arms and wept, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e1864" who="#mgrey">"Dear little
                              Ethel, mamma is hurt now; she can not work for you, sweet pet."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1867">The babe looked up with patient, wondering blue eyes, as if to say, 
                           <said id="d196929e1869" who="#egrey">"Never mind,
                              mamma; I'11 be good."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1872">Mrs. Black waited upon Mrs. Grey with true womanly kindness, cooking her food and
                           tending her babe.
                           They were poor people—the Blacks, but they had kind, human hearts in their bosoms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1875">Next day, the carriage, with the high stepping black horses, was drawn up at the cottage
                           door, and
                           the stately blue eyed man called and made inquiries of how Mrs. Grey was getting on.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1878">She was neatly dressed, sitting in her rocking chair, with her babe on her lap; she
                           blushed as he
                           entered, and bade him be seated, her fine eyes sank beneath the steady admiring gaze
                           of his deep
                           blue eyes, as she told him she was doing quite well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1881">This was but the beginning of many pleasant visits from him. She could not well be
                           rude to him, he
                           had been so kind to her when she needed help, still she shrank from the attention
                           he bestowed upon
                           her. She felt the difference in the positions they occupied in the world. He was a
                           man of wealth and
                           high station, while she was but an humble country woman, earning her daily bread by
                           honest toil. She
                           was pure and noble hearted, and her innocent life left the stamp of her sweet patient
                           disposition on
                           her fair brow.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1885">He was a man of the world, buffeted with its cares and disappointments. He was tired
                           of the giddy
                           thoughtless throng which principally compose fashionable life. Wealth poured <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="29"> </a></span> her countless stores at his feet; he had traveled far and wide; he had
                           sat beneath the leafy palm tree on the Nile, and had stood wrapt in awe and admiration
                           gazing upon
                           the frozen icebergs of the Arctic zone. Everything that money could procure or taste
                           invent, had
                           been his. He had married in his youth, and the woman to whom his life had been joined,
                           was a
                           shallow, frivolous, weak-minded and fashionable woman. Ah! that tells the tale. How
                           many men are
                           wrecks to-day—stranded along the shore of time—that might have been grand and full
                           of life and hope,
                           but for the weak and shallow women that have made their lives a hopeless existence,
                           their actions a
                           gilded chlcat. Such a man was Mr. Parke. Their marriage had been childless; his home
                           lacked the
                           attraction that makes man's home a paradise. He envied the humblest man in the city
                           of New York tlat
                           could take his own born child in his arms and love it with a father's love. He treated
                           his wife with
                           all the kindness and respect of a high nature, but it was a bitter disappointment
                           to him to know his
                           broad acres, vast estates and rich mining stocks must go without an heir. He contributed
                           largely to
                           all benevolent societies. There was not a charitable institution in the State of New
                           York but bore
                           the magnificent contributions of Mr. Parke. His wife did not care for wealth. She
                           had such a large
                           income, she was daily engrossed with the thought of how she might spend a portion
                           of it for her own
                           selfish indulgence. She considered poor people a nusiance, that ought not be allowed
                           to exist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1890">All unexpectedly Mr. Parke had come upon humble Mary Grey, as she lay moaning with
                           pain by the
                           roadside. There was something in the suffering, patient face that touched his heart.
                           He was
                           attracted by the loneliness of her life; he thought of her as he drove home, and thought
                           how a
                           portion <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span> of his almost boundless wealth might benefit her. Day
                           after day found him a visitor at the humble cottage. Little Ethel loved him with childish
                           fondness.
                           He brought costly toys for her, and crowded bon-bon boxes into her little hands until
                           they could
                           hold no more, and she would look up with patient sweetness in her eyes, as if asking
                           him to desist.
                           Mary was recovering rapidly. Mrs. Black was very kind. She remarked to Mary one day,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e1894">"I expect
                              you will be leaving us soon; Mr. Parke seems so ardent in his admiration."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e1897">Mary's delicate face crimsoned over with hot blood as she replied,

                           drifting into

                              attention, if he is not in earnest. Men high up in the world do not seek women in
                              the humble
                              walks of life for any good, if they do not offer them marriage. Being your friend,
                              I make bold
                              to tell you, Mary, unless he offers to marry you, it is better you see him no more.
                              Remember,
                              you are a widow; you have no one to befriend you, and if once your reputation suffers,
                              you can
                              not obtain honest employment."

                           possessed a feeling of sympathy for all humanity, and she had a dread of inflicting
                           pain on any
                           one.

                                    have caught the last faint breath as it fluttered off, from lips that were growing

                                    give me the love my poor desolate heart has craved. Write me one line and say you

                                    for
                                    us to be happy in the life you propose. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="34"> </a></span> You would soon
                                    tire of a woman that would throw aside honor and truth and trample on virtue for the
                                    sake of a few blissful hours of passionate love. My life is lonely and hard with toil,
                                    but it is preferable to a life of shameful ease. The passion you have nourished for
                                    me
                                    will soon wear away. If your life is void of happiness, go to work; aim at some high
                                    place in your country's needed work; go into the highways and by-ways of life, relieve
                                    the destitute, comfort the heart-broken and distressed; do the work appointed for
                                    man to
                                    do, and you will find that peace that cometh to the weary ones of earth. You asked
                                    my
                                    forgiveness. I grant it freely. Our Savior on his dying cross forgave his persecutors.
                                    You were only a good friend, and meant kindness. I can hardly understand how a man
                                    of
                                    your mind and social standing could fancy a woman so humble as myself. Wishing you

                           her feet and looked
                           up with loving blue eyes into her face, she took him up in her arms and cuddled him
                           up in a little
                           warm heap, close to her aching heart. Ethel sat at her mamma's feet, and leaning her
                           little golden
                           head against her knee, fell asleep. And thus they sat as the hours went by, Mary talking,

                              have both been through the furnace of affliction. You have suffered, but there was
                              no dishonor
                              in your suffering, there was no trust betrayed by the man you worshipped. Oh, Mary,
                              Mary! it is
                              the knowledge of an unworthy love that brings sorrow to my heart. Mr. Park was honorable
                              with
                              you, he did not seek to deceive you, he told you he was a married man, but unhappy

                              state. He then bade you a sad farewell—going out to forget you amid the cares of

                              on earth-there is so much soul and heartfelt goodness in your face. Your mind is pure,
                              and amid
                              the hollow glare of fashionable life woman loses that nobility of mind, that purity
                              of heart
                              that makes her lovely in the eyes of God and man. Women are trained to make a display

                              fashionable life as circus riders are trained to make a display in the ring. They
                              dress, attend
                              balls and theaters, paint their faces, friz their hair, pinch their feet with tight
                              shoes and
                              their waists with corsets until they are deformed. They scorn the idea of being useful,
                              and
                              consider a knowledge of housework disgraceful. They drag through life, made miserable
                              by their
                              pining and regrets, and soon come to an early grave because they lack the will and
                              common sense
                              to take hold of life in a plain, practical way and make the right use of their hands
                              and brains.
                              We have a nation growing weak to-day, and becoming demoralized through the weakness
                              of its wives
                              and mothers. Men lose heart when they see naught but insipid idleness in women."

                           for future
                           wealth and fame. Mary would take baby Joe in her arms, and sit hour after hour with

                           their expenses had to be paid; the few acres and the home had to sold. They then removed

                           Austria continued
                           to write, and sometimes a sweet little poem was published; but she received no compensation
                           for it,
                           and her existence depended on her daily work with her needle.

                           He had been a boot-black in New York. He said his parents were dead, and he wanted

                           could find a home. His line dark eyes and close-cut and black curls, gave him an air

                           refinement superior to that of the other boys. The small firm mouth, and low broad

                           piercing black eyes, that the children sometimes pointed out and said,

                           liberal with him,
                           giving him a crust, a cold potato or something to sustain life.

                           very lonely. He had not a friend in all the wide world, and he felt his lonely condition

                           as he was going to a strange country, with only strangers for company.

                           eyes of the city
                           boys. Life seemed opening up higher and grander to their crowded vision; they looked
                           eagerly forward
                           to the home in the west, wondering if they would meet with kindness or rebuff. As

                           hard-working, honest boys, looking for a place in life wherein they could improve

                           to lower
                           them in physical strength, and unfit them for steady, honest work. If the employers

                           to degrade and
                           corrupt the human race. What boy or girl in life, when they are hungry and cold, will

                           principle to reason it is not right to take food when they are starving for it; even
                           if that food
                           has to be stolen.

                           uphold them. They indulge in wicked and criminal courses; turn aside from the path

                           shrank from association with the other boys, and looked to Joe for protection. Joe

                           a rich man; he
                           had gained property rapidly, he owned a farm of several hundred acres, had a variety
                           store of all
                           the goods necessary for a country place, and was making money fast; but he had an
                           ambition to be
                           wealthy. He meant to start to Leadville, Colorado, in a few days to try his hand at
                           mining. He felt
                           like Joe would be a steady, honest boy, in whom he could trust. Next morning he took
                           Joe into his
                           confidence and told him what he required of him.

                           going. The name of Leadville possessed a charm for him; he felt it was in some way
                           to be the goal of
                           his wishes.

                        <p id="d196929e2421">Mr. Bland sent him to the fields with his hands in the forenoon, where he could take
                           a lesson in
                           plowing. It was only fun for Joe. He guided the sleek and shining horses along the
                           straight rows of
                           corn as easily and sat as stately and erect on the riding plow as if he had been driving
                           Bonner's
                           finest horses along Broadway in New York. He felt proud and happy. Far away, as far
                           as human eye
                           could reach, the beautiful undulating plains of Kansas farms spread out to view, dotted
                           with farm
                           houses and occasional clumps of trees, herds of stock were guarded by the cow boys
                           and kept from the
                           fields of growing grain. Far away to the east a black column of smoke came drifting
                           along from the
                           locomotive as it came driving over the prairies. He paused for a moment, rapt in pleasure,
                           gazing
                           upon the huge engine, emblems of man's power and ingenuity.

                        <p id="d196929e2424">He worked steadily until noon. He thought of the other boys, and wondered if they
                           had a pleasant home
                           like his, and some way his heart smote him when he thought of George Kent. The boys
                           had to be
                           separated and taken to different homes. There was a sad and wistful look in George's
                           eyes that went
                           straight to Joe's tender heart, and he wished that George might share his home. But
                           it was like
                           chance work; each boy had to risk getting a good home. The finest looking boys were
                           chosen first—I
                           mean the strongest, most able-bodied ones. There were few in Kansas that could take
                           boys just for
                           ornaments; they wanted boys that were able to work, and oftimes the fare of the western
                           farmer was
                           rough and the work hard. A boy had to possess strength as well as will. They must
                           work early and
                           late and be content to make the best of hard times.

                           Poor George's lot had fallen amid the rough and heartless ones, and he suffered many
                           misfortunes,
                           while Joe's lot seemed to have fallen in pleasant places.

                           George a very promising subject for a farm hand. They looked at his delicate little

                           at the small, well-formed mouth; the low, broad forehead, with the dark curls clustering
                           round the
                           temple; at the large, mournful eyes, with their pathetic expression, and remarked

                        <p id="d196929e2438">Poor George was well nigh heart-broken; he was fearful he would not be able to procure

                           not strong enough to keep it, once he had obtained it. The second day the boys had
                           all found homes
                           but George Kent; he was almost out of heart. His friend and protector, Joe Clifford,
                           had gone among
                           the first boys. At length a rough, heavy set man, with coarse features and ill-looking
                           eyes,
                           consented to take George on trial, remarking as he did so that

                           consisted of fried potatoes, fat bacon, meat, cornbread, and buttermilk, old and stale.
                           George
                           swallowed some of the fried potatoes, and took one sup of the buttermilk, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span> which was so sour he could not drink it. The younger son, Dave Breeze,
                           urged him kindly to take something more, but George did not feel as if he could eat
                           another
                           mouthful. When supper had been eaten, and the dishes cleared away, Jerushy ordered
                           them off to bed,
                           saying,

                           as he listened to
                           her words and thought he must sleep with those two great dirty-looking boys. He never
                           raised a word
                           of objection, however, until they had gone into the room, which was scantily furnished.
                           It had one
                           cheap bedstead, with straw-bed and one of Jerushy's patch-work quilts for cover; a
                           few wooden chairs
                           and a box or two. Dave, who was kindly inclined toward the new boy, asked him which
                           side he would
                           take, or would he prefer the middle of the bed.

                           The bare floor looked hard and uninviting to George; but much more restful than the
                           bed, with its
                           occupants; he did not undress, but lay down on the bare floor.

                        <p id="d196929e2515">Farmer Breeze put the new boy to hoeing corn with Dave. Poor little George; he worked
                           with all his
                           might, but could not keep up with Dave. Dave kindly hoed a few hills for him every
                           little while, and
                           the long and vigorous stroke of the hoe showed him a competent hand to hoe corn; while
                           George,
                           laboring with all his might, made slow progress. At night his little hands were blistered
                           and his
                           head and shoulders ached so badly he could scarcely move. To add to his discomfort,
                           Jerushy had
                           discovered that he had slept on the floor; and at supper she said,

                        <p id="d196929e2521">Poor George! Here was his terrible trouble again. He could hoe corn all day and blister
                           his hands; he
                           could eat the fat pork and potatoes, and drink the stale buttermilk, but to sleep
                           with Jim and Dave
                           was too much. He made no reply, but mentally resolved he never would sleep with them.

                        <p id="d196929e2524">When supper was over he repaired to the room with them, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="56" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span> and
                           determined to make his escape and run away. He did not know where he should go, or
                           what he should
                           do; but worn, tired and stiff in body as he was, he was still resolute to leave. He
                           pulled off his
                           shoes; he had fifty cents in money, he had brought from New York with him; his clothes
                           were coarse,
                           but new and strong. He thought it would be best to lie down and deceive Dave and Jim
                           by making them
                           believe he was asleep until they were asleep. Dave gave him choice of sides, and George
                           took the
                           front side near the window; he laid aside his coat, and got in bed with his pantaloons
                           on. Dave
                           would shield him, he knew that. Pretty soon Dave and Jim were snoring away, Jerushy
                           was sleeping the
                           sleep of the just, and George knew the time had come when he could make his escape
                           without
                           detection. He slipped quietly from the bed, put on his coat, and taking his hat and
                           shoes, crept out
                           of the window. He made his escape without detection. After he had got clear of the
                           house he was
                           undecided what course to pursue. He stood silent for a few minutes, looking up at
                           the beautiful
                           western sky, studded over with stars; at length he concluded to follow the railroad
                           track and
                           continue his journey further west. His feet were blistered and sore with steady walking
                           the day
                           before; his head ached, and his eyes filled with blinding tears, as he took his lonely
                           way out over
                           the western plains, homeless and friendless. He wondered if in all the wide earth
                           there was a
                           creature more miserable than himself. He brushed the tears from his eyes, and prayed
                           a little,
                           choked, sobbing prayer, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e2528" who="#gkent">"Lord, pity and care for me."</said> He then
                           walked on as fast as his feet would carry him until daylight, when he came in sight
                           of a farm house,
                           and decided to ask for something to eat, and then continue his journey until noon,—when
                           he <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="52"> </a></span> would rest and get some sleep in a secluded spot by the
                           wayside.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2534">Far as eye could reach across the western plains, there were fertile fields and cosy
                           looking farm
                           houses; but George had an unaccountable dread of farmers' wives, fearing they, like
                           Jerushy, would
                           require him to room with their boys. He almost feared to stop at the house he was
                           nearing and ask
                           for a bite to eat, for fear he would be detected as a runaway and returned to Jerushv's
                           care. But
                           hunger makes us reckless, and he was quite hungry. The lady of the house was just
                           the reverse from
                           Jerushy; she was pleasant, amiable and evidently a woman of culture and education;
                           her two
                           daughters. fresh, rosy-faced girls of twelve and fourteen years of age. assisted their
                           mother in
                           doing the housework.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2537">The farmer and his hands had breakfasted and gone to the fields to work; the girls
                           were busied in
                           clearing away the breakfast dishes. George approached the lady and politely asked
                           her for a piece of
                           bread; she told him to come in and eat his breakfast. He washed his face and hands
                           and sat down to
                           the neat, well arranged breakfast table. There were slices of good, home-cured ham,
                           sweet, golden
                           butter, fresh, home-made light bread and good coffee, with a dessert of peaches, cream
                           and sugar.
                           What a different breakfast table from Jerushy's, with her fried potatoes and stale
                           buttermilk!
                           George looked longingly at the kind, motherly woman, and listened to the gentle tone
                           in which she
                           spoke to her girls, and a wish came over him that he might live in a home like that
                           and have such a
                           mother. Once he was on the point of making a confession to the kind lady, and ask
                           her to let him
                           live with and help her daughters work. He glanced down at his male attire and felt
                           the lady would
                           not like to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="58" data-tei-n="53"> </a></span> trust her daughters with a girl that had come from New

                        <p id="d196929e2542">My readers have doubtless surmised that George Kent was none other than Georgia Kentrall's
                           child,
                           which was indeed the case. The nurse had robbed her of her money, her home and her
                           sex, making her
                           believe, in her earliest childhood's years, she must wear boy's apparel in order to
                           procure a living
                           more readily, and her male attire was in a great measure a protection to her, as boys
                           are often safe
                           in rough crowds where girls are in great danger.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2546">George Kent had roughed it in the streets of New York city; listened to the talk of
                           the low and the
                           vile, but beyond that there was no impurity in her life. She had lived on, friendless
                           for years,
                           making a penny here and there, saving a little money, and longing with the unutterable
                           longing of a
                           girl's heart for a home, for kindness and protection. When Mr. Reid made the proposition
                           to take the
                           boys west, who desired to go, she had, in a moment of enthusiasm, determined to go,
                           hoping to be
                           able to better her fortunes, and in time to assume her own attire. She had become
                           accustomed to the
                           boy's apparel from her infancy, but the native modesty of her maiden's heart began
                           to assert itself,
                           and at fifteen Georgie longed to be with her own sex, and not be exposed to the hardships
                           of a boy's
                           life. The exposure she had been compelled to endure for the past few days had been
                           so severe that
                           she felt like she must give up in despair. She ate her breakfast in silence—a girl
                           alone in a
                           strange land; she felt so hopeless and helpless; she felt a delicacy about disclosing
                           her sex to the
                           lady, fearful she might not believe her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2549">When she had finished her breakfast she offered the kind woman her fifty cents to
                           pay for it. This
                           was kindly refused <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="59" data-tei-n="54"> </a></span> by the lady saying,

                           </said> She gave him a a paper with biscuit and ham and doughnuts wrapped up in it, as she
                           said, for his dinner.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2557">George once more resumed his journey westward, moving toward the setting sun. At noon
                           he stopped by
                           the wayside to eat his dinner and rest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2560">The landscape lay like a picture, wrapped in silent beauty. Far to the northwest the
                           purple forest
                           showed in the disance; to the south stretched a beautiful plain of rich farming land;
                           herds of
                           cattle were grazing here and the drowsy tinkling of the bells was a lullaby to his
                           tired nerves. He
                           ate his dinner and still had enough left for supper. Sitting here. 'neath a small
                           tree, he soon sank
                           into a refreshing sleep: when he awoke it was dark and the stars were shining; he
                           felt greatly
                           refreshed, but decided to remain until morning. Early next morning he ate his breakfast
                           and pursued
                           his way out west.

                        <p id="d196929e2616">About nine o'clock the air began to feel heavy and close; dense clouds rolled up from
                           the northwest,
                           and went hurrying across the sky, obscuring the sun and turning noonday brightness
                           into midnight's
                           darkest gloom. Soon terrific peals of thunder rent the air, and vivid gleams of lightning
                           blazed
                           from cloud to cloud, until the whole earth seemed charged with electricity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2619">George still kept on; he was far distant from any place of refuge. He had read of
                           thunder storms on
                           the plains, and heard they were not of long duration. Suddenly the roar of a mightly
                           tornado filled
                           the air, and the long to be remembered storm, on the 31st of May, 1879, burst in all
                           its terrible
                           fury. Wind, hail and rain bore down in blinding sheets; <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="61" data-tei-n="56"> </a></span> houses,
                           barns, stock, chickens, furniture, beds, household goods of very variety came flying
                           through the
                           air, borne on by the fierce winds of the tornado. Cars were blown from the track,
                           and human beings
                           were scattered in atoms-stunned, bleeding, dying. The storm extended through nearly
                           the whole
                           northern tier of counties, scattering death-dealing destruction in its course; but
                           it was most
                           violent between the Blue Rapids and Centralia stations, on the Central Branch railroad,
                           about thirty
                           miles distant from each other.

                        <p id="d196929e2625">My readers will not fail to remember the terrible cyclone in Kansas, Missouri and
                           Nebraska on the
                           31st of May, 1879. Hundreds of lives were lost, and many thousands dollars worth of
                           property was
                           destroyed.

                        <p id="d196929e2628">When George heard the roar of the tempest, and saw the rapidly approaching clouds,
                           he looked around
                           for a place of safety along the railroad track. He spied a clump of small trees that
                           had taken root
                           and were growing; he soon found a place where the bushes were strongly rooted in the
                           earth; he lay
                           down close to the earth, and grasping a stout oak shrub, he prepared to care for himself.
                           There,
                           alone amid the roar of the elements and the crash of falling timber, he listened to
                           the mad
                           bellowing of the thunder and thought of the desolation that must follow such a tremendous
                           storm.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2631">The train had gone by but a few moments when the wind struck it with violent fury,
                           lifting it from
                           the track and strewing the earth with its fragments for miles around.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2634">George shuddered as he saw the people being blown in every direction. He held on to
                           the small bushes,
                           and the wind tossed him up and down, threshing the earth with his body; the rain drenching
                           him in
                           torrents, and deadly missiles flying all around. He had little time to be afraid or
                           to pray. He held
                           on with all his might to the bush, and thought if <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="62" data-tei-n="57"> </a></span> God sent death
                           to him, he would be done suffering. He did not crave to live, but he felt, lonely
                           as he was on
                           earth, it would be pleasanter to die in some calm spot; bid farewell to life on some
                           fair day, than
                           to die out here all alone, and leave his body to be destroyed by wild beasts, or to
                           rot away on the
                           plains. He thought of New York, of his friend Joe Clifford, and wished he might see
                           Joe once
                           more.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2639">Suddenly a heavy form was dashed along side of him, and as well as George could see,
                           the man appeared
                           to be dead; his face was smeared with blood from a fearful gash cut in his forehead
                           by some of the
                           flying debris. The man lay prone upon the earth, and the muddy water was pouring over
                           his face.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2642">George let loose of the bush, and raising himself to his feet, bent over and lifted
                           up the head of
                           the man, supporting his head in his arms to prevent his drowning. He still breathed
                           but seemed to be
                           stunned by the fall. George supported his head until the fury of the storm had somewhat
                           abated. He
                           took his handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the blood from the pale and beautiful
                           forehead, with
                           its bright brown curls clustering around the broad temples. He saw the wound was not
                           dangerous—only
                           a scalp wound. The eyes were closed, but the face was matchless in its grand beauty;
                           there were
                           lines of care on his face that spoke of sorrow rather than age. He was apparently
                           about thirty years
                           of age—tall, heavy, broad-shouldered and finely formed. He was too heavy for George
                           to lift. It took
                           all his frail strength to support the head and shoulders sufficiently to keep him
                           from drowning,
                           until the water had in a measure subsided. George chafed the lifeless hands and tried
                           to bring life
                           into the apparently dead body; all of no avail, the eyes remained shut and the beautiful
                           lips were
                           closed. The rain ceased falling; <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span> almost as suddenly as the tempest
                           had come it passed away, and the sun shone out bright and clear on that awful scene
                           of ruin and
                           devastation.

                        <p id="d196929e2648">George gazed for a moment on the water-flooded earth; on the trees and ruins of buildings,
                           and
                           thanked God for his kindness in protecting him from harm. He thought the grand looking
                           man that lay
                           with closed eyes and upturned face was dead; he bent his head to the cold, dead face,
                           kissed the
                           polished brow and rained hot, burning tears upon the cold, white cheeks, sobbing,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e2650" who="#gkent">"Oh, why must death come to such as he; he looked so good, so noble."</said> He clasped the
                           stately head close in his arms and wept as he would have wept over a father or brother.
                           Suddenly a
                           shiver went over the strong frame; he opened wide his matchless blue eyes and looked
                           with a strange,
                           frightened look into the mournful tear-stained black eyes of George Kent.

                           broken, straightened out his arms, and said,

                              yes, George, I see; you have been well raised and you are rather aristocratic in your

                           felt the heart of Clement Howe was pure and noble as that of some pure, high-minded
                           woman. He felt a
                           security and peace come over him he had never felt before as he sat there, clasped
                           close to that
                           throbbing heart. He felt sleep unconsciously stealing over him; the last few days
                           of exposure and
                           excitement had been too much for him, and the thorough wetting <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="67" data-tei-n="62"> </a></span> he
                           had undergone was rapidly chilling his blood and putting him in a fair way to have
                           a bad spell of
                           fever. Clement pressed the little brown head to his bosom and said, kindly, 
                           <said id="d196929e2760" who="#chowe">"George, I fear to let you sleep in your present condition; we had better try to move
                              on until
                              we get the chill from the wetting worn off. You are not used to life on the plains,
                              and this
                              keen air is penetrating to the marrow of my bones, and I think it is the same with
                              you."
                           </said>
                           George readily acquiesced in what Clement said, and springing to his feet, drove away
                           the chill that
                           was creeping over him. They proceeded along the railroad as well as they could. The
                           track was torn
                           up and obstructed with fallen timbers and debris from the buildings which had been
                           destroyed by the
                           storm. They walked about three miles, when they heard some one moaning by the roadside.
                           As they
                           approached the place from which the sound came, they heard a voice in kindly, assuring

                           leaves and sticks
                           from his wool. He told Clement that he and Marinda had started north with the negro
                           emigrants from
                           Mississippi; that he wanted to enter land and have a home in Kansas. Kansas was to
                           the negro
                           emigrants what Canaan was to the Israelites. He had no settled destination. He told
                           Clement he would
                           like to work for some man until he could get a start to go to farming with.

                        <p id="d196929e2830">Clement told him he had a home in the Rocky mountains; that he was on his way to his
                           home, and he
                           would give him and his wife employment until he could get a start. This suited Silas
                           and Marinda;
                           they felt a security in Mr. Howe's presence they had not known before. It was now
                           quite late at
                           night, and they decided to remain in that place until morning.

                        <p id="d196929e2833">Clement knew he was quite a distance from the next railroad station, and as the road
                           had been
                           destroyed by the storm <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="69" data-tei-n="64"> </a></span> they could not hope to be overtaken by a
                           western bound train, but must walk to the next station. Clement told Silas to help
                           him gather some
                           loose planks and limbs that were strewn around, so they could erect a kind of shelter
                           from the sharp
                           wind. They soon had a kind of wall built so they could sit on the south side and be
                           protected from
                           the wind. They sat here until morning. After midnight George fell asleep, and Clement
                           tenderly drew
                           the dusky little head to his side and sheltered the wet and chilled form with his
                           arm. George slept
                           a sleep of exhaustion, and dreamed of beautiful rooms with costly furniture and elegant
                           surroundings. He awoke to find himself stiff and chilled with the exposure he had
                           undergone. He felt
                           the warmth and protection of Clement's sheltering arm, and knew he had a friend on
                           whom he could
                           rely.

                        <p id="d196929e2838">They had not tasted food for one day and night, and they stirred themselves at the
                           earliest dawn and
                           took up their line of march westward, hoping to obtain food and rest soon.

                        <p id="d196929e2842">Far away in the east the sun rose in majestic splendor and smiled down upon that scene
                           of desolation
                           on the plains, as they toiled on, Clement in the lead, striding rapidly on, not knowing
                           how it
                           strained every nerve in George's body to keep 'up. George trotted along at his heels,
                           almost out of
                           breath. Silas and Marinda brought up the rear.

                        <p id="d196929e2845">Suddenly Clement paused, and an exclamation of pity burst from his lips. There, directly
                           in front of
                           him on the railroad track, lay a child of apparently two years old. The little dimpled
                           form had been
                           thrown with terrible violence on the earth, and her little life had gone out there
                           alone in the
                           storm and darkness. One little hand was thrown above her golden head; the other clasped
                           her little
                           dress that was drenched by the rain; her beautiful blue eyes were open in the morning
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="70" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span> sunshine, but the awful seal of death was set upon her brow. Somebody's
                           petted darling was lying here dead and alone. Reverently they gathered around the
                           little body, and
                           George knelt and lifted the shining head in his arms, crying out, 
                           <said id="d196929e2849" who="#chowe">"Oh! you poor,
                              sweet baby; what a lonely death for you."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2852">Clement said, 
                           <said id="d196929e2854" who="#chowe">"Here, George, let me see if there is any hope of life."</said> But
                           no life could be discovered; the little form was rigid and cold in death; the spirit
                           had winged its
                           way to a home of peace and rest beyond this vale of sorrow.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2858">Clement lifted the little form in his arms and decided to carry it further on until
                           he found a
                           suitable place for burial. The weight of the child somewhat slackened his speed, and
                           George was
                           enabled to keep up with him. They walked on until noon, when they met a train eastward
                           bound. He
                           flagged and got them to stop. He told Silas and Marinda if they wished to return on

                        <p id="d196929e2861">They decided to remain with him. He put the beautiful, dead baby in the care of the
                           conductor and
                           told him of the terrible destruction they must encounter, and they continued their
                           journey.

                        <p id="d196929e2864">Clement saw the crimson cheeks and scarlet lips of George were flushed with fever,
                           and his heart
                           ached for the noble little fellow who trudged on so manfully, while Silas and Marinda
                           were
                           constantly bewailing their hard lot and wishing for something to eat and somewhere
                           to rest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2868">He took the little brown hand in his; it was burning with fever; he said, 
                           <said id="d196929e2870" who="#chowe">"George,
                              I am afraid this will make you sick."
                           </said> George would not complain, though his bones ached
                           and the fever scorched him; he felt happier than he ever remembered to have felt before
                           in his life.
                           He, too was fearful he <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="71" data-tei-n="66"> </a></span> would fall sick, but he resolved to keep up
                           as long as he could go. He was afraid Mr. Howe would repent of his offer and leave
                           him to the mercy
                           of strangers if he should fall sick; he did not know the generous heart of Clement
                           Howe. He was kind
                           to any creature in misfortune and he felt that he owed his life to George Kent, therefore
                           he would
                           be doubly kind to him. He stopped and looked away over the plains hoping to spy some
                           cabin near
                           which they could stop and get something to eat and rest awhile. About two miles to
                           the north he saw
                           a small house, toward this they now directed their steps. George was well nigh fainting
                           with
                           exhaustion and the heat of the sun 'ere they had traveled half the distance. Clement
                           kindly offered
                           to carry him in his arms the remainder of the way. George blushed painfully and refused
                           to allow him
                           to, saying he could walk. He held up until within a quarter of a mile of the cabin
                           he sank to the
                           ground overcome with fever and exposure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2876">Clement tenderly lifted the little thin form in his arms and carried him to the cabin,
                           where he
                           procured cold water, bathed his head and gave him water to drink, which restored him.
                           The woman at
                           the cabin with true western hospitality told them to

                           </said> and freely offered her bed for the use of the young stranger.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2883">Clement lay George upon the bed, removed his coat and told him to lie still, that
                           he would keep cold
                           water to his head and he would soon be better, as he was overdone for the want of
                           sleep.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2886">George obeyed, and was soon in a deep sleep. Clement asked the woman if she would
                           prepare them some
                           food, as they had been fasting for almost two days. This she did with ready kindness.
                           Her husband
                           had been farming in Kansas for several years; they had become accustomed to the privations
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="67"> </a></span> of frontier life. She made good coffee, fried ham and baked sweet,
                           fresh cream biscuit. Clement ate, and then Silas and Marinda were invited to partake
                           of the food.
                           Clement had plenty of money, and he determined to pay handsomely for the trouble they
                           were giving
                           the good woman. George still slept. Clement had asked permission of the woman to take
                           her husband's
                           gun and shoot some prairie chickens which he saw a short distance from the house.
                           She consented
                           readily and he soon returned with a nice brace of birds which he directed Marinda
                           to dress, and
                           broil a portion of them for George when he awoke. Shortly after sunset he awoke, much
                           refreshed from
                           his sleep and the cold application to his head. The cravings of appetite began to
                           be felt. Clement
                           brought the broiled bird and cup of fragrant coffee, and some of the nice biscuit,
                           and insisted he
                           should eat. George ate and felt almost well, saying, after he had done, 
                           <said id="d196929e2890" who="#gkent">"I am
                              ready to go on the road now, Mr. Howe, if you wish to pursue your journey."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2893">Clement told him to rest and they would resume their journey on the morrow.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2896">He sank to rest like a tired child. After the farmer returned they had supper. Clement
                           told him of
                           the destruction caused by the tornado, and how near he came to losing his life. They
                           retired for the
                           night, feeling thankful to God for his care and protection.

                           It is useless to
                           describe the trip; they passed through a beautiful country, diversified by cities,
                           towns, villages,
                           farm houses and lonely stretches of forest land. Rapidly as the train sped on its
                           western way, it
                           did not fly fast enough for the anxious men who had set out on a wild goose chase
                           with the hope of
                           finding the two they sought; the one, an imaginary son; the other, the little daughter
                           of his
                           beloved sister. Of the two men, Dr. Throop suffered the most acute pain; he imagined
                           everything bad
                           to have happened to Georgia's little girl.

                              friendless, striving to earn the bread she ate! Just think, Horace; her delicate little

                              toiling for support as soon as she could be taught to black boots!"

                              vainly for sixteen long years, and I am well-nigh heart-broken."

                           memory of that curse ringing in his ears forevermore. He did not seek to drown it
                           by dissipation; he
                           was a truly noble man and a deeply repentant one; he knew it was his own passion and
                           self-indulgence
                           that had dashed the cup of happiness from his lips. He longed with all the deep, unutterable
                           longing
                           of a strong man's love to meet once more his darling wife, and sue for forgiveness
                           at her feet. He
                           saw the enormity of his sin; he seemed to realize what that high, proud nature of
                           Austria's suffered
                           when she believed herself to be cast out and betrayed by one she had trusted with
                           all the faith and
                           trust of woman's deathless love.

                        <p id="d196929e2958">He resolved to make atonement for his sin, if a life-time of devotion to her memory
                           could do so. But,
                           alas! how much of suffering must we sometimes endure for an unguarded word that escapes
                           our hasty
                           lips and brings to our lives days and nights of sad regret! So it was with Horace
                           Clifford. He
                           possessed untold wealth; his opinions were sought by the leading business men, both
                           in America and
                           Europe; his ships bore the wealth of many thousand dollars; he owned railroads enough
                           to span the
                           continent, and that man's wife was toiling her life away for her daily bread, and
                           his son had been
                           sent west by a charitable institution to seek a home in the western wilds. It was
                           well for Horace
                           Clifford he did not know what suffering Austria and his son had to endure, or he would,
                           in truth,
                           have been insane—driven wild by his unjust conduct.

                        <p id="d196929e2961">While the train sped on its way bearing him nearer his son, but far away from his
                           beloved wife, he
                           sat with gloomy eyes fixed on the beautiful scenery, with but one thought <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="76" data-tei-n="71"> </a></span> uppermost in his heart and brain; that was, that each moment brought him
                           nearer a great joy or a great disappointnent.

                        <p id="d196929e2967">Dr. Throop's fine blue eyes took in the grand panorama nature spread out before him,
                           and his genial,
                           cheerful nature asserted itself at times and drove away the sad thought of Georgie's
                           misfortune. He
                           pictured her a pure, bright-faced little girl, and would soon again reproach himself,
                           saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e2969" who="#fthroop">"I am foolish to anticipate such things. I will try to be satisfied with

                        <p id="d196929e2972">He was so true hearted and had so high a standard of womanly excellence, that he could
                           hardly
                           imagine, Georgie's child as anything but a noble, high-minded girl, and, in truth,
                           she was. She had
                           the same fine traits of character possessed by her Uncle Frank. And amid the scum
                           and refuse of New
                           York's street arabs, she retained her purity of character untarnished, her nobility
                           of soul
                           unblemished. Her boy's dress was a protection, as boys have a higher regard for a
                           boy that supports
                           himself, than they have for a girl. Little girls are subject to many insults and much
                           rudeness that
                           boys escape. No one suspected her sex, though her delicate features and small hands
                           sometimes called
                           forth exclamations of sympathy from kind-hearted men, while she was engaged in blacking
                           their boots.
                           They generally gave her an extra nickle for her labor, because she was so zealous
                           in her work, and
                           her nimble little fingers flew with a rapidity of motion excelled by few. She carefully
                           hoarded her
                           nickles and ten-cent pieces, and by so doing, was enabled to keep herself in clothing
                           and food. She
                           attended the evening school and soon learned to read and write; she readily acquired
                           a knowledge of
                           mathematics, and at twelve years of age, she was quite a good scholar, besides supporting
                           herself
                           all the time. At that age, she began to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span> realize it was not right
                           for her to pass herself as a boy, and yet there was no one to befriend or protect
                           her in that
                           crowded city. She had longings and aspirations peculiar to a girl of that age; she
                           was quite a
                           womanly girl. She shrank from her association with the street boys, and when her day's
                           work was
                           done, crept away by herself for seclusion and meditation. She had a mind capable of
                           great
                           attainments; she posssessed the high principle of her mother and Uncle Frank, with
                           the fine musical
                           abilities of her father. Her low broad forehead displayed, to a close observer, a
                           head of unusual
                           development for a boy of eleven. With natural refinement and maiden modesty for her
                           safeguard,
                           protected by her male attire, and possessing amiable qualities of mind, she had glided
                           through life
                           with greater ease than one would suppose she could, surrounded by so many low associations.
                           She
                           liked the little street urchins she was thrown with, in a certain way, but many possessed
                           traits of
                           character repulsive to her high sense of honor. She had seen boys put up a poor mouth
                           and tell a
                           pitiful tale of suffering and want to draw money from some passer-by, and then heard
                           them chuckle
                           over their good fortunes in getting money without earning it. Such conduct as this,
                           she always
                           looked upon as contemptible and afterward shunned such associates. For a girl of her
                           age, she
                           possessed much knowledge of the suffering and privation of life; she saw many girls
                           driven by want
                           and hunger to beg. It is a lamentable fact, that boys more readily receive employment
                           than girls.
                           Girls, as a class, are more delicate, and people dislike to have little feeble hands
                           employed, where
                           strong rough hands take hold better.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2977">Georgie felt she had roughed it from infancy in New York city, and now she felt she
                           could rough it
                           out west and grow up with the country; therefore she had cast in her lot with <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="78" data-tei-n="73"> </a></span> the boys going west. Her uncle did not know what a sensible, whole-souled
                           little girl Georgie was; if he had, his trip west would have been a delightful journey—pleasant
                           with
                           bright anticipations of meeting his neice and restoring her to her rightful position
                           in society.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e2982">But all things earthly have an end, so the two friends drew to their journey's end.
                           They went to
                           Parsons, Kansas, where the boys had been sent, and found that they had already procured
                           homes and
                           had been gone several days. They immediately sought out the names of the persons who
                           had taken Joe
                           Clifford and George Kent; they found who had taken them, and procuring guides and
                           a two horse
                           express, they sat out over the plains in search of the boys. They decided to go where
                           Joe had been
                           taken first, as the boys had been taken almost precisely the same route. They drove
                           for two days
                           through the beautiful Kansas lands, enjoying, to a certain extent, the beauty and
                           fertility of the
                           country through which they were traveling. On the third day they arrived at Mr. Brown's
                           farm, only
                           to receive the information that Joe Clifford and his employer had started to Leadville,
                           Colorado.
                           This was a sad disappointment to Horace Clifford. He had looked forward to meeting
                           Joe with great
                           impatience, hoping soon to learn something of Austria. Frank had to use many encouraging
                           words to
                           restore him to anything like his natural self, telling him it would not be hard to
                           find him, as they
                           had the name and address of the man he was with, and people are not spirited away
                           in this nineteenth
                           century. He finally recovered his spirits, and they pursued their way in the direction
                           of Breeze's
                           house, hoping soon to meet with George Kent. Dr. Throop felt considerably disheartened;
                           he thought
                           it quite likely the Leadville contagion had been caught at <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="79" data-tei-n="74"> </a></span> Mr.
                           Breeze's also, and they had hurried George away to the mines to realize a fortune
                           in a few days.

                        <p id="d196929e2987">In due course of time, they arrived at Mr. Breeze's farm, and, upon making inquiries
                           about George
                           Kent, were soon informed by Jerushy that

                           They were to search

                           Kansas, broke over <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="80" data-tei-n="75"> </a></span> them, killing their horses, carrying their
                           express away in the air as if it had been a feather, wounding their driver and leaving
                           them with
                           barely enough life to creep. Horace had an arm broken, which Dr. Throop readily attended
                           to as soon
                           as the storm abated. Horace was white with pain, but he gave no utterance of suffering.
                           They sat
                           down on a small pile of drift-wood and listened to the roar of the receding storm.
                           Away to the
                           southwest it still swept madly on its way, tearing down buildings and crushing out
                           human life with
                           its merciless power. They had remained silent for some time, watching intently the
                           terrible grandeur
                           of the storm, when suddenly a low struggling moan smote upon their ears. It evidently
                           came from some
                           one in distress. They looked in every direction. Soon the quick eye of Dr. Throop
                           caught the glimpse
                           of a woman's torn drapery on a small pile of fallen timbers. He went directly to the
                           spot and found
                           a young girl tightly wedged in between two logs. His heart sank when he saw the painful
                           position of
                           the young lady. The two fallen branches seemed to have fallen together about her waist,
                           and she was
                           apparently crushed by their weight. The beautiful face was white with agony and the
                           delicate hands
                           lifted in pitiful pleading for help. He told her in calm, soothing tones to keep up
                           her courage,
                           that he would soon be able to relieve her. He called the driver to his assistance,
                           and by their
                           united strength they lifted one of the heavy branches of the tree aside so as to release
                           the body of
                           the young lady.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3011">Tenderly he raised the suffering body and bore it to a better place, and used remedies
                           to restore
                           her. He chaffed the white hands and sprinkled the muddy water on the white face and
                           on the beautiful
                           black hair that clustered in curls around her forehead. He soon had the satisfaction
                           of seeing her
                           show signs of recovery. She had fainted from suffering <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="81" data-tei-n="76"> </a></span> and
                           exhaustion. As soon as she was sufficiently restored, Dr. Throop insisted she should
                           stand upon her
                           feet. He was afraid her spine had been injured by the weight of the limbs. On her
                           first effort to
                           stand she sank to the earth with a spasm of pain. The doctor's face grew white with
                           apprehension. He
                           was fearful this beautiful creature, this royal looking woman, was injured for life.
                           His
                           professional skill had taught him if she had sustained injuries, the sooner she received
                           attention
                           the better.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3016">Horace said impatiently, 
                           <said id="d196929e3018" who="#hclifford">"Frank, why do you torture her making her stand; she
                              is evidently too weak to stand on her feet."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3021">Frank replied calmly, 
                           <said id="d196929e3023" who="#fthroop">"I do it for her own good."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3027">He allowed her to rest for a moment and then kindly urged her again to make an effort
                           to stand. He
                           put his hands around her waist to support and brace her; put her hands on his shoulders
                           to support
                           her weight. Kindly and tenderly as a mother would lift a sick child he lifted her
                           to her feet. She
                           stood well on one foot but the other hung limp and useless. A flash of joy crept into
                           the blue eyes
                           of Dr. Throop. He had discovered her spine was not injured; her limbs were sound with
                           the exception
                           of that one ankle. Her injuries were much lighter than he feared. He felt a deep gladness
                           thrilling
                           his heart for her. He knew the ankle could be cured, but he knew if her back had been
                           injured or
                           crushed she could not stand. He took off the large overcoat he had put on at the approach
                           of the
                           storm and wrapping the lovely form in it bade her rest on the ground. He removed his
                           other coat and
                           hastily made bandages to dress the wounded ankle. He found it badly dislocated but
                           not broken. He
                           removed the fine number three, button shoe, and in a short time the beautiful foot
                           and ankle were
                           all <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="82" data-tei-n="77"> </a></span> right, and bandaged with only the necessary application of
                           cold water to heal and restore it to its right use.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3032">After this was done the friends sat down to consider their situation. They were indeed
                           in a dreadful
                           dilemma; alone, far from human habitation, on a desolate, storm-swept plain, without
                           food or fire,
                           and drenched to the skin by the deluge of rain that had fallen. Horace looked gloomy
                           as ever. He had
                           been disappointed; he had not found Joe Clifford as he expected, and now every hope
                           was swept away
                           forever. The driver was a rough but kind-hearted fellow, a sort of roustabout you
                           find in western
                           towns, content to pass his time anywhere, so he had enough to eat. He said it 
                           <said id="d196929e3034" who="#dave">
                              <hi id="d196929e3035" style="; ">"was one of the dad-burndest storms he ever saw, an' he had seed a right
                                 smart in his time."
                              </hi>
                           </said> He was not seriously hurt, but sustained several slight
                           injuries. Dr. Throop was the only sound one in the party. He felt sorry for the lady.
                           He knew she
                           needed attention, kind, womanly nursing and sympathy, and he saw no hope of obtaining
                           it for her. He
                           knew they must remain on the prairie all night, without so much as a bite to eat or
                           a particle of
                           fire to warm their drenched and chilled bodies. He did the best he could under the
                           circumstances. He
                           wrapped his overcoat more closely about the young lady, and bade her be of good cheer;
                           they were
                           doing well to be alive after such a tremendous storm. Horace offered his overcoat
                           as a protection
                           for the lady; this the doctor declined to use, telling him he needed it himself, as
                           there was danger
                           of him taking cold and causing inflammation in his arm. But he remarked, 
                           <said id="d196929e3038" who="#fthrrop">"Horace, you can sit near the young lady, so she will not feel so lonely, while Dick
                              and I try
                              to improvise some kind of conveyance to carry her to a better place than this.
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3041">Horace sat down near the beautiful creature; her white <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="83" data-tei-n="78"> </a></span> face was
                           drawn with suffering, and the black eyes luminous with a steady light that showed
                           she was strong to
                           endure her pain. Horace gazed upon this lovely being without a thrill of admiration.
                           To him there
                           was but 
                           <hi id="d196929e3045" style="font-style: italic;">one</hi> woman beneath the sun, living or dead, and that was his queenly
                           Austria. He sat silent and morose, while Dr. Throop and Dick sought a plank or board
                           on which they
                           could let the lady rest while they carried her to a higher knoll of ground.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3049">Dr. Throop was fired with a deep feeling of affection for this beautiful, helpless
                           girl. He had spent
                           many years of his life in society; he had seen the famed beauties of Europe, had been
                           courted and
                           flattered by the ladies in his native city, but never before had he seen a woman that
                           could thrill
                           every nerve of his being as did this grand young creature, so full of life and beauty.
                           The touch of
                           her delicate hands on his shoulders thrilled him with a feeling akin to adoration.
                           The beautifully
                           molded limbs were fit for a sculptor's model; the delicate foot and arched instep
                           was as dainty as
                           the foot of some princess of royal blood. To him she was grandly beautiful, and he
                           longed to woo and
                           win her for his own.

                           and wide enough
                           to rest the lady upon. The doctor was fearful she would contract a cold from her wetting,
                           and
                           visions of lung fever, pneumonia and other dire diseases flitted through his brain.
                           He knew not what
                           to do. He could not remove her clothing, and he felt to allow her to lie still in
                           them all night
                           would endanger her life.

                        <p id="d196929e3099">As they were returning with the plank, Dick stumbled over a bundle that proved to
                           be a couple of
                           blankets and an oil-cloth they had put in their express when they started on their
                           journey in search
                           of the boys. Here were the very articles needed, but how on earth was he to put them
                           in use?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3102">The young lady was too seriously hurt to unrobe herself <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span> and wrap
                           herself in the blankets, and he felt her delicate maiden modesty would be shocked
                           to allow him to
                           undress her. But there was no other alternative. He must do it. Her health, her life,
                           perhaps,
                           depended on it. When he approached her he saw by the starlight the black eyes were
                           wide open and the
                           face deathly white with pain. Horace sat by her all unconscious of her suffering,
                           and, for aught he
                           said or did, he might as well have been a statue of wood or stone. Dr. Throop knelt
                           beside her in
                           the yielding mud, and, taking her hand in his, felt she was chilled through. He was
                           fearful
                           inflammation would set in in the dislocated ankle. He saw she was conscious, and lifting
                           her head
                           and shoulders in his arms bent his face low to her's and talked kindly and with common
                           sense,
                           telling her he was fearful her wet clothing, chilled by the keen, north wind, would
                           perhaps cause
                           her a violent congestion of the lungs; that he had found two blankets that had been
                           kept dry by the
                           waterproof wrap, and if she would consent he would assist her to unrobe herself of
                           her outer
                           garments and then wrap her in the dry blankets and lay her upon the plank out of the
                           mud until
                           morning, when he hoped to obtain relief from some quarter, as he knew a relief committee
                           would be
                           sent out as soon as the people in the city got the word. The white face grew crimson,
                           and a hot
                           flush mounted the pure white brow. She knew all he said was true, but she almost felt
                           she would
                           rather die with cold than be exposed before this man. Yet there was something so manly
                           and kind in
                           his way that won her confidence, and she felt that of all men on earth she could trust
                           him. She
                           drooped her head in confusion and told him if he thought it was best she would consent
                           to be
                           undressed, saying that she felt able to help herself. He raised her to a sitting position,
                           undid her
                           elaborate traveling suit of fine <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="81"> </a></span> cashmere, and taking it from her
                           body left the elegant underwear and fine underskirt on. He then wrapped her in the
                           blankets, and
                           placing two props underneath the plank, made her a hard bed, but a much more comfortable
                           one than
                           she had occupied but a few moments previous. He laughingly remarked to her that he
                           was not placing
                           her on a cooling board, but on a warming board. He then spread the oilcloth around
                           her, took off his
                           vest, folded it and made her a pillow. saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e3108" who="#fthroop">"now sleep until
                              morning."
                           </said> He felt much better about her. He knew the blankets were warm and the oilcloth
                           would keep out the damp, and he argued to himself, she will be much improved by morning.

                        <p id="d196929e3112">Horace suffered much physically, but his mental anxiety far exceeded his bodily pain.
                           He felt that
                           Austria was suffering and he was helpless to aid her. The hope he had experienced
                           for a few weeks
                           had died away and left him more utterly prostrate than ever before. He saw the noble
                           love of Dr.
                           Throop springing into life for the lovely being he had rescued from death, and he
                           mourned more
                           bitterly for his own lost love.

                        <p id="d196929e3115">Dr. Throop was wide awake the livelong night. To him that night of desolation, with
                           drifting clouds
                           scudding across the sky and the bright light of distant stars gleaming on the water-soaked
                           earth,
                           with the dismal roar of the mighty wind, as it came bleak and shrill from the ice-bound
                           regions, was
                           a night ever to be remembered by him, as the brightest spot in his existence. He had
                           never been in
                           love before. His great heart glowed and throbbed with affection for all humanity,
                           he felt as if he
                           could embrace Dick, and love Horace forever. As for the beautiful unknown being who
                           had thrown him
                           into such a state of perfect happiness, he felt he could not be <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="87" data-tei-n="82"> </a></span>
                           humble enough in his adoration of her. It is the great grand natures that are humble
                           in their loves,
                           vesting the object of their affections with every grand attribute which they desire
                           them to possess;
                           they set them on a pedestal, and as an eastern devotee bows at the shrine of his idolatry,
                           such a
                           nature bows at the feet of its loved one, and fondly imagines the object of its affections
                           to be all
                           its loving fancy paints them. But Dr. Throop's love was indeed worthy of all the love

                           prairie, I will
                           give to the reader a brief history of our lovely heroine. She was the only daughter
                           of wealthy
                           parents, and had been left an orphan in early years. She had a brother several years
                           her senior, who
                           had come into possession of a large sum of money when he was of age. He was a young
                           man of fine
                           mind, but easily led by others. He fell into bad company in the city of Baltimore
                           where he resided.
                           There was a disgraceful gambling scene, a murder that was thrown upon Rufus Stuart,
                           and he barely
                           escaped being hung. He was imprisoned for life, but made his escape by the aid of
                           some friends, and
                           rumor said he had gone west. Adelaide Stuart, his young sister, grew up with this
                           terrible disgrace
                           ever before her. She loved her brother Rufus with all the affection a lonely child
                           could give to an
                           only relative. She believed Rufus was innocent of the crime imputed to him. She knew
                           he was weak,
                           but she could not believe him wholly bad. When she was sixteen years of age she had
                           enlisted friends
                           in his behalf and helped him to escape. He had gone west and joined Custer's s army.
                           She <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="88" data-tei-n="83"> </a></span> received letters from him, from time to time. When she was eighteen she
                           determined to visit him. He had so far escaped detection. Adelaide had always felt
                           the contempt of
                           some of her associates on account of her brother's disgrace, but she was a noble,
                           high-minded girl,
                           and did not allow the scoffs and sneers of the weak-minded few to deter her from her
                           duty and
                           affection to her fallen brother. She argued in this manner, 
                           <said id="d196929e3138" who="#astuart">"if he is disgraced
                              and cast down that is more the reason I should visit him and care for him."
                           </said> During his
                           imprisonment she had visited him every week, carrying with her books, Hlowers and
                           delicate fruits to
                           tempt his appetite, and always cheered him by her pleasant manner and perfect confidence
                           in him.
                           When his escape was accomplished many of his friends were glad he was free, as he
                           had been convicted
                           on purely circumstantial evidence. She had visited him, found him doing well, and
                           well liked and
                           respected. He had entered the army under an assumed name, and was known as Lieutenant
                           John Hobbs. He
                           had been promoted from the ranks for deeds of daring and bravery. He was stationed
                           with a few men to
                           guard a point where he displayed great valor and courage at the time General Custer's
                           army was
                           massacred, and had barely escaped death himself; he was happy to see his sister and
                           bade her adieu
                           with a heavy heart when she started home. She said, 
                           <said id="d196929e3141" who="#astuart">"Rufus, I intend to buy me
                              a home in the west, and you must resign and come and live with me."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3145">He promised her he would come; and they parted, she to return east for one more year
                           in school, he to
                           his regiment and the lovely scenes in the west. On her return, the tornado had swept
                           the train from
                           the track, killing some, wounding many. The wind had caught her up, and from the strength
                           of her
                           clothing had carried her several miles from the place where the train was wrecked.
                           Thus we find her,
                           bruised <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span> and alone, with her ankle dislocated, in this western
                           country, dependent upon strange men for care and protection. Sleep never visited her
                           eyelids that
                           night, such strange emotions thrilled her heart as she lay thinking of the kindness
                           of Dr. Throop.
                           She thought if ever she could love any one on earth, she could love Dr. Throop. Her
                           life had been
                           spent in school; she knew very little of the world, save what she saw in the select
                           circle in which
                           she moved in Baltimore. She was an excellent scholar, speaking French and German fluently.
                           She had
                           no near relatives, and the kind lady with whom she boarded was a good, easy soul,
                           giving Adelaide
                           the privilege of doing as she pleased. She evidently pleased to do that which was
                           right, and in
                           place of being fast, as many city girls in this nineteenth century are, she was in
                           every respect a
                           modest and retiring young lady. She felt that she was placed in a very unpleasant
                           position, but
                           resolved to make the best of her situation, and trust to Dr. Throop's wisdom to direct
                           her right,
                           and his honor to protect her while she was thrown upon his care.

                        <p id="d196929e3150">This was a very wise conclusion, as she could not have found in all the world a man
                           of higher honor
                           or purer sentiment. He was then racking his brains to find how it would be possible
                           to get her some
                           breakfast and convey her to a place where he could procure the necessary attention
                           for her. He hoped
                           she was sleeping, and tip-toeing close to her side he saw the bright black eyes looking
                           up at the
                           stars, with a strange and solemn look.

                        <p id="d196929e3168">She soon felt relieved, and said she felt as if she could sleep; saying,

                        <p id="d196929e3174">He had left her alone through mistaken kindness, thinking she would prefer solitude
                           to company. He
                           had not taken into consideration the severe nervous shock she had undergone, beside
                           the acute
                           suffering she endured. He sat down beside her, and taking her hand in his soothed
                           her with a strange
                           mesmeric power. She soon closed her burning eyes and he saw her gently sink to sleep,
                           with her
                           beautiful hand clasped in his; her fingers tightly clutching his, as her sleep was
                           disturbed by the
                           startling scenes through which she had passed.

                        <p id="d196929e3177">Hour after hour crept by, and the east began to show signs of the coming day. Soon
                           the whole earth
                           was flooded with a thousand glowing sunbeams. The fields were strewn with fragments
                           of the storm;
                           trees were blown across the railroad track, and far as eyes could reach was one scene
                           of desolation;
                           birds and prairie chickens were scattered dead and dying on the plain. Dr. Throop
                           soon espied a
                           covey of poor, scared, drenched prairie fowls. He determined to capture a few of these
                           at any rate.
                           He procured a heavy brush, and rushing upon the unsuspecting flock of birds, he killed
                           nine of them
                           before they could escape. These he gathered up and returned to where the others were.
                           Dick was
                           chasing a large rabbit, which he soon succeeded in capturing. Fortunately Horace had
                           kept a few
                           waterproof matches. They found a piece of plank, made kindling, and soon had a fire
                           blazing
                           brightly, while the blue smoke went curling up through the bracing spring air. The
                           first thing that
                           Dr. Throop did, was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="91" data-tei-n="86"> </a></span> to take Adelaide's dress and wring the water
                           from it, and hang it near the fire to dry. He and Dick then dressed the birds and
                           rabbit and
                           prepared them for cooking. They made sharp sticks and broiled them over the coals.
                           A little salt
                           would have added greatly to their taste, but they had no salt. When they had broiled
                           the birds and
                           dried Adelaide's dress and stockings, they decided to awaken her and see if she could
                           not eat some
                           breakfast.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3182">Dr. Throop approached the place where she lay, and gazed with admiration upon the
                           innocent face
                           upturned to the morning sun. He gently called her. She awoke with a start. and a frightened
                           exclamation. His voice soon assured her of her safety. When she was fully awake, he
                           asked her to try
                           and sit up. She did as he requested her. He then brought her dress and told her to
                           try and put it
                           on. He retired to a distance while she robed herself in her black cashmere, which
                           looked much the
                           worse for its wetting. The Doctor had shaken all the mud from it, but it still presented
                           a very
                           dingy appearance. After she had donned her dress, he took his handkerchief and wet
                           it in a pool of
                           water, and took it to her to wash her hands and face, as it was the only means she
                           had of performing
                           her ablutions. She presented a sorry looking appearance. Her hair hung in long black
                           curls,
                           interspersed with stray leaves and daubs of mud. She tried to be cheerful, and when
                           she was ready to
                           join them at the breakfast, Dr. Throop and Dick lifted up the plank on which she sat
                           and carried her
                           near the fire, where she, with the others. partook of the broiled birds with quite
                           a relish,
                           notwithstanding their lack of salt. The terrible night of suffering through which
                           they passed had
                           left them a sorry looking group. Horace had been worn to a shadow before the storm,
                           and his gloomy
                           face and mournful black eyes were sad to behold; <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="87"> </a></span> Dr. Throop's line
                           face was aglow, with love beaming eyes for the beautiful Adelaide; Dick was hungry,
                           and had but
                           little time to care for his personal appearance. While they gathered around their
                           breakfast, they
                           appeared so ludicrous that each one was compelled to laugh: pretty soon their spirits
                           were restored
                           and they conversed of the storm and their terrible experience. Adelaide recounted
                           how the tornado
                           had lifted the cars from the track, torn them to pieces and sent the occupants whirling
                           through the
                           air. She had no time to observe what became of her traveling companions. The wind
                           caught her up and
                           carried her flying through the air. The first she knew, she was wedged between those
                           limbs, from
                           which she was unable to extricate herself or move until Dr. Throop came to her rescue.
                           She lifted
                           her fine eyes to his glowing face and said, 
                           <said id="d196929e3186" who="#astuart">"Now, kind gentleman, accept my
                              sincere thanks for your kindness in rescuing me from certain death."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3189">Dr. Throop assured her it was a pleasure to him to do her a service in any way. He
                           was considered the
                           leader of the party. Horace inquired of him what course he thought best to pursue.
                           Dr. Throop told
                           him he thought it best that Dick should return to the nearest place where they could
                           obtain help,
                           while he would collect material and erect a kind of hut to protect them from the sun
                           and night dews
                           until help could be procured. He hoped they might obtain help soon, as he knew a relief
                           committee
                           would be sent out to assist the distressed, but he did not as yet know the extent
                           of the storm, and
                           it might have traversed many miles, leaving it a waste place and a desolation. Nevertheless,
                           it was
                           not his theory to borrow trouble; he made it a rule to make the best of everything
                           as he found it,
                           therefore as soon as breakfast was dispatched, Dick started on the back track to obtain
                           aid for the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="93" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span> sufferers, while Dr. Throop busied himself in gathering
                           together limbs and brush to make a temporary tent. He chose a slight elevation on
                           the plain as the
                           site of his western home as he laughingly termed it. He worked manfully, dragging
                           the heavy brush
                           which were very irregular in their dimensions. He finally succeeded in making a tolerably
                           comfortable shed, closed up on the north and west side so as to break off the keen
                           wind, which was
                           piercing cold on that May day. He gathered the finest of the brush and leaves and
                           made a couch in
                           one corner for Adelaide. While he was collecting brush for the hut, he had disturbed
                           a flock of
                           prairie chickens and several rabbits, which he hastily killed. These would provide
                           food for at least
                           two days. He dressed the birds and rabbits, and hung them up in the shade where the
                           purity of the
                           air was sufficient to keep them from tainting. It was now far past the middle of the
                           day, and still
                           no help had appeared. He was anxious to remove Adelaide to her new home; he spread
                           a blanket over
                           the couch and put everything in readiness, but his mind was racked with the thought
                           of how he should
                           convey her there; she was unable to stand alone, much less to step. Horace could not
                           help him carry
                           the plank, as his arms was broken. When he thought of Horace his heart smote him;
                           he had almost
                           forgotten his suffering in caring for Adelaide. He resolved, as soon as he had cared
                           for Adelaide,
                           to make another hut and a couch for Horace, so he could rest; meanwhile, Horace could
                           share
                           Adelaide's tent. He asked Adelaide if she was willing to allow him to carry her to
                           her new home. She
                           said she believed she could walk, by his assistance. Tenderly he supported her to
                           her feet, but the
                           acute pain caused her to sink, white and trembling, to the earth. He gently lifted
                           her in his arms
                           and bore her to her couch of leaves, draped in nature's own handiwork—beautiful <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="89"> </a></span> forest green. She was no light weight—a full grown young lady of
                           eighteen, tall and well developed; she was all the Doctor was able to carry. She praised
                           her room
                           and bed, and thanked him in her sweet womanly way.

                        <p id="d196929e3196">He now sat about preparing their mid-day meal, which was easily done. He had, from
                           time to time,
                           replenished the fire and had a fine lot of coals on which to broil the birds. This
                           done, he carried
                           Adelaide's dinner to her, and left her in the privacy of her own tent. He helped Horace
                           to his

                        <p id="d196929e3201">A faint smile came to Horace's lips, as he said,

                              blows. Frank, you take care that your vessel does not capsize; do not carry too much
                              ballast.
                              What I mean is this, old fellow; do not set your hopes too high. Such game as that
                              is rarely
                              allowed to reach maturity without being captured. She is doubtless in love with some

                              it has been; I should care for any lady, be she young or old, rich or poor, as kindly
                              as I
                              could, under such distressing circumstances as these."

                        <p id="d196929e3212">Horace knew the honest integrity of Dr. Throop's heart, and did not doubt his word.
                           After they had
                           partaken of their dinner Dr. Throop employed himself in erecting a tent similar to
                           the one he had
                           prepared for Adelaide, and by the last faint gleams of the setting sun he had completed
                           the hut. He
                           now prepared supper of the rabbits, saying, laughingly, that they must have a change.

                        <p id="d196929e3215">When twilight fell upon the earth, and one by one the stars came out in their silent
                           beauty, Dr.
                           Throop built a fire on the southern side of the huts, which presented quite a comfortable
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="95" data-tei-n="90"> </a></span> appearance. When it was time to retire, he visited Adelaide's hut, kindly
                           inquiring if there was anything he could do for her. She asked for water, as she had
                           grown thirsty
                           and feverish. During the day Dr. Throop had cut a rude wooden cup from some soft wood;
                           it was
                           roughly fashioned, but it was their only chance for procuring water. He went to a
                           pool of clear
                           water near by,and soon returned with a refreshing drink for her. After she had drank,
                           he brought
                           water and bathed her head, which was hot with fever, and her ankle. which was badly
                           swollen. He felt
                           he had neglected her more during the day than he ought to have done, and resolved
                           to be more careful
                           of her hereafter. He returned to the hut where Horace was sleeping soundly upon his
                           couch of leaves.
                           He sat down by the fire to think over the events of the day. While he sat here, a
                           low growl came to
                           his ear. It was that of a prairie wolf, which had approached near the hut. The sound
                           had reached
                           Adelaide's ears, and she was shaking with terror. She soon found voice enough to call
                           out, saying.
                           
                           <said id="d196929e3219" who="#astuart">"Oh, Dr. Throop, will you please come here!"</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3222">Visions of being destroyed by wild beasts, in her helpless condition, flitted through
                           her feverish
                           brain, and she felt her only safety depended on Dr. Throop's presence. He came immediately
                           in answer
                           to her call. She said, apologetically, while her voice trembled, 
                           <said id="d196929e3224" who="#astuart">"I was afraid
                              of that terrible noise."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3227">He soothed her, telling her it was only the growl of a prairie wolf. Soon the wretched
                           animals made
                           night hideous with their howls. Dr. Throop's strong heart quivered for a moment as
                           he thought of the
                           dreadful fate of any wounded travelers who might be overtaken by a pack of hungry
                           wolves. The
                           terrible storm had driven them from their native haunts and they now wandered in large
                           flocks,
                           devouring all that came in their way. He knew that he could protect Horace and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="96" data-tei-n="91"> </a></span> Adelaide by keeping large fires near the tent to drive them away. He
                           assured Adelaide that she had nothing to fear, telling her to lie still and be calm.
                           He replenished
                           the tires and as they threw out their bright glare, he caught the gleam of hungry
                           wolfish eyes
                           peering at him through the gloom. He now felt that danger threatened them in reality,
                           and he went to
                           Horace's tent and awoke him, telling him he had better come and share Adelaide's room,
                           as he was
                           fearful he could not keep the wolves at bay from both tents much longer. Horace did
                           as directed. Dr.
                           Throop brought the fresh rabbits and birds which he had procured, as he knew their
                           only chance for
                           food depended on them. After he had stored the birds in Adelaide's hut, and Horace
                           had taken a seat
                           in one corner, he worked manfully all night, building a circle of fire around the
                           tent to protect
                           them. Toward morning the snapping and growling of the wolves grew less savage, and
                           with the gleams
                           of the rising sun they slunk away to their hiding places, to be ready to resume their
                           attack with
                           renewed vigor the following night. Morning found Dr. Throop almost exhausted with
                           his hard service
                           of the past two days and nights. His hands were blistered and swollen: his hair and
                           eyebrows singed
                           by his steady night's work at the fires; his broad shoulders ached. and his feet were
                           blistered. For
                           two whole days and nights he had not closed his eyes to sleep, beside his bodily strength
                           had been
                           overtasked, and he was almost sick, yet he knew that he must not give up, as their
                           main dependence
                           was on himself. He proceeded to a pool of water near by, bathed his head and face
                           and felt somewhat
                           refreshed. He then replenished the fire and proceeded to prepare the breakfast in
                           the usual manner.
                           He awakened Horace and Adelaide, then brought fresh water and assisted them in making
                           their toilets
                           for breakfast. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="97" data-tei-n="92"> </a></span> Horace said it looked as if Dr. Throop had a
                           hospital in the wilderness far from human habitation.

                        <p id="d196929e3234">Dr. Throop laughingly answered that they were doing very well, considering the many
                           difficulties they
                           had had to encounter. They chatted pleasantly as they partook of their breakfast,
                           and we will leave
                           them alone awhile and follow the fortunes of Joe Clifford to Leadville, Colorado.

                        <p id="d196929e3263">Joe and his employer set out immediately for Leadville. Mr. Brown was an active business
                           man of the
                           present day; to use an oft quoted expression, everything he touched turned to gold.
                           All manner of
                           speculations prospered in his hands, and Joe seemed equally as fortunate as his employer.
                           They
                           arrived in Denver City, Colorado, before the tornado, and while many were killed,
                           wounded and storm
                           beaten, Joe and his employer were speeding on to the great Eldorado of the west. To
                           Joe, Denver City
                           presented a lovely appearance. It is useless to describe it to my readers; every one
                           knows that
                           Denver is the hub of the western commerce. They collect there to travel north, south
                           and west. All
                           the lines of travel leading to the health and pleasure resorts of Colorado, naturally
                           tend towards
                           Denver City. Added to this large list of travel, are the thousands of people drawn
                           west by the new
                           mining excitement of Leadville. During one week there were four thousand, three hundred
                           and eleven
                           strangers arrived and were registered at the principal hotel. Nor did this represent
                           all the travel
                           into or through Denver. A large portion of the mining travelers were too poor to lodge
                           at the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="99" data-tei-n="94"> </a></span> best hotels, and they sought cheaper lodgings, and spent a day or
                           two in sight-seeing before they proceeded on to Leadville. A restless mind seemed
                           to prevade the
                           whole community. Many rich and well-dressed persons were continually passing to and
                           fro, with
                           pleasant interest in the scenes around, while in strong contrast to these were the
                           eager, striving,
                           hard working ones, who were there to benefit themselves by their trip west. They bore
                           the
                           unmistakable stamp of gold hunters on their countenances. Joe and Mr. Brown passed
                           two days in
                           Denver, sight-seeing, and then proceeded on their way to Leadville. They went by the
                           South Park and
                           Pacific Railroad. The scenery by this route is grand beyond description.. Tall mountains
                           tower
                           toward heaven with their lofty peaks crowned with eternal snow. On one side of this
                           track is the
                           Platte river; away up in the mountains, a tiny rivulet, clear and pellucid, it trickled
                           from a
                           cloven rock and gathered force and power on its downward course, until here, a wild
                           mountain stream,
                           it dashes down through the canon over an almost unbroken succession of rapids and
                           cataracts.
                           Occasionally you come upon a clear pool of water, suggestive of trout-fishing. The
                           rocks rose
                           hundreds of feet on either side, worn by the river into all sorts of wild, unearthly
                           shapes.

                        <p id="d196929e3268">The ride over the Denver, South Park and Pacific is very uncomfortable. Travelers
                           who are used to
                           palace sleeping cars find an all night ride in a narrow gauge car very tiresome; it
                           leaves them in a
                           poor condition to stand fifteen hours of stage-coaching over a rough mountain road.
                           Yet Joe and Mr.
                           Brown had both been used to hard times, and when they reached the terminus of the
                           road they
                           sustained no real injuries, only they were stiff and sore and pretty well stove up
                           with their
                           night's ride. They reached Summit at five o'clock in the morning, and with the motley
                           crowd there,
                           they fried <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="100" data-tei-n="95"> </a></span> their bacon, ate their hard biscuit and made ready to
                           continue their way to the mines. The distance to Leadville was yet thirty miles. The
                           road was
                           thronged with people coming and going to and from the mines. The scene presented a
                           moving mass of
                           human beings, horses, mules and dogs. Some men had their whole families, along with
                           their worldly
                           possessions. There were tired-looking, haggard-faced women; dirty-faced tangled-haired
                           children,
                           with opened mouthed wonder plainly displayed upon their countenances; rough-dressed,
                           bearded and
                           unkempt men thickly mingled in with this heaving, pushing, crowding mass of humanity.
                           Far as eye
                           could see, the crowd swelled and surged onward to its destination. How many hearts
                           ached and eyes
                           grew tired of the grand western scenery and longed again for their little home in
                           the country or
                           small room in the overcrowded city where they might rest and feel satisfied that for
                           one night they
                           would remain free from disturbance. How natural it is, amid scenes of grandeur, surrounded
                           with all
                           the vast displays of nature's sublimest works, for our heart's to return with a sick
                           longing to our
                           first humble home, and we feel ready to cry out in unsatisfied longing for some old
                           familiar
                           scene.

                        <p id="d196929e3274">But time drags on, and we grow accustomed to strange faces and new scenes. The dear
                           old faces and the
                           pleasant old home become memories to us, and the by-gone years fade away, leaving
                           faint traces of
                           our childhood's days clinging to us like the broken fragments of a pleasant dream
                           that fades away
                           with the mists of the morning. Joe looked at the tired, slatternly women and his heart
                           went back in
                           rapid thought to his home in New York city. He thought of his tired mother, of the
                           long years of
                           disappointment and heart sickness she had undergone; of the weary weeks of toiling
                           and hopeless
                           drudgery that she had endured for him, and his <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="101" data-tei-n="96"> </a></span> young heart swelled
                           with bitterness as he thought of his father, and an involuntary curse arose to his
                           lips. But he
                           ground his teeth and crushed it back. He knew his mother was proud and high minded,
                           and the slur
                           that had been put upon her by his father was undeserving. He resolved to seek wealth
                           for her sake.
                           With such pure sentiments of heart-felt love in his heart as these for his mother,
                           there was little
                           danger of Joe being led astray by the many temptations incident to camp life.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3279">After Mr. Brown and Joe had spent a couple of days in Leadville, they went out prospecting
                           with the
                           necessary mining equipments. They determined to go about two hundred miles further
                           and seek a new
                           mining locality. They set out with one gun, pistols and ammunition to do them, and
                           intended to rough
                           it in true western style. They met with many adventures of a trivial nature, crossed
                           mountain
                           streams, climbed over huge bolders of rock firmly imbedded in the earth, peered into
                           deep and dark
                           canons, found a few specimens of gold, but nothing of importance. They killed game
                           in the day time,
                           kindled a fire and broiled their meat, and at night slept beneath the shelter of some
                           large rock or
                           mountain shrubbery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3282">They had now been out two weeks, and had not met with anything like the success they
                           anticipated.
                           They decided to travel one day more, and if they did not meet with better luck in
                           mining, to return
                           to Leadville and set up a store. That night they slept near the mouth of a deep cave.
                           The air was
                           pure and fresh from the mountains. It was now midsummer. Joe slept a sound, healthy
                           sleep, and awoke
                           with the first gleam of the morning light. He decided to kill some fresh game for
                           breakfast; he took
                           his gun, and had gone about fifty yards when he espied on the mountain side <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="102" data-tei-n="97"> </a></span> a large antelope; he drew his gun and fired, wounding the deer; it
                           staggered down the mountain side, lost its footing, and in falling struck against
                           some rocks that
                           were in its way, and loosened them on its downward course. In the mountains it is
                           frequently the
                           case that land-slides occur. Sometimes, where rocks and trees have stood for years,
                           a very slight
                           disturbance in the right direction will cause a weak place to give way, and a tremendous
                           mass of
                           rocks, trees and loose earth will be precipitated into the ravine below. It so happened
                           that the
                           deer, in its fall, struck the right rock. That rock seemed a key to unlock the vast
                           pile of rocks
                           that had rested for centuries, perhaps, waiting for the one disturbing cause in nature
                           to loose its
                           apparently solid foundation. The time had now come, and the whole mountain seemed
                           to be moving. A
                           dangerous mountain slide occurred. It was a terrific scene to Joe. The noise of falling
                           rocks and
                           trees sounded like the roar of thunder. The whole mountain side seemed to be one moving
                           mass of
                           crushing, crumbling ruin of trees, rocks and earth. And what was that gleaming in
                           the rising sun?
                           Long, golden streams of sparkling ore glittered amid the rubbish and debris of that
                           mountain slide.
                           Joe stood awe-stricken, and gazed with solemn admiration upon the scene that was brought
                           into such
                           rapid action by a rifle ball. Suddenly the thought flashed over his mind that this
                           beautiful,
                           glittering mass could be nothing else than gold. He clasped his hands, and with uplifted
                           eyes and
                           grateful heart, said in boyish tones, 
                           <said id="d196929e3286" who="#jclifford">"Thank God! Now mother will not have to
                              lead a slave's life longer. She shall have a home and wealth and fine dresses."
                           </said> The first
                           thoughts that came to him were fraught with joy for his mother's sake. The old <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="103" data-tei-n="98"> </a></span> dread of poverty was gone. He saw, in prospective, a long life of
                           prosperity for his mother and Aunt Mary. He knew his mother was quite a gifted writer,
                           but he felt
                           she had had no opportunity of cultivating her talent for writing. The actual bread
                           and meat of daily
                           life required her whole time. He thought of all these things in less time than I have
                           written
                           it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3292">The noise of the falling trees and rocks had awakened Mr. Brown, who immediately came
                           to where Joe
                           was standing. and then Joe explained how it happened. They soon returned to camp to
                           talk over their
                           wonderful discovery. They prepared their breakfast of dried buffalo meat, and when
                           they had eaten
                           they determined to go to work to get all the gold they could. The mountain deer had
                           been covered by
                           the falling debris from the mountain, and Joe never knew how many feet deep it lay
                           buried. They
                           discovered the mine to be one of nature's richest deposits of golden ore; they found
                           large nuggets
                           of almost pure gold, and within two days they had gathered a large quantity. Then
                           the fear of
                           thieves and mountain robbers came to them, and they had to seek a safe place to conceal
                           their
                           treasure. They concluded to remove it to the cave and fill up the mouth so it would
                           not be easily
                           discovered. Joe worked with untiring energy; visions of a lovely home and elegant
                           surroundings for
                           his mother and Aunt Mary flittered through his mind. He thought of sweet Birdie Elliot
                           as she said,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e3294" who="#belliot">"Joe, you are like the others; you seek gold and care for naught
                              else."
                           </said> He readily forgave Birdie, because she had never known the want of gold as he had.
                           Many a time he had gone cold and hungry, while his mother and Aunt Mary were sick,
                           depriving himself
                           of the necessaries of life to procure the comforts of those dear ones. He would eat
                           the crusts of
                           bread and cold potatoes and drink <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="98"> </a></span> a cup of water without
                           complaint. Not but what Joe had a good appetite; he craved the nice roast beef and
                           dainty fare that
                           filled the rich man's table, and thought if hard work and economy could some time
                           procure him a good
                           home and plenty to eat he would have it. They soon succeeded in stowing away their
                           treasure from
                           sight, but there and then went to work anew to dig for more. They killed a mountain
                           deer and had
                           fresh venison roasted for each day's meal.

                        <p id="d196929e3300">Here for several weeks they worked faithfully; they built high hopes of future greatness.
                           Joe's
                           highest ambition was to procure a home for his mother, and after that he meant to
                           build a home for
                           overworked and homeless women and girls. He had seen much suffering in the city among
                           the working
                           class of women. When they became ill or unable to work for a time they still had to
                           pay rent for the
                           crowded tenement rooms, and had not a breath of fresh air or a taste of wholesome
                           food to nourish
                           their worn out bodies.

                        <p id="d196929e3303">Boy as he was, he had exalted ideas of doing something to benefit his race. He would
                           often talk to
                           himself, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e3305" who="#jclifford">"Yes, I will do some good in my life; I will buy the old
                              place where I was born and where the little cottage now stands, and I will build an
                              elegant home
                              for tired and overworked women and girls. Boys can help themselves but girls can not.
                              There were
                              only boys sent west, while the poor girls were left cooped up in that bed of iniquity
                              and
                              compelled to toil at starvation prices. Is it any wonder they lose heart, purity and
                              nobility of
                              soul and become the poor squalid creatures they do in a few years. They are often
                              tempted by
                              rich men's offers, and they see no outlet to their miserable lives, nothing but work
                              and
                              starvation, and, after a time, a rest in the potter's field. I would not have them
                              live in
                              idleness, but I would have them well fed and well nourished in body and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="105" data-tei-n="100"> </a></span> mind; and when they work they will work with a nerve and energy that
                              is well both for the employer and the employed."

                        <p id="d196929e3311">Joe had been a close observer in the city; he had seen hundreds of women, like his
                           mother and Aunt
                           Mary, striving to keep the wolf from the door. He had seen them stricken down with
                           sickness, and
                           they were compelled to face poverty and endure much hardship and privation, that a
                           little help from
                           the wealthy would have alleviated. It was, indeed, a noble plan Joe had in his mind,
                           and one well
                           worthy of a high and noble nature. Mr. Brown was ambitious to accumulate much wealth
                           and become a
                           second Astor or Vanderbilt. So each, with his mind filled with visions of future good
                           or greatness,
                           toiled, dug and delved from early morn till late at night to amass a fortune. They
                           held the claim by
                           the right of discovery, and nature had assisted them in unearthing large rocks and
                           laying bare its
                           vast wealth to their eager hands. The fortunate shot at the mountain deer had been
                           the cause of
                           saving many hard days' work. There were large veins of golden ore laid bare in one
                           hours' time, but
                           there was great danger in procuring it, as the earth still kept caving in at intervals,
                           leaving
                           great sink-holes that appeared to be bottomless. They were also in daily fear of being
                           discovered
                           and robbed. They left an opening at the mouth of the cave large enough for Joe to
                           enter each night
                           and store away their day's gatherings. Joe noticed a luxuriant green vine, similar
                           to the woodbine,
                           growing over the rocks and trees in the vicinity. He dug up several of these vines
                           and planted them
                           so they grew over the opening in the rock. He watered them every day from the fresh
                           mountain stream
                           that flowed near by, and soon the whole mouth of the cave presented the appearance
                           of a solid rock
                           overgrown with ivy. And now we will leave <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="101"> </a></span> them to enjoy their
                           surroundings and improve their fortunes, while we return to George Kent at the farmer's

                           breakfast they
                           resumed their journey. Mr. Howe was anxious to make all haste to the nearest station,
                           so he could go
                           on to his home in the mountains. He was doing Government service, and it was necessary
                           he should be
                           at head quarters in a certain time, as he was appointed to meet other Government officers.

                           passing. To
                           Clement Howe there was an unspoken pleasure in the society of George Kent; there was
                           something so
                           kind and obedient in the boy's manner. He looked at the slender little form and patient
                           face, and
                           thought, surely George had had a hard time in New York city. Clement Howe was about
                           thirty-five
                           years of age. He was of a high and wealthy family; he was a graduate from Harvard
                           College; was a
                           distinguished scholar, and heir to a large property. He had all that heart could desire
                           or wealth
                           procure. He traveled in Europe and returned to New York city, where he fell in love
                           with a beautiful
                           young lady. She favored his suit, her friends were highly pleased with her prospects,
                           the wedding
                           day was set, and Clement was happy in anticipation of wedded bliss. When the wedding
                           day dawned the
                           woeful discovery was made that his false love had eloped with her music master, who
                           had courted her
                           for years. This so thoroughly disgusted Clement Howe that he retired from society
                           and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="109" data-tei-n="104"> </a></span> became almost a recluse. Finally he went west, and had not been heard
                           from for years. He had one sister, older than himself; she was married, the wife of
                           Mr. Elliot, and
                           mother of Birdie, Joe's much-loved little friend. His sister was entirely absorbed
                           in fashionable
                           life, and her brother concluded all women were a vain and heartless set. After he
                           had gone west he
                           was appointed to a government office. He frequently made trips to Washington City
                           on business, and
                           then immediately returned to his home in the Rocky mountains, which he had named "Eagle's
                           Eyrie," on
                           account of the almost inaccessible route to his home on the mountain side. Here he
                           had spent years
                           in adorning and improving his home, which resembled some beautiful palace. West of
                           it the tall peaks
                           of the Rocky mountains gleamed in the sunlight; on the east flowed a clear, pellucid
                           stream of
                           water, abounding in trout and bordered on each side with beautiful forest trees, magnificent
                           in
                           their towering height. Bowlders of rock projected out over the stream, covered with
                           mountain ivy, a
                           vine peculiar to that country.

                        <p id="d196929e3416">This river was fed by the never-failing mountain streams, and dashed over the rocks
                           with reckless
                           freedom, scattering the silver spray on its downward course. To the south was one
                           long rich valley
                           of undulating land, fertile as the Valley of the Shenandoah in Virginia. This valley,
                           with thousands
                           of acres of government land, had been purchased by Clement Howe when he first came
                           west. Here, on
                           the mountain side, he had reared, at an enormous cost, a residence almost palatial
                           in its grandeur.
                           This home, and the immense amount of land belonging to it, had gained for him the
                           name of the Rocky
                           Mountain King. The main building was one hundred feet in length in its front, of solid
                           white marble.
                           It was double storied, with a long balcony extending the whole <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="110" data-tei-n="105"> </a></span>
                           front of it. There was one main entrance, at the massive oaken hall door. Beautiful
                           plate glass
                           windows extended to the floor, and opened out on the balcony. He had been years in
                           completing this
                           building, and it had cost a fabulous sum of money. The yard was enclosed by a solid
                           stone fence
                           overgrown with ivy, and was elegant with costly shrubs and flowers that would flourish
                           in that
                           climate. The inside of the house contained eighteen large rooms, all well furnished
                           and with taste
                           to rival some of the elegant mansions on Fifth avenue in New York city. The dining
                           room was gleaming
                           with marble-top sideboards that were covered with costly silver and Sevres china.
                           Clement had
                           brought things with him from the east, and fitted up this home. They had been brought
                           by railroad as
                           far as its terminus; thence conveyed over the rough mountain road by wagons to "Eagle's
                           Eyrie." He
                           had two male servants and one female—Aunt Hope, Uncle Abel and their son John. They
                           were left in
                           charge of the premises when he was absent. While he was at home they prepared his
                           meals, ministered
                           to his comfort and looked upon 
                           <hi id="d196929e3420" style="; ">"Marse Clement"</hi> as the combination of all
                           good and great beings. His library was well stored with the best books. Aunt Hope
                           declared there had
                           been four wagon loads

                        <p id="d196929e3427">Toward this home Clement was now anxiously wending his way. He knew it would take
                           one day's travel to
                           the nearest station, then two days' travel by railroad, and three on horseback would
                           bring them to
                           his mountain home. He was anxious to reach home on George's account. He saw that his
                           strength was
                           only fictitious, and he had felt a strong affection spring up in his heart for this
                           delicate,
                           black-eyed boy. He had been so long and so far removed from human affection that he
                           caught himself
                           building air castles of how he would <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="111" data-tei-n="106"> </a></span> teach George to shoot and
                           hunt mountain deer and buffalo and ride his thoroughbred horses.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3432">Clement Howe had denied himself nothing in the way of living; he had a stable well
                           filled with the
                           finest blood horses in the west—not so fine perhaps as Linden Tree or Leopard, that
                           were presented
                           to General Grant by the Sultan of Turkey, but fine horses for all that; strong, beautiful,
                           sure-footed and well adapted to the rough mountain roads, wide-spreading plains and
                           fertile valleys
                           of the west. Wildfire, a splendid black, with quivering nostrils, fiery eye and flowing
                           mane and
                           tail, was his master's favorite. Fleetfoot, Van Wert and Bayard were all fine horses,
                           and so well
                           groomed by old Uncle Abel and John that they were aching for a race over the plains.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3435">Clement left orders for Abel to meet him at the railroad terminus with a horse for
                           him to ride
                           home.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3438">Uncle Abel obeyed orders, and was now at the terminus waiting for his master. The
                           storm had delayed
                           his coming, but old Abe knew when Clement left the word he meant for him to stay until
                           he arrived.
                           So he stabled Wildfire and Van Wert and lounged around the town, gathering all the
                           news. He heard of
                           the terrible tornado that had destroyed so much property and so many lives, and he
                           said to himself,

                           them two large
                           baskets of provisions, which were very acceptable. Clement carried one and Silas the
                           other. They
                           stopped at a pool of water, partook of their dinner, rested themselves and then resumed
                           their
                           journey until they were compelled to camp out. They built two fires; Clement and George
                           sat by one
                           fire, Silas and Marinda at the other. Silas offered to keep guard the first part of
                           the night, but
                           Clement bade him sleep and he would call him in the after part of the night. George
                           offered to keep
                           guard a part of the night, to which Clement kindly replied,

                              with your
                              feet to the fire and rest; remove your shoes so your feet can rest."

                        <p id="d196929e3471">George removed the coarse, boy shoes that had blistered his feet; lay down as Clement
                           directed, and
                           was soon fast asleep, overcome by fatigue and weakness. Silas and Marinda soon gave
                           evidence of
                           their happy condition by the loud snoring they emitted. Clement sat alone, keeping
                           guard over <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="113" data-tei-n="108"> </a></span> the strange group he had taken charge of. His heart clung to the
                           strange boy with a tenderness he had never before experienced. He said to himself,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e3475" who="#chowe">"It will not be long until the fresh mountain air of Eagle's Eyrie will bring the

                              about
                              eleven years old. What tiny little hands and feet he has! and how he ever managed
                              to hold my
                              head and shoulders above water is more than I can understand."
                           </said> It had indeed been quite
                           an effort for George to hold him up, but his little shoulders had grown strong by
                           the constant use
                           of the blacking brush in New York city, and instead of a boy of eleven he was a girl
                           of almost
                           sixteen years of age, and her naturally tender heart had caused her to use every effort
                           to ward off
                           suffering from any one. But Clement knew nothing of this; if he had really at the
                           time suspicioned
                           Georgie was a girl, he would have returned her to the borders of civilization secured
                           her a home in
                           some good family and paid for her schooling, as he could not forget the service she
                           had done him in
                           saving his life. He was ignorant of George's sex, and so he went on building air castles,
                           and
                           thinking what a friend he would have in his home on the mountain side. George stirred

                           </said> Jerushy's ill treatment and abuse had hurt him and still clung to his fevered
                           brain. He tossed restlessly on the blanket, and talked on, 
                           <said id="d196929e3484" who="#gkent">"Oh, I will not get
                              sick, I

                        <p id="d196929e3490">Clement's heart was touched by the pathetic tone of the boy. He approached him and
                           found him feverish
                           and delirious. He brought water and bathed the burning head and gently roused him
                           from his feverish
                           dreams. George started up, clasped Clement's hands with his little brown, feverish
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="114" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span> hands and cried out: 
                           <said id="d196929e3494" who="#gkent">"Oh, don't leave me, Mr. Howe; I
                              am

                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3503">Clement soothed him and told him he would not leave him, and inwardly blamed himself
                           for allowing the
                           boy to walk so far in his weak condition. George soon sank to rest, and toward morning
                           his fever
                           cooled again. Clement secured a piece of plank, and after they had eaten their breakfast,
                           he
                           directed Marinda to carry the basket with the remainder of the food, and told Silas
                           he wanted him to
                           assist him in carrying George to the station, a distance of five miles. He then requested
                           George to
                           sit upon the plank while he carried one end of it and Silas the other. In this novel
                           manner they
                           proceeded on their way. George was too weak to stand alone, and Clement knew if he
                           could get him to
                           the station he could then procure medicine for him.

                        <p id="d196929e3506">They arrived at the station just in time to go on their way. Clement sat on the seat
                           beside George
                           and supported his head on his shoulder. He soon fell asleep; the motion of the cars
                           lulled him to
                           rest and Clement cared for him as tenderly as a mother would care for her child. He
                           observed the
                           coarse, rough clothes of the boy and determined to procure him some fine wearing apparel
                           at the
                           railroad terminus, as it was quite an enterprising town, and he could obtain almost
                           anything he
                           wished in the clothing line for a large price. When they arrived at the station they
                           found Uncle
                           Abel waiting impatiently for his master's arrival.

                        <p id="d196929e3509">Abel was much surprised to see the persons who accompanied his master. He had brought
                           a little sickly

                           of addressing
                           Clement as master. He had drifted west with the tide of emigration and Clement had
                           picked him up at
                           some of the western towns and taken him and his wife and son to his mountain home.
                           He had treated
                           them kindly, paying them for their service by the year. He told Uncle Abe to call

                           Abel fell into his old time habit of addressing white men, and called him master.

                           Wildfire and carried George before him, as he was unable to sit alone on horseback.

                        <p id="d196929e3527">Clement transacted his business in town, and was soon mounted with his crowd of attendants
                           and on his
                           way to "Eagle's Eyrie." Wildfire was proud of his master, and his easy, graceful motion
                           was soothing
                           to George's aching body. They traveled along the rough mountain road at an easy pace.
                           They had to
                           camp out one night more before they reached home. Abe had brought the necessary camping
                           articles and
                           a well-filled hamper of food along. No accident occurred on the way, and the next

                           master brought
                           home, but nevertheless much pleased to see their beloved master. He ordered a pleasant
                           room on the
                           second floor made ready for George. He assisted him to the room and ordered a bath
                           for him. He sent
                           to his room a fine suit of deep blue broadcloth, with spotless white linen shirts
                           and fine patent
                           leather shoes. He told George these clothes were for him, and when he was rested to
                           ring for John,
                           and give orders for any thing he wanted, saying;

                           pillow, and wierd shadows seemed drifting around her. She awoke in a room richly furnished;
                           a
                           beautiful Axminister carpet covered the floor; the furniture was rich and heavy. The
                           room had a
                           southern view, and the windows were open to admit the fresh air. She felt as if she

                           afraid her sex would be discovered, and Mr. Howe would turn her out of doors as an
                           imposter. Poor

                           was in a strange house in the mountains, far distant from any habitation, and her
                           only companions
                           were to be servants and the man whose life she had saved. She could not bear the idea

                           her secret to him, and, thanks to his kindness, she would not have to room with any
                           one. He had left
                           John at her command as her servant, but she was so well used to waiting on herself
                           she did not need
                           a valet. She smiled at the idea. She, a little New York boot-black, established at
                           a fine residence
                           in the west, with a man-servant to wait upon her! She wished with all her heart that
                           she was a boy.
                           She gazed away to the sparkling river as it flowed on its eastern course, and turning
                           her eyes she
                           saw in the valley to the south large herds of buffalo feeding on the rich grasses
                           there. She lay a
                           long time thinking of her position, and longing for some friend in whom she could
                           confide.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3593">At length she determined to be contented and make the best of her life. She believed
                           she could
                           conceal her sex from Mr. Howe. She had so much reverence in her heart for the stately,
                           blue-eyed man
                           that treated her with so much kindness and consideration, she longed to hide her face
                           in her hands
                           and tell him she was not what she seemed; that circumstances had so formed and fashioned
                           her life
                           that she was compelled to occupy a false position, but she knew that would never do.
                           She thought she
                           could live here in this wilderness. and grow better and stronger; she dreaded the
                           thought of having
                           to learn to shoot and ride horseback. She did not dread the use of firearms so much
                           as she did the
                           thought of riding those fiery looking horses. Georgie was, by nature, a delicate,
                           high-toned maiden,
                           whose modesty was a safeguard <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="119" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span> to her, and she shrank from any
                           display much less than the place she would have to take as companion to Mr. Howe.
                           She determined,
                           however, to make the effort to conceal her sex, and here in this mountain fastness
                           to live with him
                           as a male companion forever. She arose, took a bath, arrayed herself in the blue broadcloth
                           Mr. Howe
                           had sent, and looked very sweet and girlish for a boy. The delicate little rosebud
                           of a mouth had a
                           grieved expression, and the eyes a patient sadness, which you seldom see in a boy
                           of eleven or
                           twelve years of age. She brushed back the black curls from the beautiful brow and
                           sat down to think
                           before she should descend to the lower room. Soon a knock sounded at the door. She
                           arose, opened the
                           door, and John, bowing his woolly head, said,

                        <p id="d196929e3602">George arising, told him to lead the way. He led the way down the stairs to the elegantly
                           furnished
                           room. Clement Howe fairly started as the beautiful boy entered the room. There was
                           a beauty, style
                           and grace displayed by the boy never before noticed. The coarse, ill-fitting suit
                           of tweed had given
                           him a puny, delicate appearance, while the fine blue broad-cloth suit greatly enhanced
                           his delicate
                           beauty.

                        <p id="d196929e3605">Clement advanced to meet him with outstretched hands saying,

                        <p id="d196929e3610">A crimson flush mounted to George's white brow as Clement drew him to his side and
                           folded him in his
                           arms, saying,

                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3617">Clement's great heart was hungry for something to love: something to cling to in his
                           loneliness, and
                           he placed high hopes on this boy, who had saved his life. George released herself
                           from the arms of
                           Clement, and blushingly said: 
                           <said id="d196929e3619" who="#gkent">"Dear Mr. Howe, you are the first real friend I
                              ever knew: my life has been so lonely, so desolate, amid the vast city's crowded throng,
                              I had
                              no friend to call my own. I will strive to deserve the honor you have bestowed upon
                              me by making
                              me your friend, and I sincerely hope you may never regret it."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3622">
                           <said id="d196929e3623" who="#chowe">"Do not fear I shall regret it; Clement Howe does nothing to regret."</said> And
                           this was really true; he was of so high a mind, and of a character so pure, that he
                           was not tempted
                           to do things to regret. He was so evenly balanced, with such a grand heart in his
                           manly bosom, a
                           person felt in looking at him, he was a man to be trusted among a thousand. He bade
                           George be seated
                           at the table, where every dainty that wealth could procure was spread to tempt the
                           appetite and
                           please the mind. Fine Sevres of china dishes, with cut glass and silver, adorned the
                           table in the
                           center of the room. In the center of the table stood an elegant vase filled with fresh
                           rosebuds and
                           glossy fern leaves that had been gathered from the yard; fresh broiled venison steaks
                           were sending
                           forth a grateful odor to tempt the appetite; nice trout from the mountain stream was
                           fried, brown
                           and tempting, and served with vegetables and fruit. There was fresh butter manufactured
                           at the home
                           dairy, and delicious cream biscuit made by Aunt Hope. George partook of a venison
                           steak, some of the
                           biscuit, drank a cup of fragrant tea, and felt much better. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="116"> </a></span> After
                           dinner they repaired to the piazza in front of the house. where Clement indulged in
                           smoking a
                           fragrant cigar, and George sat drinking in, to his soul's content, the beauties of
                           his mountain
                           home. He felt his heart expand and swell in grateful affection for the friend who
                           sat near him for
                           treating him so kindly, and he determined to be worthy of that affection. Uncle Abe
                           and Silas were
                           engaged in tending to the stock, while Aunt Hope and Marinda were engaged in the household
                           duties.

                        <p id="d196929e3685">When their work was completed they went to their room. where Marinda talked to her
                           heart's content of
                           the terrible trials she had undergone since she had left Mississippi as a refugee
                           for Kansas.

                        <p id="d196929e3688">As the evening advanced, and the mountain air grew chilly, Clement and George repaired
                           to the parlor,
                           where a bright fire was built of coal and pine wood, sending out the delightful odor
                           of burning
                           pine. Here they sat for sometime longer, Clement busy with some papers, George gazing
                           dreamily into
                           the fire, and contrasting his present luxurious life with his miserable, half-starved
                           existence in
                           New York. When Clement had overlooked his papers, he turned to George and saw the
                           beautiful,
                           childish face deep in thought. The tine eyes were bent in serious thought upon the
                           blazing fire; the
                           little mouth was compressed with a steady, firm look, that bespoke his power of suffering
                           and
                           self-control; the delicate little brown hands were clasped as if in patient waiting.
                           Clement ged for
                           a few moments upon the sweet-faced boy, and then said 
                           <said id="d196929e3690" who="#chowe">"A penny for your thoughts,
                              George; but why do I ask? Of course you are thinking of New York, and longing for

                              associates there. Who would you rather see in the city ?"

                              We parted
                              at Parsons, Kansas, and I have not heard from him since. Then I met you, Mr. Howe,

                              you are my best and only friend on earth. You so kindly offered me a home here. I

                              here alone, apart from the world. Years ago my fondest hopes were all blasted. I loved
                              a lady,
                              sweet and fair to look upon, but cruel and heartless beyond all description. She deserted
                              me for
                              another man on the eve of our marriage. I learned to despise her, and with my contempt
                              for her
                              came a hatred for all women. Yet I feel I must have some one to love, and no one suits
                              me so
                              well, my dear boy, as yourself. If you were a girl I could not bear you in my sight,
                              but you are
                              a boy; you do not belong to the treacherous sex; you shall share my home, my heart,
                              my wealth,
                              my studies, and my pleasures. It will be my highest delight to see you mounted on
                              Fleetfoot,
                              skimming over the valleys, or with a rifle picking out some bird at a distance to
                              lay at my feet
                              as a trophy and proof of your ability to shoot well. I myself will conduct your studies.
                              I will
                              teach you music. In the parlor is one of Steinway's grand pianos that is equal to
                              a band when
                              well played."

                        <p id="d196929e3719">It was well for George the firelight had flickered low in the room, and he turned
                           his burning face
                           aside as he listened to Mr. Howe's conversation and plans. What could he do! a girl,
                           the very
                           identical creature Mr. Howe despised! Should he come boldly out and declare the truth
                           by telling Mr.
                           Howe of his wretched life. He felt he was deceiving his best friend, taking advantage
                           of the
                           kindness offered him, because he was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="124" data-tei-n="119"> </a></span> supposed to be a boy, when
                           he was that despicable creature in Mr. Howe's eyes—
                           <hi id="d196929e3723" style="font-variant: small-caps;">A GIRL</hi>. He thought of his hard
                           life in New York city, of his miserable sufferings at Jerushy's, of Mr. Howe's condemnation
                           of all
                           women, and George resolved to conceal his sex at all hazards, and make believe he
                           was a veritable
                           boy forever.

                        <p id="d196929e3727">Clement continued to talk to him of his plans, all unconscious of the pain he was
                           inflicting on the
                           delicate little girl, who was homeless and friendless, save for himself. Clement Howe
                           was a
                           noble-hearted man, but he believed himself to have been basely used by a woman, and
                           his mind was
                           embittered against the sex. If he had known George was a girl; if he had seen that
                           poor little
                           innocent girl stuggling to support herself; if he could have known the weary days
                           and sleepless
                           nights that young creature had passed, because she was a girl in a false position,
                           he would have
                           died sooner than wound her feelings by unkind remarks against her sex. But he firmly
                           believed she
                           was a boy, and one to whom he owed a heavy debt of gratitude. He thought he would
                           give the boy to
                           understand he had no rival to fear; that all he was required to do the remainder of
                           his days, was to
                           live with him and be happy.

                        <p id="d196929e3730">With sinking heart and faltering words George stammered out his thanks to his benefactor.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3733">Clement attributed his emotion to weakness, and said kindly,

                        <p id="d196929e3738">George went obediently to Clement's side, but did not ofier to salute him with a kiss.
                           Clement put
                           his arm about him him, drew him to his side, and kissing his cheek, said,

                              no thought
                              of the morrow, for the 'Old Eagle' always cares for its young, and rest assured I
                              shall care for
                              you."

                        <p id="d196929e3745">George left the parlor and retired to his own room, and there, in the privacy of his
                           own chamber, he
                           burst into an uncontrollable fit of weeping. His heart was full to breaking; he had
                           held back the
                           passionate sobs as long as he could; he knew Clement believed him to be a boy, and
                           his heart was
                           heavy because he had deceived him. When he had ceased weeping, he sat in an easy chair
                           by the window
                           and gazing away into the deep and starry silence of the night, wondered if any one
                           on earth was half
                           so miserable as himself. The dread of those fiery horses made his heart stand still
                           with terror. He
                           knew Clement would expect him to manage them with the ease and freedom of a boy. He
                           resolved to do
                           the best he could with the horses, when the time came; he felt the studies would only
                           be a pastime,
                           and music was his soul's delight. His fingers ached to touch that piano and draw grand
                           strains of
                           music from its ivory keys.

                        <p id="d196929e3749">George had no gentle mother to teach him the Lord's prayer, but he had a high, pure
                           soul, and a deep
                           adoration in his heart for the maker of the universe, and when his grief had subsided,
                           he knelt at
                           the window and seriously and earnestly besought the father of mercies to care for
                           him in the trying
                           conflict through which he must pass. He arose comforted and strengthened, trusting
                           in him who is a
                           present help in every time of need. He then retired to rest and the sleep of the innocent
                           soon
                           wafted him away to the land of dreams.

                        <p id="d196929e3752">Clement sat a long time in meditation after George had <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="126" data-tei-n="121"> </a></span> left him;
                           he reviewed his past life and laid new plans for the future; he was happier than he
                           had been for
                           years; he felt a strange joy in the companionship of George; he mused on the delicate
                           features and
                           timid ways of the boy, but he felt there was a high principle and a strong will underlying
                           that
                           delicate exterior; he talked to himself, a habit he had acquired from being alone
                           so much, saying,

                              to have had
                              such a son, but it was not to be; women as a class are heartless, cruel; I could not

                              myself to seek another when Helen, whom I thought was the soul of honor, betrayed
                              me. But I will
                              not grieve; I must sleep."

                        <p id="d196929e3800">When night again descended over the plain, Dr. Throop felt as if he would not be able
                           to hold battle
                           with the prairie demons another night. But love nerved up his strong right arm and
                           made him strong
                           to suffer and to do; he knew it would not do to let Adelaide suffer, even in thought,
                           as she was in
                           a very precarious condition. His experienced eye could detect a weakness of the spine
                           that might
                           terminate fatally if she was allowed to become excited or overcome. He felt the fever
                           in his blood,
                           with a pain and dizziness in his head, but would not allow himself to give up. He
                           dragged his tired
                           limbs to a pool of fresh water near by, procured fresh water for Adelaide, and then
                           proceeded to
                           broil some of the birds for supper.

                        <p id="d196929e3803">Horace was anxious about his friend, and earnestly requested him to lie down and rest
                           after supper,
                           saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e3805" who="#chowe">"Frank, in my selfishness I have allowed you to do all the hard work, and
                              last night you never closed your eyes in sleep. Now I demand that you take some
                              rest."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e3809">Adelaide also joined Horace in his request, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e3811" who="#astuart">"Dr. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="128" data-tei-n="123"> </a></span> Throop, I feel that we are safe, encircled, as we are, by a ring of
                              fire. Those wild beasts will hardly venture through fire, let them be ever so
                              hungry."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3816">Thus importuned, Frank lay down on the couch of leaves in the room adjoining Adelaide's.
                           He soon sank
                           into a heavy dreamless sleep, from which he was aroused about midnight by the fierce
                           howling of
                           hungry wolves. He sprang to his feet, grasped a firebrand from the blazing fire and
                           soon had the
                           satisfaction of hearing the howls grow more distant. Horace Clifford, with his arm
                           in a sling, had
                           worked manfully all night keeping the fire replenished. Adelaide had slept but little.
                           She had
                           become anxious about Dr. Throop. She had never before met with a man who commanded
                           her admiration
                           and respect as the Doctor did; she knew nothing of love, unless the strange happiness
                           in her heart
                           could be called love; she felt very weak and nervous, but she had a will to overcome
                           nervousness;
                           she hoped they would soon be rescued from their painful position, but she did not
                           know how long they
                           might be left alone.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3819">Dr. Throop felt somewhat refreshed from his sleep, and when he had succeeded in driving
                           the wolves
                           away he insisted that Horace should retire and seek some rest while he remained on
                           guard until
                           daylight. Horace did as the Doctor requested him, and was soon sleeping.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3822">Adelaide remained silent for sometime, but at last, tired and lonely, she asked Dr.
                           Throop if he
                           would not assist her to her feet and let her sit by the fire with him. This he readily
                           consented to
                           do, carefully wrapping her in the blanket to protect her from the night air. They
                           did not talk much
                           at first, but sat silent and thoughtful.

                        <p id="d196929e3825">Dr. Throop felt the presence of Adelaide as some sweet, inexpressible power, that
                           was to lead him to
                           a haven of rest. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="129" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span> Presently he remarked,

                           </said> and she replied, 
                           <said id="d196929e3832" who="#astuart">"No; I was on my return from a visit in the west, when the storm overtook us. And

                           <said id="d196929e3835" who="#astuart">"have not told me if you, Mr. Clifford and Dick were

                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3838">He told her of his setting out to trace his sister's child: how they had traced him
                           to the farm
                           house, and had then lost sight of him, and said he was fearful the boy had perished
                           in the
                           storm.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3842">Adelaide's gentle heart ached in sympathy for the brother and uncle, who had looked
                           so long and
                           anxiously for his sister, and then when he found her child, to feel that it was in
                           a perilous
                           situation, in danger of being devoured by wild beasts. Her heart sank when she thought
                           of that
                           lonely child exposed to the storm and the terrible wolves. She felt how helpless she
                           was and show
                           she might have died alone had it not been for the timely aid of Dr. Throop and his
                           kind care of her
                           since. She felt they must soon part, and a feeling of desolation crept over her. Her
                           whole life had
                           been devoted to her weak brother, who, in an hour of temptation, allowed himself to
                           yield to sin and
                           commit an act that was to trail its shadow over her whole life. She felt Dr. Throop
                           was a high and
                           noble man, and could not look with the eyes of affection and foregiveness, as she
                           did, upon her
                           erring brother. She felt there was a secret she must forever keep locked in her own
                           bosom. She did
                           not tell him who she had been visiting in the west. He did not press the question
                           further; his noble
                           heart and trusting nature was ready always to believe the best of every one. When
                           he saw any one
                           suffering he did not stop to inquire who they were or from whence they came, but like
                           the good
                           Samaritan of olden times, he bound up the bleeding wounds and poured on the healing
                           oil, never
                           waiting to make <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="130" data-tei-n="125"> </a></span> inquiries. He felt Miss Stuart had been cast in
                           his way by some strange providence, and he looked upon her as a precious charge. He
                           longed to take
                           her in his arms and pour a tale of pure and honest love into her ear. But respect
                           for her feelings
                           and his own high notions of honor forbade his taking undue advantage of her lonely
                           condition. He
                           looked upon her sweet, pale face and felt no language of his could speak the love
                           he felt; he
                           realized, that

                           his feelings.
                           He was not aware that love has a language of its own, that speaks in many varied ways—the
                           glance of

                           Old, yet

                           the first tender
                           love of woman's heart, like the delicate unfolding of a sweet spring rose—one by one

                           glowing in the eyes, the sweet quivering notes of gladness trilling in the voice,
                           and speaking a
                           language that naught but love can utter. Reader, have you seen some fair girl giving
                           her heart, all
                           unconsciously, into the keeping of a stranger? Such was now the case with Adelaide.
                           She had learned
                           to love Dr. Throop in the few short days of their acquaintance with the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="126"> </a></span> love of a lifetime, and she felt she must guard herself strictly or she
                           would betray her secret. She grew silent, and sat looking in the fire with a heavy
                           sadness gathering
                           in her glorious black eyes.

                           plain, far removed from human habitation, with naught but the twinkling stars from

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3983">That morning was to Dr. Throop the happiest morning of his hitherto pleasant life.
                           He went about
                           preparing the breakfast merry as a boy. He raked up fresh coals, broiled the birds,
                           then called
                           Horace to his breakfast. They were not very hungry: this was the third morning since
                           the storm, and
                           they had grown tired of their bill of fare. They had not heard a word from Dick, but
                           they expected
                           him back to-day. Horace looked more depressed and out of heart than usual this morning.
                           He felt that
                           his life was entirely hopeless; his arm had been painful during the night; his breakfast
                           did not
                           tempt him—broiled birds without salt, as a regular diet, was not the best of eating.
                           To the lovers,
                           it mattered little what they ate, they were so absorbed with each other. Horace wandered
                           aimlessly
                           about till noon.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3986">Dick made his appearance at noon with a large express wagon and a span of good horses,
                           and the storm
                           wrecked party were soon on their return to the nearest town. Horace and Dick occupied
                           the front
                           seat; Dr. Throop and Adelaide the back one. As they journeyed along at slow stages,
                           Dr. Throop felt
                           it would be impossible to separate himself from <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="135" data-tei-n="130"> </a></span> Adelaide, and he
                           did not feel like abandoning his sister's lost child. His brain was busy thinking,
                           planning, and he
                           resolved to urge Adelaide to a speedy marriage. He tore a leaf from his note book
                           and wrote a note
                           to her asking her consent to an immediate union. The presence of the others forbade
                           any private
                           conversation, and this was his only way of asking so important a question. Adelaide
                           blushed as she
                           read, and sadly shook her head, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e3990" who="#astuart">"It is too soon."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e3994">But with all a lover's impatience, he urged her to become his wife as soon as they
                           arrived at the
                           nearest town. She finally consented. That evening late they arrived at a small railroad
                           town, where
                           Dr. Throop procured a marriage license, and called on a justice of the peace to unite
                           them. Adelaide
                           was very pale; her recent suffering and the trials she had undergone, left their traces
                           on her sweet
                           face. Dr. Throop was flushed and glowing with a happy and triumphant heart. He loved
                           this woman with
                           all the strength of a nature like his, and she was now his own. She had given him
                           the highest proof
                           of woman's love to man, and stood by his side his lawful, wedded wife.

                        <p id="d196929e3997">Horace Clifford looked gloomily on, thinking ever of his beloved and ill used Austria.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4000">Dick was happy as a witness of this strange wedding. He remarked,

                                 together."

                        <p id="d196929e4006">Passers-by stopped to gaze at the lovely bride. One lady at the boarding house remarked,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4008">"She

                        <p id="d196929e4011">This smote on the ear of Adelaide, and sent a chill to her heart, but the doctor whispered,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4013" who="#fthroop">"Never mind the dress, darling; <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="136" data-tei-n="131"> </a></span> you can soon
                              change its sombre hue for one more suitable for a bride."
                           </said> She returned the fond pressure
                           of the hand, and felt she was willing to be wed in any dress that would make her the
                           wife of her
                           only love.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4019">The ceremony was soon over that joined two lives together for weal or woe. After the
                           wedding they sat
                           down in the rude little parlor to wait for supper. Dr. Throop had ordered the best
                           the house was
                           able to give. The supper was really good; there were nice fresh biscuits, good coffee,
                           roast beef
                           and potatoes, preserved fruits, and many dainties which our wedding party had been
                           deprived of for a
                           few days past.

                        <p id="d196929e4023">Adelaide was too happy and too much excited to eat much: but Dr. Throop, Horace and
                           Dick ate
                           heartily. They again repaired to the parlor. Dr. Throop had ordered a room for himself
                           and bride on
                           the second floor. The hotel parlor was somewhat crowded. The whole theme of conversation
                           was the
                           late storm that had swept over the plains and destroyed so much life and property.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4026">The doctor knew Adelaide was too ill to listen to much about the sufferings of others,
                           so he tenderly
                           inquired if she would 
                           <hi id="d196929e4028" style="font-style: italic;">not</hi> rather retire to her own room, which she readily did,
                           with greatful feelings for so much kindness on his part. He called an attendant to
                           lead the way to
                           the room, and he also accompanied his bride to the threshold of their chamber. It
                           was a small room,
                           with whitewashed walls, two windows with white curtains, and a rag carpet on the floor;
                           a neat bed,
                           dressed in white, a wash-stand and towels, and a couple of chairs completed the outfit.
                           But this was
                           a great improvement to what Adelaide's sleeping apartment had been for the past few
                           nights.

                        <p id="d196929e4032">Dr. Throop apologized, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4034" who="#fthroop">"My Darling, I am sorry I <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="132"> </a></span> can not afford you better rooms, but this is really the best we can
                              do at the present."

                        <p id="d196929e4039">She thanked him, saying pleasantly, 
                           <said id="d196929e4041" who="#astuart">"Do not be disturbed on my account,
                              doctor.
                           </said> (She had learned to call him doctor in their few day's acquaintance.)
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4045">He fondly assured her he would provide better room, and kissing her blushing cheeks
                           and ruby lips,
                           with a fond husband's right, he left her alone to the rest she so much needed. When
                           he had gone, a
                           waiting girl made her appearance and asked if there was anything she could do for
                           her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4048">Adelaide thought of her dilapidated wardrobe, her soiled linen, and asked her if she
                           could purchase
                           ready-made underwear in the place, adding that she was willing to pay any price. The
                           girl was a
                           bright, intelligent girl, who readily understood Adelaide's situation, and replied
                           there was not any
                           ready-made clothing for ladies at the store, but she could loan the lady a nice suit
                           if she would
                           accept them. Adelaide disliked to borrow, but seeing this was her only chance, she
                           accepted the
                           offer. She ordered fresh water, took a bath, laid aside the soiled linen and arrayed
                           herself in the
                           fresh, clean clothes of the obliging girl, and felt much better. She sent her linen
                           to the wash and
                           asked the girl to have her black cashmere well aired and dusted, as she could not
                           replenish her
                           wardrobe until they went to a larger place. When she was dressed in the clean, white
                           muslin night
                           robe, she seated herself in a low rocking chair near the window and gave herself up
                           to happy
                           thoughts. She was indeed a happy bride. True, it had not yet been a week since she
                           had met Dr.
                           Throop, but she felt in the few days she had known him that he was the only man on
                           earth she could
                           love. She sat thinking sweet thoughts of her young husband, of his kind and tender
                           love. She
                           resolved he should never regret his hasty <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="138" data-tei-n="133"> </a></span> choice of a wife,
                           saying to herself,

                        <p id="d196929e4056">While she sat musing in the twilight the girl returned, bringing a lighted kerosene
                           lamp, which she
                           placed upon the stand and lay beside it a roll of fresh newspapers, and kindly inquired
                           if there was
                           anything more she could do.

                        <p id="d196929e4062">The girl retired, leaving her alone. She picked up the newspaper and glancing down
                           the columns read,

                        <p id="d196929e4079">Poor Adelaide! her only brother shot dead, with no near friend to care for him in
                           his last hour, and
                           the awful news to meet her eves on her bridal evening. The exposure she had undergone
                           for the past
                           few days; the excitement of the last few hours, and now this terrible news, was all
                           too much for her
                           weakened state. She sank back fainting, with the paper grasped in her hand. The doctor
                           entered the
                           room almost immediately. He had grown tired of the company in the parlor and longed
                           to be with his
                           bride. He sought their room, and as he entered the door he saw her sink, fainting
                           to the floor. He
                           ran to her, lifted her up, and cried out, 
                           <said id="d196929e4081" who="#fthroop">"Adelaide, my darling, what is
                              it!"
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="139" data-tei-n="134"> </a></span>
                        
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4087">Her white lips gave no utterance; her black eyes grew dim, and the beautiful face
                           was wan and deathly
                           in its appearance. He kissed her cold face, and clasped her to his breast, a great
                           grief coming to
                           his heart. He feared she would die from the effects of the exposure in the storm.
                           He knew she had
                           been seriously injured, and had borne her suffering with a great amount of patience.
                           He did not
                           think she had seen anything in the paper to cause her to faint.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4090">When she was restored, he carried her to the bed and sat beside her, holding her hands.
                           He tenderly
                           inquired, 
                           <said id="d196929e4092" who="#fthroop">"What is it, darling? Is the pain in your back worse?"</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4095">Here was a chance for an excuse for her, and she replied, that the pain was not so
                           bad now. He
                           soothed her, and bade her rest, and sat beside her, anxious and concerned, while she
                           longed for him
                           to leave, so she could weep for her unfortunate brother. She did not want to mar the
                           pleasure of her
                           wedding day by telling him he had married the sister of a murderer, and the name she
                           gave for his
                           was covered with disgrace. But she longed so earnestly for the privacy of her own
                           room where she
                           could mourn undisturbed for her brother.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4098">Dr. Throop saw she was agitated, and seemed to be grieved. He whispered softly, 
                           <said id="d196929e4100" who="#fthroop">"You are not sorry we are married, Adelaide?"</said> His kindness was too much for her
                           overburdened heart. She burst into a violent fit of weeping, and fairly shook the
                           bed with her heavy
                           sobbing.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4104">Dr. Throop was distressed beyond all comparison; his knowledge of woman was very limited.
                           He knew
                           they were hysterical at times, but he could not understand why Adelaide should feel
                           so terrible bad
                           on their wedding day. She ceased weeping, but heavy sobs came from her lips at intervals,
                           and when
                           she sank to sleep, her husband sat at her bedside with watchful care. He felt her
                           pulse, but could
                           not detect <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="140" data-tei-n="135"> </a></span> any symptoms of fever. Her suffering seemed to be more
                           of a mental nature. Then he began to pity her; he thought perhaps he had urged her
                           to a marriage
                           that was distasteful to her. He resolved not to impose his love upon her if she seemed
                           to avoid him,
                           but it was bitterness to a nature like his to think, perhaps, he had acted prematurely
                           in urging his
                           love upon her, and binding her to him in marriage within a week from the time he first
                           met her. He
                           said to himself, 
                           <said id="d196929e4108" who="#fthroop">"Poor child, she was all alone, with no female friends to care
                              for her, on her wedding night; I will not intrude my love on her. I will be her friend,
                              her
                              physician and wait until she wants me for her husband."
                           </said> He said, passionately, in an
                           undertone, 
                           <said id="d196929e4111" who="#fthroop">"I will win you, my beautiful darling, and you will come to my arms
                              of your own free will."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4114">While he sat thinking, his eye unconsciously fell upon the paper she had been reading
                           when she
                           fainted. He picked it up and read the very lines she had read, "
                           <hi id="d196929e4116" style="font-style: italic;">Accidentally shot.
                              Lieutenant John Hobbs
                           </hi>," etc. Some way these lines possessed an attraction for him. He
                           folded up the paper and placed it in the breast pocket of his coat. He sat thinking,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4119" who="fthroop">"this Hobbs may have been her lover, and the news of his death may have caused her
                              fainting spell."
                           </said> Then he solilloquized like unto this : 
                           <said id="d196929e4122" who="#fthroop">"I will be
                              careful of her, and when she is well I will remark something about this Hobbs' death
                              and watch
                              her closely. Her tell-tale face will own the truth to me."
                           </said> Then his great heart grew to
                           pitying her, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4125" who="#fthroop">"Poor girl! What a shock his death must have been to her.
                              I will be very kind and not mention it, and if she wishes to tell me anything I will
                              listen to
                              her, but I will not allow a jealous thought in my heart of that pure angel. Her face
                              is so
                              sweet. so pure, no wrong ever found room to rest in her pure soul."
                           </said> Toward morning
                           Adelaide slept soundly, sometimes a long, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="141" data-tei-n="136"> </a></span> shuddering sigh crept
                           up from her breast and died away on her lips.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4132">Dr. Throop never closed his eyes during the long night, and when the first rays of
                           the morning sun
                           gleamed in the east Adelaide opened her eyes and beheld him sitting at her bedside,
                           patient and
                           faithful. When the remembrance of her last night's sorrow came over her, and the thought
                           of her
                           selfish grief passed through her mind, her heart smote her for allowing him to sit
                           there all night.
                           He bent over her tenderly, asked her if there was anything he could do for her, and
                           if she were
                           better.

                        <p id="d196929e4151">He replied,

                        <p id="d196929e4165">The doctors' heart thrilled with tenderness for this lovely woman and a new joy filled
                           his being when
                           he knew her grief of the night before was not caused by aversion to him. He kissed
                           her, and said
                           kindly,

                        <p id="d196929e4170">The first bell now rang for breakfast. The doctor bathed his face, brushed the light
                           brown curls from
                           his broad brow, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="142" data-tei-n="137"> </a></span> and descended to the parlor. Adelaide arose,
                           brushed out her long black curls, wound them into a beautiful coil at the back of
                           her shapely head,
                           donned her black cashmere, and to her husband's surprise, soon joined him and Clifford
                           in the
                           parlor. There were dark shadows 'neath the eyes that told of heavy suffering, but
                           she had determined
                           to bear her grief in silence. She greeted Horace kindly. Dr. Throop led her to a seat,
                           and any one
                           looking at the newly married pair would not have thought the bride had spent the past
                           night in deep
                           sorrow, and the young husband had sat at her bedside all night without a moment's
                           sleep, wrapped in
                           gloomy meditation. But such was the case; they were man and wife by lawful marriage,
                           yet they were
                           separated by some unexpressed feeling.

                        <p id="d196929e4175">Breakfast was announced, and the three sat down at the table together. They had a
                           nice breakfast of
                           good beefsteak, fresh eggs, light biscuit and preserved fruits. After they had eaten,
                           they returned
                           to the parlor to lay plans for the future. Horace Clifford resolved to go on to Leadville
                           in search
                           of the face which so strongly resembled Austria. Dr. Throop thought it quite likely
                           that George Kent
                           had drifted toward Leadville with the tide of emigration going thither. Adelaide was
                           willing to
                           accompany her husband wherever he went, and signified her consent to his plans, saying
                           she was 
                           <said id="d196929e4177" who="#astuart">"content to go wherever he went."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4180">They made arrangements to take the noon train to Denver, Colorado. The doctor had
                           plenty of money,
                           and he resolved to have Adelaide replenish her wardrobe at Denver, and to spend a
                           few days of their
                           newly wedded lives in the great metropolis of the west. He decided to insert advertisements
                           in all
                           the leading western papers, making inquiries <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="143" data-tei-n="138"> </a></span> for the George Kent
                           who came west with the party of boys sent out by Mr. Whitelaw Reid.

                        <p id="d196929e4185">Horace thought he would advertise for Joe Clifford, but was determined to seek him
                           personally. He
                           thought perhaps he might find him in all that vast throng, and while we leave our
                           party en route for
                           Denver, we will take a bird's-eye view of Austria and Mary in the crowded tenement

                        <p id="d196929e4237">It was indeed a dreary time to Austria. Mary had fallen ill and had grown thinner
                           and paler as the
                           days went by. Austria toiled early and late to support them, and many times she went
                           hungry, to
                           provide luxuries for Mary. The doctor said she must have wine and oranges. The weather
                           was warm now;
                           they did not need lire, but everything costs money in the city of New York, and its
                           humble, toiling
                           thousands are often poorly paid. Austria was at work on a book she hoped to have published
                           sometime.
                           But, oh, what a weary time she must wait before she could hope to have it bring her
                           anything! Her
                           limbs ached; her head grew dizzy, and her hands trembled with weakness. Sometimes
                           she almost felt
                           tempted to go to the wealthy banker and stockholder, Mr. Parke, and ask him to loan
                           her a few
                           dollars to provide for Mary's wants while she lay sick. She knew Mary's pride <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="145" data-tei-n="140"> </a></span> would revolt at such a step, and she would rather die than accept a favor
                           from one whose offers of kindness she had rejected. Austria reasoned like this: 
                           <said id="d196929e4241" who="#abclifford">"Was it really harm for Mary to accept help from Mr. Parke. He was lapped in
                              luxury; everything that heart could desire or wealth procure was lavished at his feet,
                              while the
                              woman he loved lay suffering for the actual necessities of life."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4244">On the day of which I write, Mary had suffered violent pain during a greater part
                           of the night
                           previous. Austria had been kind and patient in her attendance; their little stock
                           of household
                           furniture had been parted with, piece by piece, until the one little room in the third
                           floor of the
                           tenement house was almost bare. They had one poor-looking little bed, but it was white
                           and clean.
                           The cheap white spread that covered the bed was not whiter than Mary's patient face.
                           There was one
                           little cracked stove where they broiled steak and made tea, when they could afford
                           such luxuries. It
                           had been almost a week since Austria had tasted meat or tea. Mary craved ice and cooling
                           drinks, and
                           her earnings had all been spent to procure these. Mary had been too sick to notice
                           that Austria was
                           starving. To-day she was better, and Austria was going to carry home the work, and
                           try and get some
                           food for herself. Mary called her to her bedside, and taking her hand in her pale,
                           thin hands, said,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4246" who="mgrey">"Austria, dear, I have suffered until I feel there must be a change; I can not
                              tell how it will be, but whatever comes I feel I am prepared for it."
                           </said> The burning tears
                           crept down Austria's pale cheeks as she sobbed, 
                           <said id="d196929e4249" who="abclifford">"Oh, Mary, Mary, do not talk
                              so. You are my only earthly friend; you are the one pure light that shines over my
                              dark life.
                              Without your kind heart and noble example I feel that I should be utterly cast down.
                              Do not talk
                              of change, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="146" data-tei-n="141"> </a></span> unless it be to health and strength. I can not
                              bear to think of giving yon up, even when I know for you it would be peace eternal;
                              but, oh, my
                              selfish heart cries out and longs for you to be with me yet a while longer in this
                              earthly
                              habitation."

                        <p id="d196929e4255">She spoke cheerfully now: 
                           <said id="d196929e4257" who="abclifford">"Do not get out of heart, Mary; I can work for us
                              both; I know the prospect is gloomy now, and the streets of New York are thronged
                              with its
                              suffering hundreds. Tired, worthless-looking men, haggard, sad-eyed women, eager,
                              pinched,
                              little, hungry-faced children, greet my eyes in every direction. There is nothing
                              but poisoned
                              air, suffering and distress on every side. Poor Jane Hall lost two of her little ones
                              yesterday
                              with scarlet fever. I could not weep for them, they are gone to a better world, a
                              land where
                              sorrow never comes and peace reigns for evermore."

                        <p id="d196929e4260">Mary clasped Austria's hand in hers and said,

                        <p id="d196929e4302">She trusted Him who was strong to redeem and able to save to the uttermost. In the
                           darkest hour of
                           her suffering and misfortune, she felt the strong arm of a merciful Savior thrown
                           around her, and
                           realized that she had chosen the wiser part, and built her house upon the rock of
                           true faith, Christ
                           Jesus. And though storms of sorrow should come, and dark tempests of grief and sadness
                           o'erwhelm her
                           for a while, she felt that that 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"peace which passeth understanding"</quote> would yet be
                           hers.

                        <p id="d196929e4308">Austria arose from that bedside, comforted and strengthened. She went out in the streets
                           of New York,
                           and the motly crowd that greeted her eyes assumed a new appearance to her. They were
                           God-created
                           human beings, and He had some wise plan in creating them. She understood that many
                           of the seemingly
                           poor and starving ones were happy in their way. When their simple wants were supplied
                           they did not
                           possess an aching heart such as she did. The words came into her mind, 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"That the burden is
                              fitted to the back,"
                           </quote> and every one of these creatures were born to till their destined
                           graves, and each would live out its frail life here and go home to rest. The promise
                           of that rest
                           gave resignation to her tired spirit, the thought that she was one day nearer home,
                           one day nearer
                           the peace eternal, calmed her troubled mind. And she resolved to bear her life with
                           resignation, if
                           not with happiness. The words drifted through her mind, 
                           <quote style=" display: inline; ">"The Lord loveth whom he
                              chasteneth,"
                           </quote> and then she wondered why it was a spirit must be made tired of this earth
                           before it could long for the life beyond this. A longing came to her heart to see
                           Horace once more.
                           She had received a letter from Joe on his arrival in Kansas saying he had found employment
                           with Mr.
                           Brown, stating also that he expected to go to Leadville. She thought of her beautiful,
                           sunny-faced
                           boy, and <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="148" data-tei-n="143"> </a></span> longed to clasp him to her heart. A silent prayer went
                           up from her heart, 
                           <said id="d196929e4318" who="#abclifford">"Lord bless and keep Joe."</said> A mother's prayer, pure
                           and white-winged, it entered the pearly gates of heaven and found an echo in the great
                           throbbing
                           heart of the master mind of the universe. She pursued her way to the shop. When she
                           came to a
                           crossing she was weak and faint from long fasting. Her walk had exhausted what little
                           strength she
                           had, and she sank fainting on the street. A splendid pair of high-stepping jet black
                           horses and a
                           carriage stopped at her side; a noble looking grey-haired man sprang from the carriage
                           and lifted
                           the fainting woman in his arms. The gentleman was Mr. Parke; his noble, generous heart
                           had been
                           touched with sympathy for the beautiful wan face. He left his horses in the care of
                           a groom and bore
                           her to a drug store near by, where she soon recovered. He urged her to drink a glass
                           of wine, which
                           in a measure restored her failing strength. He then kindly inquired where she lived,
                           saying he would
                           take her home in his carriage.

                        <p id="d196929e4323">She remembered her work and started up eagerly, saying,

                           woe, that went
                           straight to the heart of Mr. Parke.

                           words of this
                           noble man, and a tide of bitterness welled over her heart against Horace Clifford,
                           when she
                           remembered he had caused her to live in such destitution— <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="149" data-tei-n="144"> </a></span> an
                           object of charity to a stranger. She put back the falling tears, and accepted his

                           home.

                        <p id="d196929e4341">It did not take long for the proud stepping blacks to bring them to the miserable
                           tenement house. He
                           assisted her up the stairs, for her steps were weak and tottering. The door of their
                           room had been
                           left ajar to let in the fresh summer air, and Mary lay quietly sleeping—a smile of
                           peace on her
                           lovely face. One glance at her face sent a pang, sharp and swift, to the heart of
                           Mr. Parke. Here
                           was the woman, among women, he had loved, with her pure, sinless heart and heavenly
                           face, beautitied
                           by patience and suffering. He started back at sight of her; he was tilled with joy
                           at finding her;
                           for many long years he had been seeking her. He had been a widower several years;
                           his wife had worn
                           herself out in a round of fashionable folly, and now slept her last long sleep. He
                           had sought far
                           and wide for sweet Mary Grey. The cottage home where first he met her had passed into
                           stranger
                           hands, and he could find no trace of her. He was wealthy, but his wealth brought no
                           pleasure to him,
                           save the pleasure of making others happy. He was known as one of the most liberal
                           benefactors among
                           men. His name headed many benevolent societies; he gave freely of his vast wealth,
                           but no rest came
                           to his anxious heart, no peace to his weary soul. The one unsatisfied longing of his
                           heart kept
                           repeating evermore, 
                           <said id="d196929e4343" who="#hparke">"Lost! lost! Mary Grey."</said> And now when age had
                           whitened his locks and sixty years had told their numbers over him, he had found her;
                           and she seemed
                           to be dying. He took one step into the little bare room, and sank upon a wooden stool
                           standing near
                           her bed. He bowed his stately head upon his hands, and hot tears trickled down the
                           cheeks, burrowed
                           with age.

                           light, the thought entered her mind, this was the man of whom Mary had spoken; the
                           very man she
                           herself had almost determined to seek out and tell of Mary's painful situation. And
                           now he was, by
                           some strange providence, here in the room with them.

                        <p id="d196929e4353">Mary opened her eyes and they rested on the bowed head of Mr. Parke. Just then he
                           raised his head;

                              dying; the very air is foul with deathly odors."

                              life of poverty to a life of dishonor. I have no earthly ties—little Ethel is dead.
                              My friend,
                              Austria Clifford, has cared for me in poverty and ill health, and if you are willing
                              to take her
                              with us I will be your wife."

                              Parkhurst is lonely, but we will soon make it ring with music, and be glad with happy
                              hearts.
                              But you are so faint and weak, you must have some nourishment and be prepared for
                              our wedding
                              this evening. I can not bear the thought of being separated from you, now I have found
                              you."

                        <p id="d196929e4417">He pressed a well-filled purse into the hand of Mary, saying,

                              will need something to fit you out for our wedding, which will take place this evening

                           </said> He pressed a kiss upon her brow, almost crushed Austria's hand at parting, and
                           said,

                        <p id="d196929e4425">He descended the rickety stairs, entered his carriage, drove to a restaurant, ordered
                           a well filled
                           basket sent to Austria and Mary's room and then gave orders to be driven to the city
                           park. The
                           proud, high-stepping horses, elegant carriage and stately old gentleman attracted
                           much attention
                           even in Gotham. There were many stylish ladies bowed and smiled to the gray haired
                           occupant of that
                           carriage, for notwithstanding his silver hair and many years there were many young
                           ladies who would
                           willingly have married him for the sake of his wealth and elegant home. Beside owning
                           Parkhurst, one

                           city. He owned vast railroad stock and countless other kinds of wealth. He was considered
                           by
                           maneuvering mammas and match-making aunts as one of the most eligible matches in the
                           city. But
                           little he cared for all that. He had found the woman he had loved for years and sought
                           so earnestly.
                           But how had he found her! He feared she was dying of want. And while he was driven
                           around that
                           beautiful carriage-way in the city park his heart ached with undefined sadness.

                        <p id="d196929e4430">The trees were gently waving in the breeze; birds were singing, flowers blooming and
                           the sun shining
                           down in glad brightness, while he thought his loved one lay dying. He had suddenly
                           grown sad
                           hearted; he feared he had found her too late. But his sadness was short-lived; he
                           talked to himself
                           saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4432" who="#hparke">"Sweet Mary Gray, you must live to solace my declining years. I shall be
                              so tender with you; it will be my heart's delight to lavish wealth on you, deck you
                              in costly
                              robes and see your sweet face glow with untold pleasure."
                           </said> With these happy thoughts in
                           his heart he returned to Parkhurst, called Jarvis, the middle-aged housekeeper, into
                           his room, and
                           gave orders for an elegant supper to be served at ten that evening, also to have two
                           suites of rooms
                           made ready for guests. The aged lover then made such arrangements as he deemed necessary
                           for his
                           wedding, and then lay down to rest awhile until lunch time.

                        <p id="d196929e4436">His nephew and heir expectant, Charlie Parke, lived with his uncle. He was a tall,
                           shambling young
                           man, about twenty years of age, with tow colored hair and yellowish green eyes. He
                           was too indolent
                           to be really bad. He had been raised and educated by his uncle, and had lived in anticipation
                           of the
                           day inheriting his uncle's vast wealth, which his uncle had decided he should not,
                           saying to
                           himself, 
                           <said id="d196929e4438" who="#hparke">"I will endow a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="153" data-tei-n="148"> </a></span> charitable
                              institution with my money, rather than know it will be wasted by such a milksop as
                              Charlie."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4443">Mr. Parke tolerated Charlie, because he was his brother's son, and his only near living
                           relative; but
                           the selfish, unprincipled character Charlie displayed was very distasteful to the
                           high notions of
                           honor possessed by the elder Mr. Parke. When they met at lunch that day, Mr. Parke
                           informed his
                           nephew that he would be married that evening at seven o'clock, and would expect his
                           nephew to be at
                           home at supper at ten o'clock. Charlie elevated his eyebrows and asked who the fortunate
                           lady might
                           be that was to be honored as his uncle's bride.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4446">Mr. Parke remarked, that she was a lady with whom he had been acquainted for many
                           years, and one in
                           every way worthy to fill the position she was going to occupy. He said the old home
                           was lonely and
                           he had decided to bring a wife there to brighten things up a little, as he termed
                           it. He was
                           tender-hearted, and he did not wish Charlie to feel badly; so he said, 
                           <said id="d196929e4448" who="#hparke">"It need
                              make no difference to you, Charlie; your life here will be the same."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4452">Charlie knew it would be useless to raise objections, or remonstrate. When once his
                           uncle had made
                           his mind up on a thing it was as decided as the law of the Medes and Persians. Therefore,
                           he
                           submitted with the best grace he could, concealing his disappointment from his uncle,
                           but nursing a
                           secret hatred for his uncle's wife, and determined to make her life miserable if he
                           could.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4455">The day sped rapidly by, and the hour for the bridal drew near. Austria had made good
                           use of her
                           time. In a city you can procure fine articles of ready-made wearing apparel; therefore,
                           as soon as
                           she had prepared some food for them she went to work to prepare Mary for her wedding
                           from the well
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="154" data-tei-n="149"> </a></span> filled purse of her generous old lover. She bought a
                           beautiful ashes-of-roses silk for Mary's wedding dress, white flowers, laces, ribbons
                           and gloves to
                           match with the dress, but she bought nothing for herself. Mary remonstrated, saying
                           she would refuse
                           Mr. Parke right at the altar if Austria would not go with her to her new home.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4460">Austria argued that Mr. Parke only asked her through politeness, and she did not think
                           it was right
                           to accept his invitation or use any of the money he had given Mary to procure her
                           wardrobe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4463">Mary, like most gentle dispositioned people, when she took a notion, was very positive
                           on a subject.
                           She said, Mr. Parke would feel hurt and offended if Austria refused to accompany her
                           home, and she
                           felt sure he meant the purse for both of them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4466">Finally Austria decided to purchase a cheap black alpaca dress, ready-made. She did
                           not wish to
                           grieve Mary in her present weak state of health, and thought she would go home with
                           her and stay
                           until she was fully recovered and then return again to her old life in the tenement
                           house and live
                           out the years of her dreary life in loneliness and waiting. When the hour approached
                           for the wedding
                           Mr. Parke's carriage drew up in the street fronting the tenement, and he descended
                           from it with a
                           minister, who was to celebrate the solemn nuptials. They ascended the rickety stairs,
                           and there, in
                           that little bare room in a tenement house, the marriage service was read over them.
                           The New York
                           millionaire and the homeless woman he loved and honored as his wife were made one
                           in the sight of
                           God and man forever. The tears sprang to Austria's eyes at the memory of her own ill-fated
                           marriage.
                           She soon dashed the tears from her eyes and recovered her composure as speedily as
                           possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="155" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span>
                        
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4472">When the marriage ceremony was completed Mr. Parke tenderly wrapped a shawl about
                           the shouders of his
                           wife, and bore her to the carriage, bidding Austria come on, and bid farewell to the
                           tenement house
                           forever. They were soon at Parkhurst, where Mr. Parke seated Mary in a large easy
                           chair in the grand
                           parlor, and bade her welcome to her future home. Jarvis had prepared an elegant supper,
                           which was
                           scarcely tasted. Charlie Parke, Austria and the officiating minister were the only
                           guests at the
                           wedding supper.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4475">The dark clouds were drawn aside from Mary's life. Henceforth she had only to live
                           and enjoy the
                           peace and comfort of her surroundings. Mr. Parke and Mary would not consent to Austria's
                           return to
                           her humble home, but prevailed upon her to accept a suite of rooms in their elegant
                           and roomy home,
                           and pursue her literary labors. Mr. Parke had read several of her small poems in some
                           of the popular
                           magazines and felt that she only needed time and application to become a successful
                           authoress. This
                           she resolved to do, and then she felt she could repay in money what they had advanced
                           to her.

                        <p id="d196929e4519"> Morning dawned bright and fair o'er the mountain home of Clement Howe. Trees sparkled
                           with dew drops
                           as the sun rose higher on his daily course. George awoke with a start; he had slept
                           soundly, and now
                           awoke refreshed. For years he had craved a home where he might live apart from mankind
                           and find
                           rest. Only those who have been deprived of the privileges of a quiet home can understand
                           his weary
                           longing for quietness and peace. He arose, dressed himself and prepared to descend
                           to the drawing
                           room. Uncle Abel and Aunt Hope had long since roused Silas, Marinda and John from
                           their slumbers,
                           and had them busily employed about their duties. Clement slept soundly and awoke early
                           in the
                           morning. He sat in the beautiful morning parlor which had been thoroughly warmed by
                           bright, open
                           fires in the grates, made of coal and blazing pine knots. He was thinking of his dreary
                           and isolated
                           life; of the woman who long ago had wrecked his happiness―as he thought of this an
                           involuntary sigh
                           arose to his lips. Just at this time George <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="157" data-tei-n="152"> </a></span> Kent entered the
                           spacious dining room and stood near the grate. Clement saw him through the open doors.
                           George
                           glanced around the elegantly furnished room; his eyes wandered over the costly china
                           and silver that
                           decked the table; lingered for a moment on the pictures that adorned the walls; then
                           rested on the
                           fire with a troubled look in their sombre depths. How could he, the New York boot
                           black, live in
                           this gentleman's house and deceive him about his sex. (We still speak of George as
                           a boy). He felt
                           the kindness and generosity of Clement Howe had prompted him to offer him a home;
                           he had accepted
                           it, at the time, but he had not considered what his kind benefactor might require
                           of him. Here a
                           thought of the horses crossed his mind, and he shuddered when he thought of them.
                           Clement expected
                           him to ride one of those vicious brutes, and he feared he could not. With a mighty
                           effort he
                           repressed the thought, and determined, if human will and endurance could accomplish
                           all Clement Howe
                           required of him, he would accomplish it or perish in the attempt. A new light shown
                           in the dusky
                           eyes, and a glad feeling crept into his heart while he thought he would do this for
                           Mr. Howe. There
                           was a fascination, a power, in Clement's wish to George. He felt when Mr. Howe desired
                           him to do a
                           thing he would attempt it with a determination to succeed, and only acknowledge he
                           could not
                           accomplish it when he had failed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4524">Clement, unobserved by George, had been watching him closely. He said to himself:
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4526" who="#chowe">"What a beautiful boy, and how determined and resolute he is. I only wish he was stronger.
                              If
                              it had not been for him, I would have been sleeping my last sleep long ago. I must
                              try and make
                              a good, smart man of him. Poor little fellow! He looks so delicate; he looks almost
                              like a girl,
                              with his tender mouth <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="158" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span> and patient eyes. His life has been so
                              hard; he has never known anything but hardship and privation; he shall never know
                              want again
                              while I live."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4532">With thoughts like these, he arose and entered the dining room, saying pleasantly
                           to George,
                           <said id="d196929e4534" who="#chowe"> "How are you feeling this morning?"</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4537">
                           <said id="d196929e4538" who="#gkent">"Much better, thank you,"</said> George replied, while a crimson flush mounted his
                           pale face.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4542">Clement saw the pale cheek grow red and the beautiful eyes grow humid when he spoke
                           to the boy, but
                           he attributed it to his not being accustomed to good society or the friendly inquiries
                           of any one.
                           He said kindly: 
                           <said id="d196929e4544" who="#chowe">"I hope you will recover in a few days; I shall look after some
                              affairs at home to-day. There is the library; you can amuse yourself looking through
                              the books;
                              you will doubtless find something to interest you. This evening I will give you some
                              instruction
                              in music."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4547">This pleased George; here was a respite of one day that he was free from riding one
                           of those terrible
                           horses. His face immediately grew brighter, and when John entered with the breakfast―fresh
                           venison
                           steaks, steaming hot, on chafing dishes, fragrant coffee and light rolls of delicious
                           homemade
                           bread―George ate heartily. Clement was pleased to see him eat, and kept urging him
                           to partake of the
                           viands placed before him. When they had finished breakfast and returned to the parlor,
                           Clement
                           showed George the library and bade him make himself at home. He then went out to inspect
                           his stables
                           and look after his horses.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4550">George, left alone, searched over the library; found a volume of Tennyson's poems,
                           and sat basking in
                           the morning sunlight, dreaming sweet dreams. Here was the one place on earth he craved―a
                           quiet,
                           peaceful home, with plenty of <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="159" data-tei-n="154"> </a></span> books, and no one to molest or
                           disturb him. He could roam at will through this spacious house, and view the beauties
                           of the
                           landscape in every direction; or he could sit for hours, lost to the busy outside
                           world, wrapped in
                           his own thoughts, and happy in solitude. This home was all his highest imagination
                           had ever dreamed
                           of; to him it was sweet as a poet's―as an Eden bower fair. It was the shore of peace
                           and rest, after
                           the long, tempestuous voyage of trial. George had never, since the first hour of his
                           remembrance,
                           had a day wholly his own, where he could sit alone in peace and quiet, undisturbed,
                           and rest. This
                           day he would make good use of. Many a day, through storm and tempest, his heart had
                           craved a day of
                           rest like this. Now he was anchored near the peaceful shore, and his soul could bask
                           and revel in
                           the light of his loved one's eyes. Here his life could grow stronger and better, his
                           mind higher and
                           purer. The clear, bracing air, the lofty mountains, the grand display of nature's
                           magnificent works,
                           all possessed a power to elevate and ennoble the human mind. Life seemed to him just
                           opening in the
                           delightful pleasure of living. The miserable existence in New York of skimping and
                           toiling for his
                           daily bread was fast fading away from his mind like a troubled dream. He longed to
                           forget that he
                           had ever lived there; he wanted that wretched part of his existence to pass into utter
                           oblivion, and
                           be remembered no more forever; his mind was busy with thoughts of the past and hopes
                           for the future.
                           He determined to study hard and fit himself for an honorable place in life; he could
                           not help the
                           channel into which his fate had driven him; he could not help it because he had been
                           cast upon the
                           world in a false position; his sex was a secret in his own heart, and he resolved
                           to keep it buried
                           deep and dark as the hidden treasures of <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="160" data-tei-n="155"> </a></span> the earth. What mattered
                           it to Clement Howe, be he girl or boy, so he never knew the difference?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4557">Here a hot blush of shame mounted his face when he thought how Clement would despise
                           him when he knew
                           how, for years, he had practiced a systematic course of deception― passing himself
                           for a boy, while
                           he was in reality that object held in so much contempt by Clement Howe, a 
                           <hi id="d196929e4559" style="font-style: italic;">girl</hi>! He
                           longed to throw himself at Clement's feet and acknowledge all, but the fear that Clement
                           would send
                           him away restrained him. He knew, as a girl, he could not live alone in the mountain
                           home of Clement
                           Howe, but as a boy he could remain undisturbed. Fate still drove him onward in a course
                           from which
                           he saw no loop-hole of escape.

                        <p id="d196929e4564">The morning soon sped away, in reading and thinking; at half-past two they had dinner.
                           Here again he
                           met Clement. The dinner passed off pleasantly; after which Mr. Howe again went out
                           on the farm to
                           look after some work he was having done, saying as he went out, 
                           <said id="d196929e4566" who="#chowe">"Do not be lonely
                              George, I will give you a lesson in music this evening."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4569">George bowed and smiled his thanks, saying, he would be glad to take a lesson when
                           Mr. Howe could
                           spare the time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4572">Evening came, and with it the promised lesson. It was like a paradise on earth to
                           George; it was the
                           happiest hour he had ever experienced in his life. The soft, sweet notes of melody,
                           thrilling and
                           tender, sank deep into George's heart, and awoke a long slumbering passion in his
                           soul. The passion
                           for music she had inherited from her father and his music-loving race. That evening
                           a new love was
                           born in the heart of George―a love for music, and a sort of wild, deep soul-worship
                           for his teacher.
                           All thought of an explanation faded from the mind of George, and he resolved never
                           to divulge the
                           secret of his sex; but to live and act as a boy, so he <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="161" data-tei-n="155"> </a></span> could be
                           near the object of his soul's worship. With these resolutions, he devoted himself
                           earnestly to his
                           lesson.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4577">Clement was surprised at the progress he made, and praised his musical talent, saying,
                           "George, it is
                           a pleasure to me to instruct you; you show such decided ability to master all the
                           difficult parts of
                           music."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4580">George was happy as a bird, and did not grow tired of the rudiments of music, even
                           of the dullest
                           part. When the lesson had been completed, Clement played some pieces from the old
                           masters with a
                           touch and skill hard to excel.

                        <p id="d196929e4583">George listened, and his soul was raised from thoughts of this life and dwelt on the
                           far away land of
                           rest. Unconsciously the tears crept down his cheeks, and a sigh of happiness welled
                           up from his
                           heart.

                        <p id="d196929e4587">Clement turned and caught that beautiful, rapt expression in the soul-lit eyes of
                           the boy; and he
                           played on—deep-thinking and soul-stirring melodies.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4590">A low sob arose to George's lips, and he dashed the tears from his eyes.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4593">Clement turned round on the piano stool, and reaching out his shapely white hand,
                           drew George to his
                           side and asked him tenderly,

                        <p id="d196929e4598">George replied, with a little fluttering sigh of gladness,

                              as the
                              balance of her treacherous sex. During my early years, I was a kind of waif on the
                              sea of life;
                              I had money, but money can not purchase human love. I knew but little of women; I

                              Helen R―― and was so badly betrayed by one whom I thought pure as an angel that I
                              lost my faith
                              in womankind. And from that day to this I have shunned the sex as something too vile
                              to look
                              upon. To tell the truth, I hate women. The mother of all mankind brought woe to the
                              race, by
                              doing that which she was strictly forbidden to do. As a sex they are willful, deceitful
                              and
                              treacherous, and man's bitterest enemy."

                           from gloomy darkness to a pleasant, genial glow; his fierce clasp loosened from the
                           gentle form, and
                           he murmured brokenly, "God bless you, my boy! You have helped to drive the fire from
                           my brain; the

                        <p id="d196929e4654">For years there had been times in Clement's life when he had been driven almost wild
                           with the thought
                           of his betrayal. He had loved Helen R―― with all the ardent affection of a man's first
                           love, and
                           when he awoke to the reality of her treachery, he thought his faith in womankind was
                           wrecked
                           forevermore. Here alone and in solitude for years he had nursed these bitter feelings
                           until he had
                           lost every particle of faith in woman's purity and truth. If he had known the little
                           one he held so
                           close in his embrace and loved with such an unaccountable tenderness had been a girl,
                           in place of a
                           boy, he would have spurned her from his presence. But man's nature craves an object
                           of worship; the
                           tender, soothing influence of woman's love possesses a magnetic power over man's most
                           turbulent
                           passions; her tenderness and sympathy soothes his saddest hours, and shines with bright
                           and steady
                           light amid the gloom and darkness that oftimes surrounds man in his earthly pilgrimage.
                           And when man
                           becomes insensible to the refining influence of woman's love, he is lost to all the
                           higher
                           sentiments of humanity.

                           from the mass of
                           human kind, as some lofty mountain that lifted its barren and desolate top above its
                           neighbor
                           mountains, and pierced the clouds with its lofty peaks, crowned in eternal snow; or
                           stood, like some
                           lone and lifeless tree, that rises amid its brother forest trees stretching out its
                           barren limbs to
                           the moaning winds of winter, and the scorching heats of summer. But as the years go
                           by, one by one,
                           the seeds are scattered on that mountain side, that will clothe it with eternal verdure
                           close to its
                           lofty summit. And one by one, the little tendrils of clinging ivy will twine around
                           the gnarled and
                           twisted trunk, the barren and leafless branches of that mighty monarch of the forest,
                           until its
                           hideous deformity is covered from sight and it presents a lovely appearance to the
                           passer by.

                           must bow to its
                           sublime commands. And true to this man's nature, he was seeking an object of adoration
                           in this boy.
                           He had been subject to the boy's influence but a few days, and yet there seemed to
                           be a subtle
                           influence at work, bending this strong man's nature to the mysterious power of an
                           innocent girl's
                           first love. He was soothed and calmed by the presence of the boy.

                           numerous hair-breadth escapes for the edification of Aunt Hope, Uncle Able and John.

                           mindful of her master's comfort, thought it time to close the house for the night.

                           wished to give.

                           evening's
                           entertainment. The memory of those terrible horses brought sorrow to his heart. A
                           peaceful, quiet
                           home with Clement Howe was all he craved to make him happy, but a life full of adventure
                           and wild
                           rides over the mountain roads was almost more than he could bear to think of in his
                           present weak
                           state of health. Yet the presence of Clement endowed him with a wish to do whatever
                           he willed; and
                           he determined to make the effort to ride if he was killed in the attempt.

                        <p id="d196929e4726">Clement gave George a night-lamp and kindly bade him good night, saying,

                              your rest, dear George; you must take good care of yourself until you are fully recovered;

                              came very near having a serious spell of fever."

                        <p id="d196929e4735">Not so with Clement. The presence of that boy had broken into the daily routine of
                           his life. For the
                           first time in many years he had taken an interest in something beside the inanimate
                           things of
                           nature. He was like a young mother with her first born babe, or a young girl with
                           her first lover.
                           He wanted to be all he could to that child in his loneliness. The conversation with
                           him had opened
                           afresh his heart's deep wounds, and he was restless under the smarting pain. He strode
                           up and down
                           the parlor like some mad creature until long after midnight. His thoughts wandered
                           back to the
                           bygone years when he loved and trusted a fair young girl and believed her pure as
                           an angel, while
                           she was deceiving him all the while. At length, wearied out with distress of mind,
                           he retired to
                           rest, and toward morning sank into a fitful slumber.

                           darkness and
                           mists from the mountain tops. When the inmates of Eagle's Eyrie had breakfasted Clement
                           ordered
                           Wildfire and Fleetfoot to be brought out, as he and George were going to take a ride.

                           blue cap fitted
                           close over his black curls. There was a nervous, wistful look in the delicate face,
                           but the mournful
                           black eyes had a steady light in them that spoke a strong determination in them to
                           ride the horse or
                           perish in the attempt.

                        <p id="d196929e4779">John led Fleetfoot up to the marble mounting-steps; Silas held Wildfire, who was viciously

                           time since the
                           beautiful horses had been brought out, finely caparisoned, for a dashing race down
                           the mountain side
                           and over the plain. Fleetfoot was a beautiful dappled gray, sleek as a mole, with
                           trim-made limbs
                           and long, slender <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="168" data-tei-n="163"> </a></span> body. When John led him to the steps, Clement
                           came himself to assist George to the small, well-fitting saddle. Gently he seated
                           the boy in the
                           saddle and placed the bridle reins in his hands, telling him when he wished to turn
                           to the left to
                           draw the left rein, when to the right to draw the right rein, and when he wished to
                           continue
                           straight along, to draw the reins evenly and seat himself firmly in the saddle, and
                           on all occasions
                           to hold on to the reins, never losing his hold, as that would give the horse an advantage
                           over the
                           rider.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4784">It was well for George that Clement gave him such minute directions, and it was well
                           for himself he
                           heeded them, or that would have been his last ride. When George was mounted, the groom
                           led his horse
                           aside and stood with his hand upon the bridle until Clement had mounted Wildfire and
                           led out saying,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e4786" who="#chowe">"Follow me."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4789">George started down the mountain side at an easy pace. Fleetfoot was the very poetry
                           of motion; he
                           did not feel the weight of the boy, and the light pull on the bridle rein was no more
                           than a
                           feather's weight to him. The gentleness and ease with which the horse started inspired
                           George with
                           fresh courage. His face gradually lost its strained expression, and he began to feel
                           easy on
                           horseback. They had ridden quite a distance and were now in a beautiful road leading
                           down the
                           valley, when the sharp report of a rifle rang out near them, startling both horses
                           and their riders.
                           Quick as lightning's flash Fleetfoot darted away down the road. George clung on to
                           the reins with
                           all his puny strength, but Clement saw he was unable to check the mad brute, as it
                           dashed headlong
                           on its way. He shouted to George, 
                           <said id="d196929e4791" who="#chowe">"Sit firm in the saddle and hold him straight
                              in the road,"
                           </said> while he dug the rowels into his horse's sides and vainly endeavored to
                           overtake them; but Wildfire did not possess the speed that Fleetfoot <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="169" data-tei-n="164"> </a></span> did, and while terror lent speed to the latter, all the urging in the
                           world could not bring the former alongside of the runaway animal. On and on sped the
                           maddened beast;
                           trees, rocks and passing objects seemed to fly on his way. Faster and faster flew
                           the horses' feet,
                           while great flecks of foam dropped from his distended nostrils and flew out on the
                           air. Colder and
                           firmer grew the grasp upon the bridle reins; settled and more fixed the expression
                           in the black
                           eyes. George felt he was on his road to death. A farewell for all on earth flitted
                           through his mind.
                           He thought of his life in New York, and felt he had nothing in that city for which
                           he craved to
                           live. He thought of Joe Clifford, and a silent prayer went up from his heart, "God
                           bless Joe;" he
                           thought of Clement Howe, the man whose life he had saved, and who was now sending
                           him to his death;
                           but he bore no ill-will to his kind friend and benefactor. He knew Clement believed
                           him to be a boy,
                           and wanted him to learn to ride for his own sake.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4797"> They tell us the ruling passion in life is strong in death. With the thought of Clement,
                           came the
                           desire to conceal his sex. He felt that death would perhaps reveal to Clement the
                           fact that he was a
                           girl, and Clement would hate him for his deception after he was dead. With this thought
                           came the
                           desire to live. All these things passed rapidly through his mind in less time than
                           I have been
                           telling it. A gleam of fire shot into the black eyes, and the puny hands pulled on
                           the bridle rein
                           which only added fresh impetus to the flying horse.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4800">Clement had urged Wildfire to the top of his speed, hoping to overtake the runaway,
                           but all in vain.
                           He cursed himself, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4802" who="#chowe">"It is my mad folly in urging the boy to ride, that
                              has brought this about; he saved my life, and I have driven him to his death. Poor
                              boy, I saw
                              his aversion to riding in <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="170" data-tei-n="165"> </a></span> the shrinking eyes and quivering
                              nostrils. But I thought to overcome that, and have him for my constant and steady
                              companion, in
                              my rides through the country. My only hope is, he may be able to sit on the horse
                              until he runs
                              himself down. There,"
                           </said> he exclaimed, as he saw George take a desperate pull at the reins,
                           "God bless the boy, he has the nerve of manhood in him. See how steady he sits his
                           horse, and how
                           firm he grasped the reins, holding him straight to the track."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4808">That grasp on the reins had never been loosed since he had first placed his hands
                           upon them. George
                           had the power of endurance in mind, but his body was too weak for such a trial of
                           strength. He sat
                           steady and composed because he was chained to his seat in terror. When the horse first
                           started he
                           had gained the courage of despair, and resolved to sit in the saddle as long as he
                           could, or until
                           he was dashed to pieces by the terrified beast.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4812">Clement was tortured in his mind, seeing George in such danger, until great drops
                           of sweat beaded out
                           on his brow and dropped off his face. The road led down the valley a distance of fifteen
                           miles and
                           then turned to the west and entered the timbers. At the turn in the road was a deep
                           ravine, thirty
                           feet wide from bank to bank.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4815">Clement kept in sight, and his heart sickened with a terrible dread as he saw the
                           terror-stricken
                           beast rushing on to certain destruction. Nearer and nearer the fatal spot he sped,
                           and Clement
                           closed his eyes to shut out the dreadful sight of that boy riding helplessly on to
                           certain death.
                           The horse was a trained animal and had been taught to jump ravines by the cowboy from
                           whom Clement
                           had bought him. Clement did not know this. He had ridden him several times but Fleetfoot
                           had always
                           appeared docile and tractable, but <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="171" data-tei-n="166"> </a></span> the weight of his master and
                           the strength of his hold on the reins showed him he had some one who could control
                           him. Now he
                           imagined himself to be mounted by the cowboy and felt that he must indulge in a runaway
                           scrape and a
                           few frantic leaps. He had been held to the track on a dead run about sixteen miles,
                           and when he
                           gained the edge of the precipice he gathered himself for a leap and cleared the ravine
                           at a
                           bound.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4820">George sat him like a practiced rider; he had grown used to the motion and bade fair
                           to make a
                           splendid equestrian.

                        <p id="d196929e4823">What was Clement's joy and surprise, when expecting to see horse and rider vanish
                           and lying at the
                           bottom of the ravine, a crushed and quivering mass of dying flesh, in terrible agony,
                           he beheld
                           Fleetfoot moderating his wild run to a gentle canter, and George still erect in the
                           saddle, holding
                           his position with ease and apparently unconcerned about the great feat he had performed
                           in that
                           dangerous leap.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4826">For the first time in many years the hot tears sprang to the eyes of Clement Howe,
                           and he exclaimed
                           fervently, "Thank God for his kindness, and mercy in sparing the dear boy's life."
                           He saw that
                           Fleetfoot had evidently exhausted his desire to run and was now in a very docile condition.
                           He had
                           no further fear in regard to George's ability to control him. He knew any one that
                           could ride a
                           distance of sixteen miles at a dead run, and then leap a ravine thirty feet in width,
                           was in no
                           immediate danger from a horse in a gentle pace, such as Fleetfoot now displayed.

                        <p id="d196929e4829">George made no effort to check the horse; he was determined to give him the full enjoyment
                           of his run
                           now. He had been so badly frightened in the starting out, he felt it would be no more
                           than right to
                           tire him down for his bad conduct, and he would be more submissive in the future.

                        <p id="d196929e4835">Clement advanced at a rapid rate until he overtook George, when he spoke with much
                           kind concern in
                           his voice, asking if George was frightened.

                        <p id="d196929e4838">George replied, "I was very much frightened when the horse began to run, and after
                           he ran awhile I
                           feared he would dash me to pieces in some place; but he did not kill me; I am still
                           spared for some
                           reason."

                        <p id="d196929e4841">"For which I thank God again," devoutly ejaculated Clement. He had been so frightened
                           and heart-sick
                           at the thought of George's death, and felt such glad relief at his deliverance that
                           he could not
                           express himself in any way so earnestly and devoutly as in thanking the Almighty for
                           his care over
                           him.

                        <p id="d196929e4844">They rode on side by side for some distance, George admiring the beautiful scenery
                           and Clement
                           explaining the different kinds of trees and plants indigenous to that country. At
                           length they
                           decided to return home; Clement was fearful of taxing George's strength too severely.
                           The ride home
                           was delightful; the horses behaved admirably. They were soon at home again. At half-past
                           two dinner
                           was served in the best of style, for Clement Howe's servants understood their master's
                           wishes in
                           regard to regularity and good style. George ate with quite a relish, the ride in the
                           keen mountain
                           air had given him a fine appetite. He felt, too, that he had accomplished the desired
                           wish of his
                           dearly loved friend. He had been able to ride the renowned Fleetfoot, and he felt
                           himself
                           established in Clement's good graces.

                        <p id="d196929e4847">Mr. Howe's conduct to George had undergone a marked change. At first he had spoken
                           to him almost in a
                           tone of command as if George was his son, saying, You must do this. or you must learn
                           that. Since
                           that dreadful hour when he saw that mad beast tearing on, as he thought, to destruction
                           with him,
                           and he knew the boy had gone at his command <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="173" data-tei-n="168"> </a></span> against his own
                           inclinations, he then resolved never again to lay a restriction or command on George,
                           but always to
                           speak to him gently and consult his wishes. He was delighted to see him eat with so
                           much relish, and
                           while they were eating he said, 
                           <said id="d196929e4851" who="#chowe">"George, do you know this morning's ride has been
                              a terrible experience to me. If the horse had killed you I should always have felt
                              myself guilty
                              of murder."

                        <p id="d196929e4855">George replied, 
                           <said id="d196929e4857" who="#gkent">"Then you would have accused yourself unjustly, Mr. Howe (George
                              always called his new friend Mr. Howe, and never approached anything like boyish familiarity
                              with him), because you did not compel me to go; I went from choice."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e4866">George looked with candor into the steel-blue eyes bent upon him and replied,

                        <p id="d196929e4871">Clement's answer was worthy of his own noble-hearted self: 
                           <said id="d196929e4873" who="#chowe">"Never try to please
                              me, George, against your own inclinations. Your mind is higher, your perceptions clearer
                              in
                              regard to what you can do than mine are."

                        <p id="d196929e4876">George blushed like a girl at this compliment, and replied, 
                           <said id="d196929e4878" who="#gkent">"No, no, Mr. Howe; my
                              only wish is to please you, and all I want is your command, so I may show you how
                              willing I am
                              to obey."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e4881">Clement's fine eyes glowed with pleasure, as he remarked. 
                           <said id="d196929e4883" who="#chowe">"Rest assured of one
                              thing, dear boy, my commands shall henceforth be such as you can obey without risk
                              to
                              yourself."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4887">By this time they had finished eating. Clement did not use wine at the table; he was
                           strictly
                           temperate. They now repaired to the parlor and spent an hour or two in looking over
                           books and
                           papers, and then Clement gave George an <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="174" data-tei-n="169"> </a></span> other lesson in music.
                           This day was almost a repetition of each day that followed during the summer. George
                           studied hard
                           and was able to recite lessons each evening in history, geography, grammar or music.
                           Clement was
                           pleased with his progress. Each day they took a pleasant ride down the valley or up
                           the steep
                           mountain road leading to the nearest town.

                        <p id="d196929e4892">Sometimes they visited the mining camps, where men were sinking deep shafts into the
                           mountain side;
                           seeking the golden ore so deeply hidden there. One day they were visiting a camp,
                           when the familiar
                           tones of Bill Johnson's voice (the terror of George Kent's trip west)—rang out from
                           a crowd of rough
                           looking fellows, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4894" who="#bjohnson">"Hello, Kent; you are the same girl-boy as ever.
                              Seems to me you are purty well keered for, for a New York boot-black; you seem to
                              be cutting
                              quite a stiff in your store clothes, with your hands and face as white as a gal's.
                              I say, how do
                              you come on, and how is Joe Clifford? Is he as ready to fight for you as ever?"
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4897">George's face flushed crimson for a moment, and the blood dying away left him pale
                           as a corpse. He
                           was finely dressed in a beautiful suit of neat-fitting, navy blue cloth, with gleaming
                           white linen
                           collar and cuffs, and wore a soft felt hat perched jauntily over his shining black
                           curls. He had
                           developed rapidly within the past few months of his sojourn at "Eagle's Eyrie." He
                           was now almost
                           sixteen years of age; his form had filled out and grown plump; his eyes wore a dangerously
                           beautiful
                           glow; his cheeks were plump and smooth as a girl's; his delicate features and color
                           had often roused
                           Clement's curiosity, and he would say, 
                           <said id="d196929e4899" who="#chowe">"George, your hands are too small, and
                              your face too fresh and fair, to ever make a rugged mountain hunter like I am."

                        <p id="d196929e4902">Such talk would only bring a deeper flush to the fair face, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="175" data-tei-n="170"> </a></span> and
                           Clement would refrain from saying more, to spare his dear boy's feelings.

                        <p id="d196929e4907">To-day when Bill Johnson addressed him with so much insolence and contempt and the
                           fair face grew
                           crimson at the rude remarks, a strange look of displeasure flitted over Clement's
                           face, and a heavy,
                           threatening look brooded in the deep blue eyes that boded no good to Bill Johnson;
                           but Johnson,
                           intent on wounding and hurting Kent, advanced from the ill looking crowd and kept
                           using insulting
                           language to the small boy that sat so spiritedly on the dappled gray horse.

                           engaged in
                           conversation with a miner, suddenly wheeled Wildfire around, rode between the bully
                           and George, drew
                           his riding whip, and with one stroke, sent a blinding lash around the bully's neck
                           and face saying,

                           vowed vengeance on
                           George Kent and Clement Howe. Some of the crew laughed, and said,

                           fleet-footed mountain deer went dashing across their path. Clement was wishing for
                           his gun, when a
                           covey of wild turkeys started from a clump of bushes near by. Simultaneously, George
                           and Clement
                           each drew and fired into the flock; each one bringing down a large <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="176" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span> wild turkey. George had practiced shooting with a pistol until he was a good shot,
                           but he had not
                           learned to use a gun yet. They carried their game home and next day had a fine turkey
                           dinner. There
                           was no scarcity of game in that mountain region.

                        <p id="d196929e4963">Spring had crept into summer, with bright and joyous days for George and Clement.
                           Summer sped into
                           autumn, and soon the glowing colors on the forest foliage bade them look for the approach
                           of
                           winter's storm and cold. But that had been one ever-to-be-remembered summer by George.
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="177" data-tei-n="172"> </a></span> He had learned new and strange lessons in his mountain home; his soul had
                           been impressed by the sublime grandeur of the scenery he had looked upon; there were
                           beautiful
                           mountains which were decked with summer's richest verdure, while their lofty tops
                           were crowned with
                           eternal snow. The long summer days were as a dream of Eden to George. He had plenty
                           to eat and
                           plenty to wear, with an abundance of the most beautiful sights for the eye to dwell
                           upon, books and
                           music to instruct the mind, pictures and statuary to entertain the fancy, horseback
                           rides and
                           delightful mountain rambles to occupy the idle hours; but dearer than all, higher
                           to be valued than
                           all else beside, was the company of his dearly loved friend, Clement Howe.

                        <p id="d196929e4968">Day after day they had spent together, until life would seem a desolation to either
                           one to be
                           separated from the other. Clement had grown to love the boy with all the fond affection
                           of a nature
                           like his. He filled the vacuum in his life, soothed the want in his hungry heart,
                           and each day
                           seemed full of perfect content to both.

                        <p id="d196929e4971">One day Clement had a severe nervous headache. Aunt Hope tried her usual remedies
                           without relieving
                           him; he ordered her to go tell George to come to him, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e4973" who="#chowe">"It is strange
                              George never will come to my room unless I send a special request for him, and then
                              he always
                              acts as if he was on forbidden ground."
                           </said> George came, as he was directed: bathed the
                           feverish brow, and soothed the nervous man into quietness with a few gentle strokes
                           of his delicate
                           hands, which Clement declared were too soft and white for anything but to paint pictures
                           or play the
                           piano.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4977">To George there were many long nights of anxiety and regret; he knew he was deceiving
                           Clement in
                           regard to his sex; he was modest and retiring in his manner, shrinking <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="178" data-tei-n="173"> </a></span> from the least familiarity with Clement; and Clement, mistaking his
                           modesty for indifference, felt hurt at his apparent want of interest in his affairs.
                           As the days
                           went by, George grew more and more retiring; often spending the whole day in his own
                           room in deep
                           meditation over his life; he loved Clement with the first deep and tender love of
                           a pure maiden's
                           trusting affection; and yet he was under false colors. He knew Clement liked him for
                           what he
                           believed him to be—a boy that been cast out on the cold charity of the world to care
                           for himself,
                           and he feared the worst should Clement know, in place of a boy, he was a pitiful little
                           girl, who
                           had been cast amid the vilest slums of New York's street society. He felt the blush
                           of shame mount
                           his cheek to think he had been thrown in such a channel, but he was helpless; he knew
                           not who he was
                           or from whence he came. His earliest recollections were of a squalid room, full of
                           vile, low,
                           slatternly women and ragged, hungry-faced children striving, pushing and fighting
                           for the crusts and
                           scraps that were thrown to them, like they were so many little hungry pigs. Here he
                           had scrambled
                           and fought his way with the vile set—always hungry, dirty and cold—until he was sent
                           out to beg;
                           then he ate enough if he could get it, but always gave the pennies and old clothes
                           to the others. As
                           soon as he was able to black boots he went to work, and gradually drifted away from
                           the dens of the
                           low and the vile. He knew such a life would not be remembered against a boy as it
                           would a girl. He
                           felt his own purity of heart and honesty of purpose, but he did not believe Clement
                           would trust him
                           after he had deceived him in regard to his sex.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4982">This day of Clement's severe headache was a hard trial to him; he could not bear for
                           Clement to think
                           ill of him; he longed to throw himself at his feet and acknowledge all; tell <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="174"> </a></span> his weakness, his fear of being cast off; all of his whole miserable
                           life, and then ask Clement to forgive him. He sat by the bedside holding Clement's
                           hand in his own.
                           Soon the face cleared, and the pain seemed to leave him; the hand relaxed its grasp,
                           and he was
                           apparently sleeping. George listened for a moment to the steady breathing, then bending
                           low his head
                           pressed his scarlet lips to the sleeper's brow and murmured, 
                           <said id="d196929e4986" who="#gkent">"Oh, if he only knew
                              all, he would not blame me."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4990">Clement was not sleeping; the pain in his head had grown less severe; the light hurt
                           his eyes, and he
                           lay with them closed. The thrilling, trembling pressure of the scarlet lips upon his
                           brow, and the
                           low, murmured words from the over-charged heart, reached his ear. But he did not betray
                           himself by
                           word or look; he remained silent and still. He now felt assured that the reluctance
                           manifested by
                           George about coming to his room was through no dislike to himself, but through a modesty
                           and fear of
                           intruding himself. He thought to himself, 
                           <said id="d196929e4992" who="#chowe">"Bless his noble heart! He would risk
                              his life to save mine, but he would not intrude himself on me for a moment unasked."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4995">No thought of the truth ever crossed his mind—that George was a girl. Clement believed
                           that he was
                           only a timid, modest, shrinking boy, disliking to put himself forward, on account
                           of his early life
                           being so full of misery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e4998">If Clement had known, or even suspected, the truth, he would have treated George as
                           a lady, and with
                           all due respect for her sex. Much as he disliked women, he was too much of a gentleman
                           to treat them
                           with anything but respect; and besides George having a claim to that respect from
                           Clement, he had a
                           still higher claim—that of gratitude for having saved his life.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d196929e5003">Clement had grown to love the boy with a deep and high regard. He saw George's high
                           sense of honor;
                           he read aright the sentiment of purity in that young heart, and understood with the
                           deep intuition
                           of a kindred spirit the elevated principles of that young mind. He often saw the young
                           face light up
                           with noble thought, and saw the brown eyes kindle with enthusiasm at some fine passage
                           in reading,
                           some beautiful scene in painting, or some grand strain of music. Clement felt that
                           George possessed
                           a high, fine nature to appreciate all these things with so keen a perception. George
                           would have been
                           perfectly safe in making a confidant of Clement, but he did not know it; therefore
                           he suffered much
                           unnecessary pain.

                        <p id="d196929e5006">The beautiful summer had drawn to a close; the nights had grown chilly, and the gay
                           flecking of the
                           forests trees showed signs of the approaching autumn. With the exception of George's
                           trouble in
                           regard to his sex there was no happier human being on earth. The servants were kind
                           and attentive;
                           Clement was affectionate—no wish in his life was denied. In fact all his wants were
                           anticipated and
                           filled before they could become a wish; but for all this there were many long nights
                           that George
                           scarcely closed his eyes in sleep; or slept only to awake with a start from some troubled
                           dream, and
                           think he was discovered and cast out from his lovely home. He could not analyze his
                           own feelings
                           thoroughly;—he loved Clement with all the true devotion of a noble woman's first love;
                           he determined
                           to conceal his affection, and show him only the kind friendship of a boy for a much-loved
                           friend.

                        <p id="d196929e5010">It was now late in September; the fires were kindled in the rooms, and Clement and
                           George spent their
                           evenings in the parlor, busy over books and music. Of late George had <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="181" data-tei-n="176"> </a></span> scarcely slept at all; while sleeping he dreamed of climbing over

                        <p id="d196929e5029">George drew from his neck the beautiful Roman gold locket, set with Oriental rubies,
                           which contained
                           the pictures of his parents, handed it to him, and said,

                              where you get your delicate loveliness. I know from these pictures your parents were
                              persons of
                              culture and refinement.

                        <p id="d196929e5046">George blushed with pleasure at this compliment.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5049">Clement continued, 
                           <said id="d196929e5051" who="#chowe">"But what puzzles me is, the child of such parents should
                              become a street waif in the city of New York. It is evident to me these are your parents—every
                              lineament and feature of your mother is portrayed in your face, with the dreamy sadness
                              of your
                              father's eyes lingering in the depths of your sweet black eyes."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5054">It was a pleasant thought to George to think he came from honorable parents. When
                           he thought he might
                           have been <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="182" data-tei-n="177"> </a></span> the offspring of the low and vile, his cheek burned
                           with shame, and his heart ached with an undefined sadness. Now that Clement saw his
                           resemblance to
                           that beautiful picture, he always believed to be his mother's, he felt a strange thrill
                           of gladness
                           quivering in his bosom. To George, Clement was the personification of goodness and
                           nobility, and his
                           opinions were to be valued higher than all else on earth. That night when he retired
                           he felt too
                           happy to sleep, but lay thinking sweet thoughts of Clement. Hour after hour crept
                           by; the large
                           clock in the hall tolled out the hour of midnight, and still he slept not; some strange,
                           uncanny
                           spirit seemed to be abroad that night, robbing George of his rest. It seemed to him
                           some terrible
                           danger threatened Clement. He knew that Clement was perfectly fearless; that he always
                           slept with
                           his windows open on warm nights, and never kept weapons near him. He had borne a sort
                           of charmed
                           life in the mountains; he had never been robbed or attacked in any way; but of late
                           rumors had been
                           abroad of the mountain robbers having committed several depredations. He thought of
                           these things and
                           grew strangely excited. He almost fancied that some one was ready to murder Clement
                           for the money
                           and costly jewels he possessed. The presentment of evil grew so strong in George's
                           mind that he
                           arose, put on his pantaloons, and with bare feet crept noiselessly to Clement's door.
                           The door stood
                           slightly ajar; he drew it wide open, and by the mighty light of the late moon he beheld
                           a sight that
                           chilled his blood with horror and froze his tongue to silence. There, standing at
                           Clement's bedside,
                           was a tall form, looking down upon the unconscious sleeper with devilish malignity.
                           In his right
                           hand, poised and gleaming, ready for the fatal stroke, was a deadly looking dagger.
                           He seemed to be
                           contemplating <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="183" data-tei-n="178"> </a></span> his victim with fiendish pleasure. He steadied his
                           arm for a blow, and muttered between his clenched teeth, 
                           <said id="d196929e5060" who="#bjohnson">"D—n you; I'll teach
                              you to strike Bill Johnson."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5063">These words seemed to arouse George from the stupor into which terror had thrown him,
                           and with the
                           rapidity of lightning he sprang upon the body of Clement as the blow descended from
                           the assassin's
                           dagger. It missed its aim at Clement's heart, but went crashing through the tender
                           flesh of George's
                           arm and pierced the beautiful white shoulder. The sudden appearance of George on the
                           scene
                           frightened Johnson, who left the bloody dagger, and in his haste to descend caught
                           his foot in the
                           iron trellis-work at the window, fell and stunned himself so badly that he barely
                           made his
                           escape.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5067">Clement awoke in a moment, saw the gleaming dagger descend, and felt the hot blood
                           spurt into his
                           face from George's shoulder. He knew that George had risked his life, if he had not
                           lost it, for his
                           sake. He clasped the boyish form in his arms and sprang to his feet just as Johnson
                           clambered out at
                           the window. He rushed to the bell, rang out a wild peal that brought the servants
                           rushing pell-mell
                           into the room. He placed the fainting form on the bed, and by kindly attention restored
                           George to
                           consciousness. He gave quick and peremptory orders to his servants, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e5069" who="#chowe">"There have been thieves and murderers here. Abel, you and Silas set out to hunt them
                              up, and
                              John, you take the fleetest horse and ride immediately to Roland for a physician.
                              You, Hope and
                              Marinda, get me lights, warm water and bandages."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5072">These orders were issued in less time than I have been writing them. While he gave
                           these orders he
                           sat with the little limp form clasped close to his bosom, and the crimson blood from
                           George's wound
                           was staining his white shirt-front <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="184" data-tei-n="179"> </a></span> and trickling warm against his
                           body. Lights were soon procured, and while the men servants hastened to obey his orders
                           the women
                           stood by, anxiously inquiring what more they could do. Clement's hands shook with
                           dread when he tore
                           away the boy's shirt, saturated with blood, and beheld the ghastly wound that noble-hearted
                           boy had
                           received to save his life. George was in a fainting condition from loss of blood:
                           the villainous
                           dagger had severed the main artery of the arm, cutting to the bone, and had pierced
                           the tender flesh
                           of the body. The bone of the shoulder had turned the cruel blade and saved the boy's
                           life. While
                           Clement bathed the fair, round arm and dimpled shoulder to remove the blood, he started
                           back white
                           and trembling; There, all unconsciously revealed, was Georgie's secret. Clement discovered
                           the soft,
                           glowing bosom and dimpled shoulders of a girl, in place of the firm-knit, solid muscle
                           of a boy's
                           body. He was startled, surprised, shocked for a moment, to think that all these months
                           he had been
                           in daily association with this girl and had not discovered her sex. Then he recalled
                           how modest and
                           retiring the boy had always been; how he had shrank from all familiarity with him,
                           yet he had twice
                           saved his life by his prompt action. He knew that George did not wish his sex revealed.
                           He bathed
                           the wound, examined it closely, and found it was not fatal; he then closed it and
                           bound it up,
                           keeping the delicate form as well covered from the gaping eyes of the servants as
                           he could. He gave
                           George wine to restore her (we shall henceforth speak of her in her right sex), and
                           placed her
                           comfortably upon his own elegant bed. A shuddering sigh welled up from the trembling
                           bosom as the
                           pale lips asked, in quivering tones, 
                           <said id="d196929e5076" who="#gkent">"Are you hurt, Mr. Howe?"</said>

                           <said id="d196929e5110" who="#chowe">"But Uncle Abel and Silas are in
                              search of him. I dispatched John to Roland for a physician, and I remained to care
                              for you. I
                              did not go in search of the murderer, assassin, thief, whatever he is. But really,
                              now, I must
                              be obeyed,"

                              until you are better."
                           </said> He pressed the little hand to his lips, and then held it kindly in
                           the firm grasp of his own, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e5116" who="#chowe">"Sleep, now, my darling child, you will be
                              better soon.

                        <p id="d196929e5119">Georgie closed her eyes and soon sank into a quiet sleep, as he had lost much blood
                           and felt very
                           weak.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5122">Clement sat by this girl-boy and strange emotions flitted through his mind. He knew
                           he could not live
                           with the girl under his care the same as he had with the boy, yet he was loth to give
                           up the child
                           that had twice saved his life, and he had grown to love with a high and true regard.
                           He sat deeply
                           buried in thought for some time. He was too honorable to take advantage of the child's
                           affection for
                           himself to keep her here alone in his mountain home and never let her see or become
                           acquainted with
                           the world. A pang smote his heart at the thought, 
                           <said id="d196929e5124" who="#chowe">"Yes, she is a girl, and will
                              be traitorous as the others of her sex."
                           </said> He gazed upon the innocent, upturned face, the
                           tender mouth with its half parted lips, and the black <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="186" data-tei-n="181"> </a></span> curls
                           clustering around the polished forehead. She was beautiful as an angel in her sleep.
                           The little
                           fingers grasped his with a nervous clutch, a frown gathered on the fair brow, and
                           the unconscious
                           sleeper murmured, 
                           <said id="d196929e5129" who="#gkent">"He will kill him."</said> A rapid spring of her whole body
                           almost lifted her from the bed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5133">Clement spoke soothingly to her, and she sank to sleep again. She was living over
                           that terribe scene
                           of the attempted murder. Clement could not have a hard thought against the child who
                           had twice saved
                           his life, even if she had deceived him and was of the sex he despised so heartily.
                           He resolved to
                           care for her kindly until she was well and then he would place her at some good school,
                           educate her,
                           and when she was grown and married she could come and live with him, and he would
                           love her as he
                           would a daughter or a younger sister. While thoughts like these drifted through his
                           brain Georgie
                           slept, all unconscious that her secret had been revealed. The sleeping lips moved
                           and uttered some
                           inaudible sounds, then the sounds grew distinct and she murmured, 
                           <said id="d196929e5135" who="#gkent">"No, no; he
                              must never know I am a girl; he would hate me and cast me out from his heart and home
                              forever."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5138">Here the voice grew pleading and pitiful: 
                           <said id="d196929e5140" who="#gkent">"I have no home, no friends. Oh,
                              merciful Father! what would be my fate? Alone, alone, yes, yes!"
                           </said> The voice grew loud and
                           firm in delirium now: 
                           <said id="d196929e5143" who="#gkent">"I will; I 
                              <hi id="d196929e5145" style="font-style: italic;">will</hi> ride the horse if he
                              kills me. I will not tell him I am one of the sex he despises so much. He thinks the
                              whole
                              female sex are false and treacherous; we are not. I would tell him I am a girl, but
                              he, like
                              others, would be incredulous. He would not know how my only safety from the low and
                              vicious
                              depended on passing myself for a boy. He could not realize the weary years of my miserable
                              childhood; how, friendless, homeless and nameless, I <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="187" data-tei-n="182"> </a></span> have
                              struggled on. No, no, no,

                              <hi id="d196929e5153" style="font-style: italic;">never</hi> tell him I
                              am a girl. I will drown or shoot myself first."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5157">She was in a raving delirium and strongly threatened with brain fever; she tossed
                           her feverish hands,
                           and no amount of soothing could still her wild raving or cool the burning brain. For
                           days and weeks
                           she had been hovering on the border of a fever, and now that her nervous system had
                           undergone such a
                           shock, she bid fair to have a serious, if not a fatal, attack of brain fever.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5161">Clement was well read in medicine; he immediately applied ice to her head and mustard
                           drafts to the
                           back of the neck, and gave her medicine to reduce her fever. In a few hours he had
                           the pleasure of
                           seeing her sink into a sleep produced by the powerful anaesthetic he had given her.
                           The little, hot,
                           throbbing form grew still, but the red, hot cheeks and feverish eyes all told her
                           dangerous
                           condition. Clement could not be induced to leave her to taste a mouthful of food.
                           Hope and Marinda
                           entered the chamber with silent, awe-stricken faces. They removed the unsightly blood-stains
                           from
                           the floor and furniture, and replaced the soiled bed linen with pure white linen.
                           They prepared
                           their master's breakfast, and Aunt Hope went to him, saying,

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5204">Clement had been so troubled in mind he had not thought of his personal appearance.
                           He arose and
                           retired to his <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="189" data-tei-n="184"> </a></span> dressing room, leaving those kind-hearted
                           creatures in care of Georgie, enjoining strict silence upon them. He bathed his face
                           in fresh, cold
                           water, removed the soiled linen and soon returned to the room. Georgie was still quietly
                           resting. He
                           then seated himself at the table and partook of a slight repast, scarcely tasting
                           the food so
                           carefully prepared. He returned to the bedside and sat sorrowfully thinking of Georgie.
                           He saw the
                           poor little girl seriously wounded and burning with fever; he did not know what the
                           result might be;
                           he feared it might be death. He thought of the months that had gone by since he first
                           met Georgie on
                           the storm-beaten plain. He had always found her kind and obedient; he knew she possessed
                           a high
                           principle, and was the very soul of honor. He understood how a delicate little girl
                           would shrink
                           from telling why she had been led to conceal her sex. He saw at a glance how her life
                           had been
                           safer, her purity kept untarnished, by her male garb. He pitied, with all his noble
                           heart, the
                           lonely, friendless condition of this delicate little girl. He thought of the locket
                           worn by her, and
                           wondered if she had been foully dealt with. Her delicate features, her conduct, her
                           refined manners,
                           all spoke to his practised eye of gentle blood. Ever and anon the sleeper stirred
                           uneasily, and
                           muttered some indistinct word. He would speak soothingly to her, put fresh cold cloth
                           to the burning
                           head, and wait patiently for the physician. He knew he could not expect a physician
                           before the
                           middle of the day.

                        <p id="d196929e5209">Abel and Silas had pursued the would-be murderer down the mountain side, but there
                           lost all trace of
                           him. He made good his escape in the darkness, and returned to the band of outlaws
                           he had joined, and
                           reported of the plate and fine things in the elegant mansion on the mountain side.

                        <p id="d196929e5212">This band of outlaws had become dangerous; they were <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="190" data-tei-n="185"> </a></span> supposed to
                           be led by the noted bandit and desperado, Jesse James. They infested the country for
                           many miles, and
                           had become a terror in the region round about Clement's home.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5217">At noon John returned, saying "Dr. Moore would come as soon as he returned from a
                           patient to whom he
                           had gone."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5220">There was nothing to do but for Clement to wait and attend, the best he knew how,
                           to George. It was a
                           sad day to the servants; they all gathered in the large kitchen with sad hearts. They
                           loved young
                           George, and it was sad to think he might soon be called to battle with the grim monster
                           Death. To
                           the black folks death possessed a terror that religious consolation could not divest
                           of its
                           gloom.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5224">Clement sat at the bedside in silence, hoping for the best, yet fearing the worst.
                           Hour after hour
                           crept by, and still Georgie lay chained to the bed by a powerful opiate, apparently
                           sleeping, but to
                           an experienced eye showing that she was only resting from the medicine. Toward evening
                           she roused up
                           with a wild, fevered glare in her gentle, black eyes, that showed the disease was
                           neither checked
                           nor broken. The servant was again dispatched for the physician; he met him near the
                           house, and
                           returned with him. Dr. Moore pronounced it a case of brain fever, brought on by over-excitement.
                           When he had given the medicine required and examined the wound, an inquiring look
                           came into his eyes
                           when he addressed Clement. He inquired how she had received the wound.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5227">Clement informed him of the attempt to murder himself, and of her interfering in time
                           to save his
                           life at the risk of her own. He told the doctor she was a child he had rescued from
                           death on the
                           plains after the storm; that she had no living relatives, and he had adopted her,
                           which, in truth,
                           he had. He determined to preserve her secret; it was known <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="191" data-tei-n="186"> </a></span> only
                           to himself and servants that Georgie had passed herself for a boy. He resolved to
                           explain to his
                           servants, and have them understand why Georgie had worn male attire; then he intended
                           to have her
                           resume the dress suitable to her sex. For this purpose he made out a list for ready-made
                           clothing
                           for a young girl of twelve, and ordered them sent immediately from the nearest town.
                           He dispatched
                           John with the order and a two-horse wagon to bring home the clothing. He sent the
                           order to an
                           establishment where ready-made clothing was for sale. He sent for the finest and best;
                           also for a
                           fine seal-skin sacque and black silk beaver hat, with drooping plumes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5232">Clement was a connoisseur in dress; he knew ladies required a great many articles
                           of toilet unknown
                           to him by name; yet he sent to have a complete outfit, and sent a check by John to
                           pay for it. He
                           seemed suddenly to have recovered from his antipathy to female dress, from the order
                           he sent out.
                           The establishment to which John carried the order was thrown into a furore of excitement
                           by such an
                           extensive order for female attire from Mr. Howe, as he was known far and wide as a
                           confirmed
                           bachelor and woman-hater. The lady at the head of the establishment surmised and conjectured
                           various
                           things of who it could be. She asked John how large the young lady was that his master
                           had sent the
                           order for. (Clement had not thought to send a measure, and his description was rather
                           vague, as some
                           girls were large, some small, at twelve.)

                        <p id="d196929e5235">John's reply mystified the lady still more. He answered.

                        <p id="d196929e5268">The madam seemed to reflect on the answer for a moment, and then said, "Well, men
                           as a class are hard
                           to understand, and this hermit master of Eagle's Eyrie seems to be worse than the
                           commonality of his
                           class. Here he has sent an order for a complete outfit of clothing, fine enough for
                           a princess, and
                           not a measure or anything by which I can make them, except for a young lady about
                           twelve. Rather a
                           vague order, I must confess. Nevertheless, such orders are not to be slighted; such
                           a windfall of
                           fortune does not occur every day.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5271">She therefore called up the girl who, John said, was about the size of the young person,
                           took her
                           measure, and soon had several shop girls busy preparing such a wardrobe for young
                           Georgie Kent as
                           she had never in her most sanguine hours dreamed of possessing. There were fine linen
                           underwear,
                           beautiful embroidered and frilled night-robes, elegant dresses of the richest silk
                           and cashmere,
                           beautiful handkerchiefs, gloves, ribbons, and tiny little button gaiter boots, with
                           the other
                           hundred and one articles necessary to complete a female outfit. Everything was procured
                           by the
                           energetic madam, and packed in the large trunks that were ordered, and when she presented
                           her bill
                           of six hundred dollars for payment John gave her the check his master had sent to
                           the bank, which
                           called for eight hundred dollars. The madam sighed when she thought she might have
                           invested the
                           spare two hundred with profit to herself. All these things were being prepared for
                           Georgie Kent
                           while she lay in a raging <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="193" data-tei-n="188"> </a></span> fever, hovering between life and death.
                           For several days she remained in a hopeless condition, but a merciful Providence spared
                           her life,
                           and she slowly returned to consciousness and health. When she first became conscious
                           she was in her
                           own room, lying upon her snow-white bed. It was night, a large lamp shed a mellow
                           light over the
                           surroundings in her room; at the table sat a solitary figure in a large easy-chair,
                           reading. She lay
                           for a long time looking at all these things; her memory slowly gained ground until
                           she remembered
                           the terrible scene that had brought her to this bed of illness; she raised her thin
                           hands to gaze
                           upon them, and the rich frills of lace at the wrists of her night-robe first attracted
                           her
                           attention. She wondered where she had gotten such a dress as that; she put the little
                           thin hands to
                           her face, and then she felt a keen pain dart through her wounded shoulder. She lay
                           for a long time
                           wrapped in deep thought; she knew the figure so silently reading at the table was
                           Clement; the noble
                           head and fine form could belong to no other; she knew he was watching beside her in
                           sickness, and
                           wondered how long she had been ill; she could not reckon time; her brain was still
                           too weak to
                           recall anything clearly.

                        <p id="d196929e5276">Clement sat reading for some time; suddenly he raised his head and seemed to be listening
                           intently.
                           He then laid the book aside, got up and approached the bedside; he looked at the pale
                           face and
                           lustrous black eyes for a moment and a great glow of gladness spread over his features
                           like the
                           rising beams of the morning sunshine, lighting up his face with inaffable joy. He
                           saw that Georgie
                           had awoke from her long sleep, conscious and with a clear mind, but very weak. He
                           bent his head low
                           to the pale face and spoke in a low, gentle tone,

                           shapely white hand of Clement, who pressed it to his lips and murmured,

                              you, my child; twice this little hand has been the means of saving my life."

                        <p id="d196929e5289">Georgie lay in a delicious trance of enjoyment; she was too weak to converse much,
                           but she realized
                           that all was right with her much loved friend. He brought a cup of tea and some light
                           toast that
                           Hope had prepared for Georgie, and prevailed upon her to take a little food. He said
                           to her kindly,

                           the door and
                           retired to his own room with better feelings than he had experienced since the night
                           of the

                           was in

                           which Georgie wore, and looked on with mute, inquiring eyes, wondering why she was

                           costly a garment.

                           various
                           fine things to Georgie, too numerous to mention. When she had finished showing Georgie
                           the wardrobe
                           that had been ordered for her, she said,

                           <said id="d196929e5404" who="#gkent">"I think,"</said> replied Georgie, with deep reverence in her voice, 
                           <said id="d196929e5407" who="#gkent">"That God has been very good to me to raise up such a friend as Mr. Clement is to
                              me."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e5411">She understood the true nobility of soul that prompted Clement to shield her from
                           the censure of the
                           servants; he had promptly and tenderly protected her, but the question occurred to
                           her, did he as
                           readily forgive her himself as he was willing to have her exculpated from any fault
                           by the others?
                           She reasoned like to this, 
                           <said id="d196929e5413" who="#gkent">"If he had not forgiven her, why had he sought so
                              earnestly to make her happy?"
                           </said> He had spent days and weeks in waiting upon her; he had <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="197" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span> bought a costly wardrobe for her benefit, and placed a waiting
                           woman at her command; and now she had nothing to do but to rest and get well. No more
                           thought of the
                           morrow; no more working and toiling for a pitiful subsistence; no long, dark nights
                           of gloom and
                           pain; no hopeless future now; but peace and hope, and tranquility of spirit. She would
                           trust
                           Clement; she knew his abhorrence of her sex, but since he had discovered she was a
                           girl and treated
                           her so well surely she had nothing to fear. She knew he had suffered greatly by that
                           other woman's
                           treachery; she knew his life had been dark and solitary, and he had suffered hours
                           of deep wrought
                           pain. But she hoped his troubled spirit would find relief and the heart felt agony
                           he had suffered
                           would be removed forever.

                        <p id="d196929e5419">This little waif on the sea of humanity had a deep and abiding faith in God. The heaven-born
                           spirit
                           of purity in her young heart reached out and grasped hold of the vast truth that was
                           handed down to
                           man in his wretched condition by the Savior who hung bleeding on Calvary's brow, and
                           by his precious
                           blood brought peace and rest to suffering humanity. God works in many mysterious ways
                           his wonders to
                           perform. Here, to this wilderness, he had sent this little waif of want and woe; this
                           helpless
                           little girl of tender years, who was to chain this strong man's affections and lead
                           him back from a
                           life of cruel and bitter hatred to her sex and implant in his heart the germ that
                           would spring to
                           life and bring forth fruit an hundred-fold. This little life that had been risked
                           for him was
                           precious above all others.

                        <p id="d196929e5422">Georgie did not know this, but she felt a perfect trust in Clement. If he could restore
                           her to the
                           rights of her sex in so delicate a manner, and treat her with all the respect due

                           a friend as he had proved himself to be.

                        <p id="d196929e5427">With these thoughts uppermost in her mind, she pressed a kiss upon the flowers he
                           had sent her, and,
                           with them clasped tightly in her frail little hands, she breathed a prayer to heaven
                           for his safety,
                           and sank to sleep.

                        <p id="d196929e5430">Meanwhile, Clement busied himself with looking after his farms and making preparations
                           for the coming
                           winter. He always procured all manner of provisions they would need from the nearest
                           town before the
                           winter set in and the roads got bad. Sometimes, during the winter, the roads were
                           impassable, on
                           account of the severe snow-storms. He sent Uncle Abel and John to town with two large
                           two-horse
                           wagons and orders for family supplies. There had to be pork killed and fat beeves
                           selected from the
                           cattle to supply the meat market at home, beside what game and fish they disposed
                           of. Clement was a
                           bountiful provider; his table groaned under its supply of good things, and his servants
                           were sleek,
                           fat and well fed. His home was a marvel of thrift and plenty; things were kept in
                           order both indoors
                           and out. The days crept by, and Georgie mended slowly, Clement coming to see her each
                           day, and
                           kindly inquiring how she was, and always receiving the same sweet look of gratitude
                           from the gentle
                           black eyes, and the same kind response from the tender lips, "
                           <said id="d196929e5432" who="#gkent">I am better, thank
                              you."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5435">In a couple of weeks from her first consciousness she was so near well she insisted
                           Marinda should
                           dress her and let her go to the parlor in the evening. Clement had gone out for a
                           ride. She
                           persuaded Marinda she was well enough to sit up all day. She had been sitting up a
                           large portion of
                           each day during the week. Marinda gave her a nice bath, brushed the crisp, black curls
                           from the low,
                           broad brow. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="199" data-tei-n="194"> </a></span> The slender little form was very thin and weak.
                           Marinda brought forth a beautiful ruby-colored cashmere, trimmed in ruby satin, with
                           rich lace at
                           the throat and wrists; she brought out the tiny little button boots, that fitted to
                           a nicety;
                           dressed her in fine white embroidered underwear of flannel and linen. With this neat-fitting
                           dress,
                           when her toilet was completed, with a delicate lace handkerchief in the mite of a
                           pocket, and a
                           white rosebud at the throat, she went to a large pier-glass in her room and took a
                           survey of
                           herself. For the first time in her remembrance she was clothed in her right attire.
                           A flush of
                           pleasure crept over her pale face as she surveyed herself in the glass. The locket
                           her mother had
                           given her, of rich Roman gold, set with Oriental rubies, was the only ornament she
                           wore, except
                           rosebuds. Yet she was handsome as a New York belle. Her sickness had removed all traces
                           of sunburn
                           from her hands and face; her delicate beauty was heightened by the becoming dress,
                           and her eyes
                           could not deceive her—she saw she was beautiful; but no vain thought dwelt in that
                           young heart;
                           tears welled up in the black eyes, and heartfelt thanks arose to her lips when she
                           recalled all the
                           trials and vicissitudes through which she had passed.

                        <p id="d196929e5525">It was late when Clement returned home; he did not think of seeing Georgie up and
                           dressed. He entered
                           the parlor unexpectedly to Georgie, and the vision that greeted his eyes was sweet
                           to him as a
                           poet's dream. His own precious little Georgie, so tastefully arrayed in the garments
                           he had chosen
                           for her. He paused for a moment on the threshold to gaze upon this lovely picture.
                           The rich colored
                           dress added a tint to the delicate face; the little hands lay folded calmly on the
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="201" data-tei-n="196"> </a></span> open page of the book, and the mournful eyes were fixed in a steady gaze
                           upon the fire. He advanced into the room, the sad eyes were lifted to meet his, and
                           a glad flash of
                           joy gleamed in their sombre depths as she arose to meet him. He took both her hands
                           in his, and
                           while his deep blue eyes beamed tenderly upon her, said:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5530">

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5537">He did not fold her in his arms, as he had always been wont to do, and call her his
                           dear boy or
                           darling child. Georgie felt a little thrill of disappointment in her heart, but she
                           repressed it and
                           said,

                        <p id="d196929e5542">His face was lighted up with a fond smile. He motioned her to a seat, and drawing
                           a chair near hers,
                           sat down to converse with her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5545">A conscious blush mounted the fair face when she thought he would mention her disguise
                           and ask why
                           she had concealed her sex for so many years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5548">He saw the expectant look on the earnest face, and said kindly, to relieve her embarrassment,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e5550" who="#chowe">"Georgie, you should have trusted me when first we met. It would have been better
                              for both of us."

                           <said id="d196929e5554" who="#gkent">"I know it would, Mr. Howe,"</said> she replied with downcast eyes and burning
                           cheeks; 
                           <said id="d196929e5557" who="#gkent">"but-but I was afraid you would send me away, and you were the only

                           </said> she stammeringly replied, 
                           <said id="d196929e5560" who="#gkent">"you hated girls."</said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5563">He gazed upon the downcast eyes and trembling lips and said, 
                           <said id="d196929e5565" who="#chowe">"Georgie, dear, I
                              never hated you, but I have every reason to respect and love you as a very dear friend.
                              Twice
                              you have been the means of saving my life, once at the risk of your own. Do you think
                              I could
                              hate any one that had done so <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="197"> </a></span> much for me, especially one so
                              helpless as yourself, even if you had done nothing for me?"
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5571">The lustrous black eyes were raised to his, humid with tears. In that timid, beseeching
                           look he read
                           a revelation of pure and truthful affection that language would fail to tell. He understood
                           that
                           child's friendless condition, and he resolved to be a true and earnest friend to her.
                           He spoke
                           kindly, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e5573" who="#chowe">"Tell me, child, how it happened you were sent west as a

                        <p id="d196929e5576"> She related all the incidents in her life, from her earliest recollections up to
                           the present. Her
                           sufferings in the city of New York; the days of hunger and nights of fear and helplessness.
                           She told
                           him her male garb was an advantage in protecting her from insult and abuse; of the
                           weary working
                           days in that crowded city, from which there seemed no redress. She told him of the
                           hope Mr. Whitelaw
                           Reid gave the boys that life would be nobler and better in the west; of the trip west;
                           of Bill
                           Johnson's abuse to her, and Joe Clifford's gallant defense of her; of her terrible
                           sufferings at
                           Jerushy's.

                        <p id="d196929e5579">All this she told him, with trembling lips and aching heart, fearing, when she had
                           finished, he might
                           despise her for her deception. He sat with a look of deep compassion on his noble
                           face, exclaiming,
                           at intervals,

                           </said> and when she had completed her tale of woe, he answered her kindly, saying,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e5584" who="#chowe">"Rest easy from now henceforth and forever, dear child; your trials are all

                        <p id="d196929e5627">Georgie uttered no further word of remonstrance, but sat, pale and silent, like a
                           crushed lily; the
                           color all gone from her face, the glad light from her eyes; the hope was all stricken
                           out of her

                           patient, shrinking little face with a world of suffering in it. A pang smote his heart,
                           and the
                           thought crossed his mind that he had no right to make her suffer so. She was the only
                           person that
                           had ever truly loved him, and what right had he to make her suffer by sending her
                           away from him ?
                           She did not raise her eyes from the fire, but sat patiently waiting to hear what <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="199"> </a></span> more he had to say. Life held no charm for her outside of his presence.
                           He was the sun that daily shed light and joy o'er all for her, and without him life
                           was a hopeless
                           burden.

                        <p id="d196929e5636">He gazed upon her in silence, while his life passed in retrospect before his mind's
                           eye. He was a man
                           thirty-five years of age; he had been cruelly disappointed; silver threads gleamed
                           amid the short,
                           gold curls that clustered around his brow; lines of care had crept around the corners
                           of his eyes
                           and mouth, and he felt aged in mind for a man in the prime of life. He knew there
                           was only one way
                           he could keep Georgie, and that would be as his wife. He knew she was only a child
                           in size, perhaps
                           in years, while he felt quite old under his thirty-five years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5639">In reality Georgie was almost sixteen; she looked much younger, her features were
                           so delicate and her
                           form so slight. He felt it would be wrong to win this child's love and bind her to
                           him in her youth,
                           and when she had grown older she might despise the old man for a husband, and condemn
                           him for taking
                           advantage of her youth and loneliness. These thoughts drifted through his mind, while
                           he sat looking
                           upon her. She never moved or changed; every particle of light and gladness seemed
                           to have died out
                           of that young face forever. He arose, and went to her side; he drew his chair nearer
                           to hers, and
                           taking her limp little hand in his said: 
                           <said id="d196929e5641" who="#chowe">"You are not offended with me, Georgie,
                              for sending you away to make a lady of you?"

                           sounded like the quivering notes of a wounded bird; the hand lay cold and passive
                           in his.

                           with a perfect confidence and faith. Her young heart knew no guile. Such love was

                           love. He told
                           her he must be obeyed, and she must retire early to get the roses back to her cheeks
                           again. He took
                           the little hands in his, and looking down upon the slight form, bade her good night,
                           pressing a kiss
                           upon her pure white brow. He led her to the door and bade her sleep and dream pleasant

                        <p id="d196929e5726">Hour after hour went by, and Clement sat alone in the parlor, reflecting on his life.
                           For years he
                           had been very lonely until he met George. When he thought he had found in the boy
                           the one necessary
                           friend to make him happy he had grown to love the child with a true and tender affection,
                           and when
                           he saw that young life risked to save his own, the tender flesh exposed to the deadly
                           knife to ward
                           the blow from his heart, he felt a deeper, warmer, love for the boy; and when he discovered
                           he owed
                           his life to a timid, shrinking little girl, his great heart thrilled with a tenderness
                           he could not
                           express. He had once looked upon woman's love as the highest, holiest sentiment on
                           earth, but when
                           his love received its death blow from his heart's idol he had grown cold and indifferent
                           to woman's
                           charms, believing women to be a cruel, heartless set. Now he was compelled to change
                           his mind; he
                           did not believe Georgie was false; he would have staked his life on her truth and
                           honesty. He
                           resolved to let the past be forgotten, to live for the present, and let the future
                           care for itself.
                           He would keep Georgie at home, at Eagle's Eyrie <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="208" data-tei-n="203"> </a></span> until she had
                           thoroughly recovered from her illness; he would assist her in her studies and music,
                           and when she
                           was fully recovered he would persuade her to leave him for awhile and go to school
                           at Denver City.
                           He resolved she should have the advantage of school and society before she became
                           his wife. Her
                           little childish notions should be humored until her health was fully restored, but
                           then he would
                           convince her it would be for her good, and his own, too, that she should be better
                           informed. He
                           would then take a house in the city and employ a chaperon for Georgie, and give his
                           little love the
                           advantage of society before he bound her irrevocably to himself.

                           to comprehend the fact that, however happy Clement might make her, she yet needed
                           the womanly
                           training and information that makes woman attractive in the eyes of him she loves.
                           Men, as a class,
                           are hard to understand; they desire a woman to be constantly advancing in beauty and
                           information;
                           they look each day for the unfolding of some new charm, never realizing that woman's
                           highest hopes
                           are attained when she has obtained her husband's love. Too many women sink into nonentity
                           when they
                           are married. They have ascended the loftiest height of which they have ever dreamed,
                           and in <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="209" data-tei-n="204"> </a></span> place of going from one improvement to another, doing something
                           to retain their husband's love, they are constantly retrograding. If the many wives
                           in our land
                           would seek to improve their minds, to make their homes pleasant, to carry peace and
                           order in the
                           daily routine of their duties, and make home, as it should be, a place of rest and
                           comfort, there
                           would be more happy homes, and the husband would seek pleasure at home, where now
                           he seeks it in the
                           crowded barroom or gilded palace of sin.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5740">In wedded life it is meet that each should do his or her part. The husband should
                           bear in mind the
                           many cares that fall to the lot of his wife. Day after day it is the same monotonous
                           round of
                           duties; the same rooms to sweep, the same meals to prepare, the same dishes to wash,
                           cows to milk
                           and children to keep clean. All this requires much head-work as well as hand-work,
                           and where such is
                           woman's lot, it ill becomes her to go through life growling and fretting because her
                           lines have not
                           fallen in pleasant places. Make the best of things! No cloud so dark but it will pass
                           away, and the
                           bright sunshine gild the gloomy places. There is no life so wholly dark but some bright
                           spot will
                           illumine it by and by.

                        <p id="d196929e5743">But I diverge from my subject. These were not the thoughts that occupied Clement's
                           mind; he felt he
                           could be happy with Georgie in her innocent, childish ways; but he felt it would be
                           doing ler
                           injustice to bind her to him irrevocably before she had seen and become acquainted
                           with the ways of
                           the world and learned her own heart. He wanted her to come to him untrammelled by
                           any obligation or
                           feeling of gratitude. He determined to give her the opportunity for improvement, and
                           he believed she
                           would become a lady <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="210" data-tei-n="205"> </a></span> of deep culture; she already possessed the
                           true refinement essential to a lady's character.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5748">At a late hour he retired to rest, but not to sleep; his thoughts were busy with his
                           past sorrow and
                           present happiness. He slept a short time and awoke early. He walked out to his stables
                           to look at
                           his horses. He gazed upon the beautiful scenery the mountain range presented; he followed
                           the
                           tortuous windings of the rapid-flowing river on its downward course. As his eye rested
                           on the
                           beautiful and fertile valley reaching away to the south, different emotions stirred
                           his heart to any
                           he had hitherto experienced since he had lived at Eagle's Eyrie. Thoughts that he
                           would some day be
                           a husband, and perhaps a father, and his sons and daughters would occupy this beautiful
                           mountain
                           home, thrilled his heart with a strange, deep tenderness. Yesterday morning he had
                           looked upon this
                           same scene with indifference; then he was a single man, a confirmed bachelor. This
                           morning such
                           bright, new thoughts came to him; he seemed to stand on the threshold of a new existence,
                           and all
                           because he had some one to occupy his thoughts─some one to love. The little, slender
                           form that had
                           upheld him during the terrible storm and saved his life, and the same tender form
                           had shielded him
                           from the assassin's knife, had found a place in his heart he had deemed forever closed
                           to woman's
                           tender influence. But now the fountain of his great heart was unloosed, and he poured
                           a copious flow
                           of adoration at his loved one's feet. His every thought was mingled with some tender
                           sentiment of
                           his beautiful darling; the very earth would have been dreary to him without her affection.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5751">He returned to the house and soon the bell summoned him to breakfast. Georgie was
                           neatly dressed in
                           white with rose-colored ribbons at the neck and waist. She was, if possible, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="211" data-tei-n="206"> </a></span> more lovely than she was the evening before. A look of perfect
                           contentment had settled over her features; she greeted Clement with a shy tenderness
                           in her face
                           that was very precious in his eyes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5756">Do not scoff, gentle reader; this hero of mine had been so many years a skeptic in
                           regard to woman's
                           love, he had considered it a myth─a something that existed only in the weird fancies
                           of men's
                           brains. He now believed it to be a veritable reality. He loved this girl of tender
                           years with all
                           the deep and abiding love of a heart like his. This love glowed in his face, beamed
                           in his eyes, and
                           thrilled in his voice. He led her to the table, and seated her with all the politeness
                           and true
                           gentlemanly ease in the world. Though he had been long absent from ladies' society,
                           the inborn
                           respect he had for woman had never died, and though he at times believed he hated
                           women, yet the
                           perfect gentleman showed in all his acts. He helped her to the best that bountifully
                           spread table
                           afforded, yet she scarcely tasted the food, but sat toying with her spoon; tasting
                           the fragrant
                           coffee, while Clement made a hearty meal of his breakfast.

                        <p id="d196929e5760">After breakfast Clement inquired if she would like to take a ride that day. The memory
                           of her first
                           ride flashed over her mind, and her face became crimson.

                        <p id="d196929e5763">Clement hastily spoke, saying he had sent by John to procure a lady's saddle for her,
                           when he sent
                           for her wardrobe.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5766">She brightened up immediately, and signified her willingness to go.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5769">What was her surprise upon entering the room, to find Marinda unfolding a beautiful
                           riding habit of
                           dark green. He had also procured a fine black riding-hat, with drooping white plumes
                           of ostrich
                           feathers. She admired the beautiful <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="212" data-tei-n="207"> </a></span> hat and habit, and donned
                           them so as to be ready and not keep Clement waiting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5774">Soon his pleasant voice was heard calling cheerily, 
                           <said id="d196929e5776" who="#chowe">"Come, Georgie; John has
                              brought the horses around, and Fleetfoot is anxious to try his speed."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5779">They soon mounted and descended the mountain side at a gentle pace. That was a glorious
                           ride to
                           Georgie. She sat on Fleetfoot with all the ease and elegance of a trained rider; her
                           neat-fitting
                           habit displayed her figure to advantage, and the black hat with its drooping plumes
                           was becoming to
                           the short curls of jet clustering about her fair forehead. They rode on in silence
                           for some time,
                           Georgie rapt in pleasing admiration of the beautiful landscape. Autumn had scattered
                           her brilliant
                           hues over the forest and nature reveled in a grand display of gorgeous colors. The
                           noisy mountain
                           stream went dashing down into the canon, scattering pellucid drops of water, clear
                           as crystal, to
                           please the eye and quench the thirst of many God-created beings.

                        <p id="d196929e5783">Clement was gazing upon his beautiful betrothed, almost oblivious to other surroundings.
                           Georgie
                           turned her eyes from the grand picture of nature to meet the ardent gaze of her betrothed
                           husband,
                           bent upon her, rapt in admiration. Her sensitive mouth quivered, and her soul-lit
                           eyes glowed with
                           happiness. Georgie felt a rapture inexpressible creep into her inmost being, and she
                           exclaimed
                           almost inaudibly, 
                           <said id="d196929e5785" who="#gkent">"How beautiful! Oh, how beautiful this earth seems to me

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5788">To her poor overburdened and harrassed life had come the soothing, tranquilizing peace
                           of love; she
                           was not living in a false position now; Clement knew all, and had not turned her away.
                           She was too
                           young and simple-minded in the ways of the world to think there could be any harm
                           in her <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="213" data-tei-n="208"> </a></span> living on with him forever, regardless of society or marriage bonds; but
                           Clement was a gentleman in principle; he took no advantage of the trusting love she
                           gave him. He had
                           promised her she should not be separated from him, but he determined to win her consent
                           to that
                           separation until she had gone to school awhile.

                        <p id="d196929e5793">They enjoyed their ride, returned home to a late dinner, and spent the evening with
                           their books and
                           music. This was but a repetition of each day's living for several weeks, until Georgie's
                           health was
                           fully restored and her cheeks blossomed like a new-blown rose. She grew more beautiful
                           each day, and
                           Clement became more infatuated with her tender beauty and winsome manners.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5796">The short autumn days were drawing to a close, and winter, stern and gloomy, had already
                           sent its
                           keen blast drifting down from icy regions to warn the people of its coming. Clement
                           knew he must
                           send Georgie away to school before the mountain roads became impassable. He knew it
                           would be a
                           bitter day to poor Georgie when she was told she must go; she had trusted him so entirely,
                           believing
                           he would not send her away. Day after day went by, and still he could not muster courage
                           sufficient

                        <p id="d196929e5799">He had been busy most all day, the day of which I write, and Georgie had been very
                           lonely. When he
                           came in for dinner, and Georgie met him, she was so glad that she could not hide the
                           pleasure in
                           face and voice. She said naively,

                        <p id="d196929e5804">He told her he should remain in-doors after dinner, as he wished to discuss an important
                           matter with
                           her. They <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="214" data-tei-n="209"> </a></span> repaired to the parlor, where they talked of almost
                           every subject but the one Clement most desired to discuss.

                        <p id="d196929e5815">A quick look of fear darted into her eyes, as she lifted them to his face. She made
                           no reply.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5818">He continued, 
                           <said id="d196929e5820" who="#chowe">"Georgie, I do not want you to think ill of me; I know I promised
                              you I would not send you away; but Georgie,"
                           </said> and here his voice grew husky with emotion,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e5823" who="#chowe">"I love you with a love too pure to keep you here alone and take advantage of
                              your youth by binding you to me ere you had learned the ways of the world and know
                              your own

                        <p id="d196929e5826">There came into Georgie's eyes the same old patient look she had worn so long ago.
                           No words of
                           remonstrance; no pettish tears, but a patient, waiting sadness, that seemed to say,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e5828" who="#gkent">"My heart is breaking; my life drifting away under this command of yours, but I

                        <p id="d196929e5831">He paused, and waited for reply. She gave him none. He looked at the little face,
                           which a few short
                           moments ago was full of gladness unspeakable; now a gray pallor had settled over it,
                           and the loving
                           eyes were bent earnestly upon the fire smouldering in the grate. He arose, went to
                           her side, seated
                           himself beside her, and spoke kindly, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e5833">"Look at me, Georgie; speak to me; do not
                              condemn me so bitterly by that face of yours."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e5836">He drew the shrinking little form close to his heart and held her there tenderly,
                           and gently stroking
                           the short black curls back from the low broad bow. She felt that was her sweetest
                           resting place,
                           near the throbbing heart of her beloved, and she felt, if he desired her to do a thing,
                           it was her
                           duty to obey. And when she lifted her head from its resting <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="215" data-tei-n="210"> </a></span> place
                           near his heart, there was a firm determination in that little face to battle for the
                           right, to obey
                           Clement, and go to school, even if she went contrary to her own inclinations.

                        <p id="d196929e5842">Georgie had learned the lesson of patience and submission in her young days. Although
                           her resolution
                           to do right and give implicit obedience to her best friend gave her a heartache, nevertheless
                           she
                           resolved to go to school. She would leave her pleasant home, her dearly loved friend,
                           and go among
                           strange young ladies who had had every opportunity of improvement, while her lot had
                           been cast among
                           the lowly ones of earth. She knew she must study hard, and try to become worthy of
                           Clement's love,
                           so he would not be ashamed of his little girl-wife.

                              of kindness
                              in my life, you are my only friend, and I feel like, when I give you up, I am utterly

                        <p id="d196929e5850">He pressed her nearer his side, and exclaimed,

                              friendless your life has been, and I shall strive to make you happy; but I feel you
                              are capable
                              of vast improvement, and as your best friend, your lover and betrothed husband, it
                              becomes my
                              duty to be separated from you for awhile, so you may become an accomplished young

                        <p id="d196929e5855">Georgie had now become reconciled to his views. He told her they would start on the
                           following morning
                           for Denver, where she would remain for two years; that he would visit her at intervals,
                           and when she
                           had finished her education they would be married, if she was still in the notion of
                           marrying an old
                           man like himself. He said this sorrowfully, thinking how dreary his life would be
                           without his
                           darling.

                              you, and I will be very lonely when you are gone, but you must sometimes think of

                           bade her good-night, and told her to be ready to breakfast with him early next morning.

                           others to be won
                           away from him, perhaps. Yet he felt it his duty, and he became more reconciled.

                        <p id="d196929e5955">Things looked gloomy to Dr. Throop. He did not doubt his young wife's truth, but he
                           felt she was
                           concealing something from him. Their journey to Denver was soon completed, and they
                           stood in the
                           streets of the great western emporium and watched the crowding thousands, and while
                           they looked both
                           felt a nameless pang shoot through their hearts. Horace wondered if he should find
                           the face he had
                           followed half across the continent. Dr. Throop thought of Georgia's delicate little
                           girl, and his
                           sorrow-stricken bride; while Adelaide mourned in secret for her dead brother, and
                           dreaded to tell of
                           his dishonored life and sudden death. The clouds of misfortune seemed for awhile to
                           envelop them
                           with its gloomy pall. Each one of the party felt dreary beyond all expression. They
                           had taken rooms
                           at an elegant hotel, and Dr. Throop had pressed a well-filled purse into Adelaide's
                           hand, telling
                           her to replenish her wardrobe. Adelaide could not think of dressing in gay colors
                           so soon after her
                           brother's death. She purchased a handsome black silk, also a fine black cashmere.

                        <p id="d196929e5966">She colored painfully; there was something in her manner that showed Dr. Throop she
                           was concealing
                           something from him. How plain the least coolness is to those we love; how perceptible
                           the lightest
                           change of manner. Dr. Throop felt, that in some undefinable manner, Adelaide had drifted
                           into a
                           channel separate from his love; he felt that some undercurrent of grief, regret or
                           distaste to
                           himself had suddenly been roused in her nature. For the first time a thought came
                           into his noble
                           heart that she had married him in haste, because of her helpless condition, and when
                           she had time to
                           realize her situation had turned from him with loathing, because he had forced himself
                           upon her.
                           Then he thought she might have had a former lover and her heart had gone out after
                           him in vain
                           regrets after she had become his bride. The first doubt of her truth flitted through
                           his mind and he
                           became miserable. The following lines are expressive of his unhappy condition:

                           intruding himself in her room at the hotel. He had procured two rooms for her, bedroom
                           and parlor,
                           and conversed with her for awhile about the beauties of Denver. When night came he
                           sat in her parlor
                           for awhile, and told her of his hopes of meeting or hearing from Georgia's child amid
                           the great mass
                           of emmigration west. He told her he anticipated trouble in finding her. He then told
                           her of
                           Clifford's hopeless life, but never a <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="220" data-tei-n="220"> </a></span> word of the deep sorrow

                        <p id="d196929e5997">Poor Adelaide tried to appear interested; she longed to throw herself in his arms
                           and tell him of her
                           brother's unhappy fate, and beg his pardon for deceiving him into a marriage with
                           one whose name was
                           so deeply disgraced; but each lacked the courage to broach the subject nearest their
                           hearts. If they
                           could have read each other's feelings, how differently they would have felt. They
                           both suffered
                           untold agonies, which a few moments of true and open conversation would have set aside,
                           and made
                           them happy as the angels in heaven; but they suffered on in doubt, and when the time
                           came to retire,
                           Dr. Throop arose, and with trembling hands and aching heart bade her good-night. He
                           pressed the hand
                           lightly to his lips, while his whole frame was trembling with deep emotion, and he
                           longed to clasp
                           her to his throbbing heart and cover her sweet face with kisses, such as only a loving
                           husband can
                           give; and yet he feared she would shrink from him, because he forced himself upon
                           her in marriage;
                           while she fondly hoped, to the last minute, he would stay with her as her husband
                           and protector,
                           share her room and forgive her for marrying him and bringing his good name to disgrace
                           by
                           association with that of a murderer. They each retired to their separate rooms, but
                           not to
                           sleep.

                        <p id="d196929e6000">Adelaide lay silent, with wide-open black eyes, thinking what was best for her to
                           do. Ought she to
                           offer to leave him, tell him of her brother's misfortune, and beg his forgiveness
                           for accepting him?
                           She felt he was the only man on earth she could ever love; she looked upon him as
                           the noblest, best
                           man in existence, and when she felt that he doubted her it was misery to her almost
                           beyond
                           description <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="221" data-tei-n="216"> </a></span> She prayed in secret, asking the care and guidance of
                           the great All-Father, and trusting him implicitly, believed he would send peace to
                           her troubled
                           heart. She had a deeply religious nature, and she felt, though the dark clouds of
                           affliction should
                           hover over her for awhile, the bright sun of gladness would burst once more in all
                           its radiance over
                           her troubled head. Thus praying and trusting, she sank asleep.

                        <p id="d196929e6006">Dr. Throop was a strong, well balanced man; a man of high and noble principle; of
                           sound judgment and
                           common sense; but he was terribly upset by the bride's manner. He thought she ought
                           to have asked
                           him to share her room; he remembered she was not afraid to call him to sit beside
                           her on that
                           lonely, storm-rent prairie, when the hungry wolves were howling in the dreary night
                           time, and she
                           was alone and helpless; but here (and his heart grew bitter at the thought) she is
                           surrounded by
                           friends; she cares not for her husband's love; she is grieving for the lover she had
                           proven false to
                           in an hour of weakness. He was restless and unhappy; he walked the floor and almost
                           felt like
                           swearing. The great strong man shook with the emotion in his soul; he cried out, 
                           <said id="d196929e6008" who="#fthroop">"Oh, Adelaide, Adelaide! I would rather you had died on that dismal prairie than
                              to live to deceive me. Then you were all my own, my beautiful, peerless love; and
                              here, oh,
                              bitterness! you recoil from the heart that loves you, the husband that adores you."

                           but he
                           remembered the terrified look that swept over her face when she recovered from that
                           fainting fit and
                           cried out,

                           </said> He felt his presence was offensive to her, and his pride revolted at
                           her scorn of him; and he thought <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="222" data-tei-n="217"> </a></span> he would not intrude himself on
                           an unwilling bride. He would work and wait until she would come to him of her own
                           sweet will, and
                           say,

                        <p id="d196929e6027">He knew she was a high, pure-minded woman, and he felt that some inward grief had
                           for a time overcome
                           her; that she must have time to recover from her secret sorrow, whatever it was. 
                           <hi id="d196929e6029" style="font-style: italic;">Secret</hi> sorrow! The thought roused his bitterness again. What right had his wife to hold
                           secrets from him? The thought was maddening, and the devil of doubt took possession
                           of that noble
                           heart and wrung and tortured it with its soul-destroying power; and that noble man
                           became for a time
                           a demon in disposition and thought. He could not stand the confinement of his room;
                           he wandered
                           forth into the streets where the roar and tumult of the city seemed more in sympathy
                           with his
                           troubled heart. He felt that life was a failure, and he had rather die than to live
                           and be tortured
                           with jealous doubts and fears, such as he now experienced.

                        <p id="d196929e6033">On and on he walked, reckless in his mind and regardless of the course he was taking.
                           Suddenly two
                           masked men darted out from a by-alley; one dealt him a blow on the back of the head,
                           while the other
                           grasped him by the throat and choked him senseless. They rifled his pockets and left
                           him for dead,
                           alone in the street, at dead of night, in a strange city. Here he was found early
                           next morning in an
                           insensible condition. The blow on the head had stunned him; the night had chilled
                           him; his mind was
                           driven to a pitch of distraction by his troubles before he received the blow, and
                           he was now in what
                           doctors would call a very precarious situation.

                        <p id="d196929e6036">He was taken to a hospital more dead than alive. When <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="223" data-tei-n="218"> </a></span> the
                           attending physician at the hospital was called in he examamined the wounds on the
                           head and saw they
                           were very bad, but not fatal; he also saw the man was in a high state of mental anxiety,
                           and in his
                           delirium raved constantly for Adelaide. One moment he would speak in low, pleading
                           tones, telling
                           her she was his own loved wife, his precious darling. The next moment he would cover
                           his face with
                           his hands and shriek,

                        <p id="d196929e6043">The doctor saw his patient was of the highest class by his appearance; his clothes
                           were fine and his
                           face bore the unmistakable stamp of culture and refinement. All his surroundings bespoke
                           the
                           gentleman of ease and fortune. He made inquiries of how the man came to be left at
                           the hospital. He
                           soon learned that he had been found alone and apparently dead in the street. He immediately
                           inserted
                           an advertisement in the 
                           <hi id="d196929e6045" style="font-style: italic;">News</hi>, giving a description of the doctor and telling of
                           his dangerous condition. This advertisement caught the eye of Adelaide, who was in
                           a state as near
                           approaching insanity as a person with good sense can well be.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6050">She had sank to sleep, and awoke early in the morning with an undefined sense of dread
                           in her mind.
                           She resolved to tell her hushand all, and throw herself at his feet and ask his forgiveness
                           for not
                           telling him before they were married. She arose, took a bath, arrayed herself in a
                           neat fitting
                           dress, and waited, hoping her husband would come to her parlor to escort her to breakfast,
                           or order
                           breakfast in their room. This she hoped he would do, so she would be able to tell
                           him all her
                           troubles, and set her heart at rest. Hour after hour she waited anxiously, hoping
                           he would come. At
                           length she could stand it no longer, but decided to go to his room. What were her
                           consternation and
                           dismay upon entering his room, to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="224" data-tei-n="219"> </a></span> find it had not been occupied
                           during the night. There lay his overcoat where he had flung it down; in the side pocket
                           was an
                           account book and a large sum of money. She thought, perhaps, he had gone out on business,
                           and had
                           been detained. She returned to her own room, and waited, in a state of great mental
                           anxiety another
                           half hour; then she wrote a note, and sent it to Mr. Clifford, asking him to come
                           to her room for a
                           few moments. Horace came immediately, for he had grown very lonely, thinking Dr. Throop
                           had
                           forgotten him in the society of his bride. What was his surprise to learn that Dr.
                           Throop had not
                           been seen since the night before.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6055">Adelaide disliked to tell him of the coolness existing between them. She merely said
                           he had returned
                           to his room at an early hour the evening previous, and she had not seen him since.
                           This troubled
                           Horace, for he did not think Dr. Throop would have absented himself from his young
                           bride
                           purposely.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6058">They had no clue to his whereabouts. They immediately began to make inquiries at the
                           hotel. One of
                           the night watches remembered seeing Dr. Throop leave the hotel about midnight; that
                           was the last
                           seen of him. This news threw Adelaide into a terrible state of suffering; she imagined
                           he was
                           murdered or hurt in some way; she felt he would not absent himself from them if he
                           could help
                           it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6061">Horace went immediately to the head of the police force in Denver, and soon had several
                           able
                           detectives in search of the missing man. What a wretched day that was to poor Adelaide
                           can be better
                           imagined than described. The past few days of her life had been days of suffering
                           and trial. First
                           she had been injured by the storm, and the few days following had been days of pain
                           and exposure;
                           immediately following her wedding came the disastrous news of her only <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="220"> </a></span> brother's death; then the estrangement from her husband, which the secret
                           she was concealing had caused, and now came her husband's strange disappearance. This,
                           altogether,
                           drove her into a state bordering on frenzy. Each hour of that terrible day seemed
                           a week long to
                           Adelaide. The injury her spine had sustained from the storm prevented her walking,
                           or she would not
                           have stopped off her feet; but her back was so painful she could not walk constantly;
                           she sat in a
                           chair, white, hopeless, despairing.

                        <p id="d196929e6066">If Dr. Throop could have seen his bride then he never would have doubted her love
                           again. She moaned
                           out in tearless agony, 
                           <said id="d196929e6068" who="#astuart">"Oh, my husband! my darling love! Where is he to-day? I

                              given him my
                              confidence, and he would have told me where he was going."
                           </said> She cried out pitifully, 
                           <said id="d196929e6071" who="#astuart">"Oh, Frank, Frank! If I ever see you again we will never be separated for a

                        <p id="d196929e6074">The waiting girl brought food to the desolate bride, but she could not taste it; life
                           was cheerless,
                           food tasteless and death preferable to the state she was in at present. The kind-hearted
                           girl urged
                           her to take a cup of tea, telling her no doubt her husband had been called to some
                           friend in
                           distress, as he was a physician. This in a measure restored her, and she thought it
                           possible he
                           might have been called for in a case of extremity, where it was impossible for him
                           to send her word.
                           She knew so little of his former life, she thought, perhaps, he had friends in Denver,
                           where he was
                           unavoidably detained. She consented to eat a morsel of toast and drink some tea, which,
                           in a
                           measure, restored her strength. She sat wrapt in deep thought, with great anxiety
                           on her
                           countenance.

                           Throop she might find something in its columns to divert her mind from her troubles.
                           Almost the
                           first item that caught her eye was the advertisement inserted by the thoughtful physician
                           who had
                           the care of Dr. Throop at the hospital. There was no way by which she could identify
                           this strange
                           man as her husband except by seeing him. She immediately called a carriage and ordered
                           the driver to
                           take her to the hospital named, where she was soon by her husband's side, listening
                           to the wild
                           ravings of his delirium. How bitterly she reproached herself for this suffering. She
                           felt if she had
                           invited him to her room, instead of driving him away, as she did the night of her
                           marriage, there
                           would have been none of this suffering. The doctor was tossing and raving as only
                           a strong man in a
                           burning fever, with a troubled mind, can rave.

                        <p id="d196929e6086">Adelaide took her place at his bedside, and soon her light touch upon his forehead
                           and soothing voice
                           had the power to lull him to a temporary rest. She sent immediately for Horace, who
                           came, pale and
                           worn from his anxiety of mind and pain of body, as his arm had become very painful
                           from its recent
                           hurt. Together they watched beside the sick man, and Adelaide listened in sorrow to
                           his ravings
                           about her conduct. He would say,

                              some overpowering grief that drives her to this coolness, this set despair; she would
                              not have
                              married me had she loved another."

                           beautiful face
                           of his wife. She bent her face to his, and pressed a long, loving kiss upon his polished
                           forehead.
                           That kiss was the seal of forgiveness to him for doubting her, and the emblem of her
                           undying love
                           for him. It was all his weary heart desired. A look of tender love lighted up the
                           blue eyes; he put
                           his weak arms around her, and drawing her close to his heart, whispered,

                        <p id="d196929e6155">With steadfast purpose and determination, Joe and Mr. Brown had toiled for several
                           weeks; during that
                           time they had amassed quite a fortune. Now their main work lay in getting their treasure
                           to the
                           nearest station without being robbed. The mountains were infested with a band of cut-throats,
                           who
                           had committed various depredations upon miners and settlers in that region. They packed
                           as much of
                           the treasure about them as they could carry in safety. They then took the strong hide
                           of a mountain
                           deer they had killed, sewed it in strong bags, filled them with the precious ore,
                           and prepared for
                           their return to Leadville. They stored the remainder of the ore in the cave, closed
                           the entrance
                           with rock, and replaced the vines so as to cover the entrance to the cave. They marked
                           the entrance
                           by a figure "4" cut in the stone, so as to distinguish the place where the fortune
                           was placed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6158">They now prepared their breakfast, and when they had eaten, they packed a hamper of
                           dried venison and
                           hard bread <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="229" data-tei-n="224"> </a></span> for their journey. They were heavily laden with
                           provisions and ore, and their walk through the mountains was very toilsome. They journeyed
                           on two
                           days undisturbed; on the evening of the third day they camped for the night on the
                           side of a
                           mountain, where a clear stream of water trickled down its side. They did not build
                           a fire for fear
                           of attracting attention from the roving bands of Indians. Rumors were afloat of the
                           savage hordes of
                           Utes, led on by their notorious chief Drifting Goose, who were killing and robbing
                           people, burning
                           and destroying all the property they could find within several hundred miles. So,
                           with the fear of
                           the mountain robbers and the savage Indian tribes, they felt themselves in danger
                           of losing both
                           life and property. The shadows of night fell heavily around them on the mountain side.
                           They felt an
                           unaccountable gloom pervade their hearts on that night. The distant roar of the mountain
                           stream as
                           it dashed madly on through dark canons, sounded ominously to their listening ears.
                           At length, tired
                           out with their day's journey, they sank to sleep, and near midnight they were aroused
                           by the loud
                           swearing and rude jesting that came from a band of armed men who were camped but a
                           short distance
                           from them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6164">Simultaneously, Joe and Mr. Brown sprang to their feet, grasped their swamp angel
                           six-shooters in
                           their hands, and prepared to do battle instantly. They listened for some time. They
                           soon found out
                           that the robbers were ignorant of their whereabouts. There were ten of them in number,
                           and from the
                           conversation Joe and Mr. Brown overheard, they soon discovered they had three prisoners
                           in their
                           hands, which they were intending to dispose of—two men and one woman.

                        <p id="d196929e6167">Joe's heart throbbed heavily in his bosom as he thought of his own dear mother, and
                           he resolved to
                           help rescue the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="230" data-tei-n="225"> </a></span> woman from their vile clutches or die in the
                           attempt. The two men were bound hand and foot with strong ropes, and tied to a tree,
                           while the woman
                           was firmly secured a short distance from them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6172">Joe and Mr. Brown listened to their hellish schemes, and their hearts burned within
                           them; they
                           intended to shoot the men at daylight while they were still bound to the tree, and
                           take the woman to
                           their mountain cave and consign her to a life of hopeless misery with a band of mountain
                           robbers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6175">Joe and Mr. Brown knew their only chance lay in releasing the two men and placing
                           arms in their
                           hands; then attack the robbers suddenly, each taking his aim and killing his man at
                           the first shot.
                           This would leave six more fierce, reckless villains to deal with. They learned that
                           the rendezvous
                           of the robbers was about five miles distant, in a westerly direction, and hither they
                           intended to
                           pursue their way in the morning.

                        <p id="d196929e6178">After a time they subsided into quietness, and Joe and Mr. Brown felt that now was
                           their time if they
                           would rescue those men from the red hand of lawless murder.

                        <p id="d196929e6181">Away on the mountain side a wild night-hawk sent up a shrill shriek and the distant
                           roar of falling
                           waters made the hour and the scene ten times more gloomy. One man was left on guard
                           while the others
                           slept. Slowly and cautiously Joe and Mr. Brown crept nearer the bound men. They crept
                           close to the
                           trees and uttered a low 
                           <said id="d196929e6183">
                              <hi id="d196929e6184" style="font-style: italic;">"hist,"</hi>
                           </said> saying in a whisper, 
                           <said id="d196929e6187">"Be quiet;
                              we are friends."
                           </said> They then severed the ropes that bound them; released them, and placed a
                           loaded revolver in the hands of each.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6192">Joe whispered, 
                           <said id="d196929e6194" who="#jclifford">"Be still, just in the position you are; do not move until we
                              are all ready for action. That guard is evidently drunk or half asleep, and all we
                              have to do is
                              to <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="231" data-tei-n="226"> </a></span> bind and gag him in order to conquer the others."
                           </said>
                           Slowly and cautiously, Joe crept up behind the burly figure, and with the rapid, supple
                           power of a
                           tiger, he seized the unsuspecting man by the throat, jerked him backward to the earth,
                           choked him
                           into silence, and in less time than it has taken me to tell it gagged and bound him.
                           He was just
                           returning to Mr. Brown and the other, when the leader of the band awoke, and, springing
                           to his feet,
                           scented danger in the camp. A shrill call to arms roused the sleeping band of armed
                           men, and they
                           sprang to their feet ready to fire. Our men resolved to sell their lives as dearly
                           as possible, and
                           before the robbers were fairly awake a deadly volley of shot was poured into their
                           midst, carrying
                           sudden death to four of their number and dismay to the remaining ones. The other five
                           thought they
                           were surrounded by a band of armed men. They fled in every direction, leaving their
                           dead and wounded
                           uncared for. This was what our friends desired. They did not wish to kill any more
                           human beings than
                           it was strictly necessary they should to enable them to preserve their own lives and
                           liberty. For a
                           few moments all was confusion; the woman still remained bound to the tree, but as
                           soon as the danger
                           was past one of the men rushed to her, severed the cords that bound her, and clasping
                           her to his
                           heart, cried out,

                           and with dry lips
                           whispered,

                           Clifford.
                           They had left Denver for Leadville; had arrived at Leadville and determined to visit
                           all the mining
                           localities in that vicinity, and see if they could learn any thing of the boys they
                           had come west to
                           seek. They procured some mountain ponies, and had for several weeks been traveling
                           through the
                           country, admiring the mountain scenery, camping out at nights and gaining health and
                           strength in the
                           bracing mountain air. They had been attacked and captured by a band of robbers, who
                           had overtaken
                           them in an out-of-the-way place, and were now taking them to their mountain rendezvous,
                           where they
                           intended to put the men to death, and keep Adelaide for a fate far worse than death.
                           Had it not been
                           for the timely meeting of Joe and Mr. Brown with the robber band, they would have
                           carried out their
                           nefarious intentions.

                           bonds of hatred in
                           that young heart, and turned the tide of bitter contempt to love and pity. When they

                           sufficient calmness to converse easily, Dr. Throop kindly inquired to whom they were

                           their rescue.

                        <p id="d196929e6296">Joe's young bosom heaved with emotion; he remembered his mother's life of struggle
                           and hardship; the
                           chilling want in the tenement house in New York; the old dark days when his mother
                           had toiled with
                           her needle to keep the wolf from the door; the crusts of bread and cold potatoes that
                           had been so
                           carefully hoarded to keep them from starvation; the memory of the stigma cast upon
                           his mother's
                           name; the suffering she had endured—all passed in rapid review before his young mind,
                           and a feeling
                           of revulsion crept into his heart. Then he recalled her parting words to him: 
                           <said id="d196929e6298" who="#abclifford">"If you should ever meet your father, Joe, be kind to him. It may be that I
                              have done wrong in hating him so bitterly."
                           </said> Joe remembered his mother's precious words,
                           and a mighty sob shook his young frame. He had always obeyed <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="235" data-tei-n="230"> </a></span> that
                           mother; she was the one sole being upon earth he had looked upon with fervent love
                           and respect; and
                           now, when he recalled her wishes, he determined to obey her. Hot tears crept from
                           the burning blue
                           eyes and washed away all the hatred his young heart had cherished toward his father.
                           In the place of
                           contempt, pity crept into his heart, and his father found a strong advocate in his
                           son, and one who
                           would plead for his forgiveness from his mother.

                        <p id="d196929e6304">That night, though fraught with so much danger and suffering to the little company
                           in the wild
                           regions of the Rocky mountains, was the happiest time Horace Clifford had known for
                           many long years.
                           They sat around the camp-fire. Adelaide rested her head on her husband's shoulder,
                           and slept with a
                           thankful heart and trusting confidence, believing that the overruling power of God
                           was able to lead
                           them to a peaceful haven of rest. Horace sat clasping the hand of Joe, and pouring
                           eager questions
                           into his ears, asking of Austria and her life, saying: 
                           <said id="d196929e6306" who="#hclifford">"Tell me of my beloved
                              wife. I have never ceased to look for her, and regret the mad act that drove her from
                              my
                              presence. Oh, when can I see her once more? I will plead on my knees for her forgiveness.
                              She
                              will—she must—pardon me."

                        <p id="d196929e6309">It was a pleasure to Dr Throop to witness the happiness in his friend's behavior.
                           He was so happy to
                           hear from Austria; he would talk for a few moments to his son, telling him of his
                           desolate life, of
                           his weary wanderings up and down the the earth seeking his lost wife, and then for
                           a moment he would
                           pause, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e6311" who="#fthroop">"God grant she may be living yet. If long years of repentance
                              and remorse can atone for my sin, then I shall receive forgiveness. Oh, Austria! my
                              wife, my
                              darling! How you must have suffered through all the dreary <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="236" data-tei-n="231"> </a></span>
                              years of your life; but you shall never toil or suffer again if God permits me to
                              find
                              you."

                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6316">Joe could not cherish hatred in his heart for his father, when he saw him so broken
                           in spirits and
                           health.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6319">The morning dawned at last, and they resumed their journey at the first gleam of day,
                           fearful the
                           robbers would return with a stronger force and kill all of them. Their course lay
                           along the bank of
                           a beautiful stream of water which came tearing down through a dark canon from its
                           fountain-head in
                           the mountain side, and flowed on over beds of snow which had never felt the sun's
                           warm rays, down to
                           beautiful grassy plats where fragrant flowers bloomed in rich luxuriance. The trail
                           now became a
                           well beaten path. They traveled on until near sunset through this glorious country,
                           stopping at
                           times for a few moments to admire the grandest scenery ever painted by the master
                           hand of the
                           universe. At every step the scene became more enchanting. At length a sudden turn
                           in the path
                           brought them in view of the beautiful home of Clement Howe. Eagle's Eyrie was perched
                           away up on the
                           mountain side; the dying rays of the setting sun lighted up the gleaming marble front,
                           with its low,
                           French windows of glittering plate glass. It was a picture gorgeous to behold; away
                           to the north
                           rose the snow clad range of the Rocky mountains, seeking to pierce the skies with
                           their frozen peaks
                           of eternal snow; down the mountain side were many large, drooping, feathery pines,
                           sighing ever a
                           wild threnody of music.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6323">Our party paused, entranced, enraptured, at the beauty displayed by the taste of man,
                           working in such
                           complete harmony with the majestic grandeur of nature. That large and elegant mansion,
                           that was
                           founded on solid rock and fitted up with so much taste and luxury, seemed to have
                           grown there <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="237" data-tei-n="232"> </a></span> in nature, so perfect were all its surroundings, and so elaborate
                           was its architecture. The party surmised and wondered; some one thing, some another;
                           one suggested
                           the mansion to be the home of a foreign prince in exile; another that it was the wild
                           whim of some
                           rich man's brain that craved the solitude of a mountain home. They determined to seek
                           the entrance
                           to the grounds and implore rest for the night. It was dusk by the time they arrived
                           at the
                           entrance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6328">Dr. Throop rang the bell a hearty peal, that brought Marinda flying to the door. She
                           was considerably
                           nonplussed to behold a company of four men and one woman, desiring admission and accommodation
                           for
                           the night. She courtesied deeply, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e6330" who="#marinda">
                              <hi id="d196929e6331" style="; ">"Deed, gemmen,

                                 or

                        <p id="d196929e6334">Soon Clement came to the door and invited the company to enter. They were surprised
                           at the luxury and
                           magnificence displayed in that home, and felt almost as if they had entered fairy
                           land. Clement led
                           the way to the back parlor, which was warmed and lighted. He invited them to be seated,
                           and waited
                           for them to make themselves known.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6337">Dr. Throop informed him, in a few well chosen words, of their journey through the
                           mountains; of their
                           encounter with the mountain robbers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6340">This was sufficient excuse for them. Clement excused himself a moment, went to an
                           adjacent room,
                           called his servants by a bell, ordered the best rooms made ready for the guests, and
                           an excellent
                           supper prepared.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6343">Hope and Marinda immediately set about preparing a tempting supper. Silas lighted
                           the fire, which was
                           all the preparation the rooms needed, as they were kept well aired each day by the
                           strict attention
                           of Hope and Marinda.

                        <p id="d196929e6347">Clement returned to the parlor and entertained his guests. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="238" data-tei-n="233"> </a></span> with
                           pleasant conversation, until Silas entered the room with a respectful bow, and announced
                           that the
                           apartments were ready. They were then shown to their rooms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6352">Dr. Throop and his wife occupied the room lately occupied by Georgie Kent. Horace
                           and Joe had a room
                           together, and Mr. Brown one by himself. Here, with bright fires, fresh water, combs
                           and brushes,
                           they soon made themselves presentable. The bell soon summoned them to the supper table,
                           which was
                           spread with all manner of good things, in the elegant dining room at Eagle's Eyrie.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6355">Clement was the most generous host in existence. He urged his guests to partake of
                           the danties spread
                           before them until they had eaten their fill.

                        <p id="d196929e6358">After supper they gathered around the parlor fire to relate their adventures. Horace
                           Clifford was the
                           only one ill at ease; now that he had found his son he longed with such intense feeling
                           to see his
                           beloved wife.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6361">Dr. Throop and Adelaide were perfectly happy. Joe was in a measure contented; his
                           trip west had been
                           crowned with success beyond his highest anticipations. He had set out for the west
                           in April, an
                           object of charity, aided by those generous-hearted gentlemen who had requested Mr.
                           Whitelaw Reid to
                           accept their money and use it for charitable purposes. He was now returning with money
                           that would
                           enable him to enter business and build up a name and fortune; his mother's name would
                           be cleared
                           from the stigma she had borne for many years, and peace and plenty would be hers,
                           crowned with her
                           husband's tender love. He believed she would forgive his father and be happy. His
                           thoughts dwelt on
                           the many years of hardship she had undergone, and he longed, with a child's tender
                           devotion, for his
                           mother to be happy. While he sat thinking, his mind reverted to the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="239" data-tei-n="234"> </a></span> boys who came out west with him. He had lost sight of them at Parsons, Kansas, and
                           had never
                           heard a word from any of them. He thought of George Kent, and the memory of George's
                           heart-broken
                           look haunted him. He recalled the look of entreaty in George's eyes, which said so
                           plainly, do not
                           forsake me. A strange influence seemed to hover over him in regard to George, and
                           he sat seriously
                           thinking of the delicate boy.

                           tender love for
                           poor little friendless Georgie Kent. One was the strong tie of relationship, an uncle's

                           the other the purest, holiest, truest, love that ever warmed a man's heart, the love

                           of May, 1879, that swept with such terrific fury over northern Kansas; his near approach
                           to death
                           and his wonderful preservation by Georgie; his life after he had brought him to Colorado;
                           Georgie's
                           terrible ride upon Fleetfoot; the attempted assassination of himself which was prevented
                           by Georgie
                           at the risk of her life, and which revealed the secret of her sex which had been so
                           strictly guarded
                           up to that time; of Georgie's recovery; of her relating all she knew of her life;
                           of her pitiful
                           little struggling hands toiling for her bread in New York; of her life of terror for
                           fear she would
                           be discovered; of her reluctance to leave him and go to school. While he talked each
                           one of the
                           company seemed spell-bound, and when he had finished there was not a dry eye in the
                           room. Hot tears
                           crept down Adelaide's cheeks while Dr. Throop would ejaculate at intervals, 
                           <said id="d196929e6437" who="#fthroop">"Thank heaven for that child's preservation. I had dreaded so many unpleasant things

                              Oh, what did I not fear when I knew she was a little girl adrift upon the mighty current
                              of
                              humanity, homeless and friendless; but the God of the friendless has mercifully preserved
                              her
                              from a fate that is worse than death."

                        <p id="d196929e6440">Clement told them she was now in Denver City at a celebrated Female Academy of learning,
                           where she
                           was to remain two years, and when she had completed her education she was to become
                           his wife. He
                           told them of her beauty, of her rare musical talent and the interest she had manifested
                           in her
                           studies. He said, "I was a man alone in life with every hope in heart crushed and
                           my faith in woman
                           kind ruined. I shunned the marts of civilization so that I should never <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="242" data-tei-n="237"> </a></span> meet with woman. Providence threw her across my path, and unknown she
                           enlisted every sympathy in my heart by her noble conduct and pure, sinless ways. She
                           bound me to her
                           with a thousand nameless charms and I longed to make her my wife and keep her here
                           forever. She
                           rekindled the beacon fires of hope on the desolate altar of despair in my life and
                           made me a better,
                           more forgiving man. I would not take advantage of her youth and inexperience and bind
                           her to me by
                           irrevocable vows. I determined she should become accomplished and educated in the
                           ways of the world,
                           then if she chose a younger lover I would bind up her image in my desolate heart and
                           yield her up as
                           best I could, knowing that whatever she did it would be at the honest conviction of
                           her own pure
                           heart.

                           and
                           admiration. They understood how it was that a noble nature like his could lose faith
                           in woman and
                           become a wreck. Dr. Throop recalled the time when he for a moment doubted his Adelaide's
                           truth, and
                           his heart trembled with sorrow when he realized what his life would have been had
                           she betrayed him.
                           Horace Clifford recalled the seventeen long years of his life, and he saw again the
                           towering form,
                           the gleaming eyes, quivering nostrils, and heard again the deadly curse as it came
                           from the stern
                           lips of his wronged and tortured wife. She had sent scathing, burning words to his
                           heart when she
                           said, 
                           <said id="d196929e6447" who="#abclifford">"Curse you for a wretch and a fiend."</said> He felt that he deserved
                           that curse with all its deadly meaning, and he resolved to kneel at her feet and plead
                           for pardon
                           until she forgave him.

                        <p id="d196929e6451">Oh, how betrayed human hearts will cry out in their agony and grow reckless in their

                           The company were too excited to think or sleep; the hour had grown late unnoticed,
                           amid so many
                           exciting thoughts and rehearsals. The little ormolu clock on the mantel-piece tolled
                           out the
                           midnight hour, and Aunt Hope entered with a waiter full of night lamps, deposited
                           them on the side
                           table, and departed. This recalled Clement to his duties as host, and he immediately
                           inquired if
                           they wished to retire. They signified their willingness to do so. Horace was anxious
                           to be on his
                           way to New York city to seek his wife. Dr. Throop was impatient to see Georgie Kent
                           and take her to
                           his elegant home in New York. Mr. Brown was anxious to return to his farm in Kansas,
                           where he could
                           see his wife and little ones, and invest his newly-found fortune. Joe and Mr. Brown
                           did not like to
                           leave their money in the cave, but they felt almost certain it would not be discovered,
                           and Joe was
                           so anxious to see his mother. His father would not listen to returning for his money,
                           saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e6455" who="#hclifford">"My son, I have ample wealth for us both. All I want upon this earth is to be
                              permitted to meet my beloved wife and hear her words of forgiveness."

                        <p id="d196929e6458">When they had retired to their rooms for the night, Clement returned to the parlor,
                           where he had
                           spent so many pleasant evenings with Georgie. His heart was very heavy to-night; he
                           felt he would
                           have to be parted from his darling; he knew Dr. Throop would take her on East, and
                           he almost wished
                           he had listened to her childish entreaties and made her his wife. Then he would have
                           had the power
                           to keep her. But such a thought was unworthy of him; he banished it almost instantly,
                           and determined
                           to abide by her decision. He felt he had done right and acted the part of a gentleman
                           by her, and he
                           believed she truly loved him <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="244" data-tei-n="239"> </a></span> now, whatever she might do when
                           brought in contact with younger and better-looking men. Foolish man! If he could have
                           seen little
                           Georgie as she crept to bed that night, with his picture in her little dimpled hand,
                           and heard the
                           whispered words of love from her innocent lips as she kissed the noble face, he would
                           not have
                           doubted her love for him. She soon sank to sleep with the picture of her lover clasped
                           close in her
                           hand, her little patient face was beautiful as an angel in its sleeping trust of him
                           she loved with
                           all a maiden's first fond love. But he knew not of this. He sat alone, while all the
                           household was
                           wrapped in slumber, and listened to the wild wailings of the autumn wind, as it came
                           tearing down
                           the mountain side, with icy coldness in its breath. He felt that it would be like
                           tearing
                           heart-strings asunder to take her from him, and he bowed his stately head upon his
                           hands and the hot
                           tears trickled through the white fingers, and he sobbed, 
                           <said id="d196929e6462" who="#chowe">"My God, spare her to
                              me. Life will be so lonely, so cold, so desolate to me without my little Georgie."
                           </said> After
                           a time this strong man's agony subsided; he grew calm, but there was a dreary sadness
                           in his blue
                           eyes that showed an undertone of sorrow in his heart.

                        <p id="d196929e6467">Next morning dawned bright and clear. The men servants kindled fires in the rooms.
                           Hope and Marinda
                           prepared a delicious breakfast of fresh biscuit, tender venison steak, fried chicken,
                           fresh eggs,
                           fragrant coffee, with a dessert of jellies and preserved fruits. This breakfast was
                           heartily
                           relished by the guests, who complimented Clement on his good cooks, his beautiful
                           home and elegant
                           surroundings in every respect. Clement extended to them a cordial invitation to continue
                           their visit
                           to an indefinite length of time, telling them he would be delighted to entertain them
                           as guests
                           during the winter. Horace and Joe plead the <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="245" data-tei-n="240"> </a></span> necessity of their
                           immediate return to New York. Dr. Throop and Adelaide felt their homes could not longer
                           be
                           neglected, but they all promised at some future time to return and spend the summer
                           in the beautiful
                           home of Clement, Eagle's Eyrie. After breakfast the horses were saddled and brought
                           out, and the
                           company set out upon their journey to Leadville, intending to continue their way on
                           horseback until
                           they arrived at the nearest station that would take them to Denver. The men were well
                           armed; the
                           country at that time was in a terrible uproar. The Ute Indians had left their reservation,
                           and were
                           scouring the country in savage hordes, burning, killing, and destroying everything
                           that fell in
                           their way. Mr. Meeker, the Indian agent, had been killed. Major Thornburgh started
                           to rescue the
                           pioneer families near the reservation. He, with quite a number of men, had been murdered.
                           There was
                           need of our party being well armed, as they did not know who they might encounter
                           e'er they arrived
                           at the railroad station. Fortunately they were not disturbed, and in two days from
                           the time they
                           left Eagle's Eyrie they were aboard the cars and en route for Denver city, where they
                           arrived late
                           in November. Georgie was greatly surprised when she was called to the parlor to meet
                           friends, as she
                           did not expect Clement until Christmas, and not then if the mountain snow-storms had
                           been severe, as
                           the mountain roads often became impassable during the winter season.

                        <p id="d196929e6503">Georgie was all unconscious of the surprise in store for her. She entered the parlor
                           and saw many
                           strange faces; but one dear familiar face amid the crowd greeted her eyes, and with
                           a glad cry of
                           joy she sprang forward, clasping Clement's outstretched hands, saying,

                           tale her lips gave utterance to. He folded her in his arms for a moment, pressed a
                           kiss upon her
                           pure, white brow, and said,

                           simplicity
                           and thanked him for his kindness in protecting her from the insults of Bill Johnson

                           knew that Clement
                           was in every respect a noble, true-hearted man and one worthy of his <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="248" data-tei-n="243"> </a></span> niece's affection. But he did not feel like leaving her out here alone,
                           now that he had found her, and he said, 
                           <said id="d196929e6554" who="#chowe">"Georgie, there is only one way I will be
                              satisfied to leave you out here, and that is as the wife of Clement Howe."

                        <p id="d196929e6557">She replied, while a blush mantled her face, 
                           <said id="d196929e6559" who="#gkent">"But, uncle, it is not time for us to
                              be married yet; I have not finished my education."

                        <p id="d196929e6562">Here an idea occurred to Clement and he added, 
                           <said id="d196929e6564" who="#chowe">"What is to hinder us from being
                              married while your uncle and his friends are here, and you can remain at school until
                              spring,
                              and then I can take you to our home at Eagle's Eyrie."
                           </said>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6567">This seemed to be the only way her uncle would consent to leave her. They decided
                           for the wedding to
                           take place that evening at church. Clement pressed a well filled purse into Georgie's
                           hand, saying,
                           
                           <said id="d196929e6569" who="#chowe">"Make yourself look sweet, my darling, for your old bridegroom."</said>

                        <p id="d196929e6572">He was only thirty-six, and looked much younger; but he felt he looked old beside
                           his blooming

                        <p id="d196929e6579">Adelaide and Georgie went out shopping, accompanied by Dr. Throop and Clement. Horace
                           and Joe went to
                           tale a view of the city of Denver, and when evening came, Clement and Georgie were
                           quietly married
                           at the elegant hotel at which they were stopping. Georgie was elegantly attired in
                           white satin, with
                           a wreath of orange blossoms upon her childish brow. Her little face wore a grave and
                           womanly look.
                           She was happy beyond all expression; she knew she would not be separated from Clement
                           for long at a
                           time. Her faith in him was perfect. She had loved him with a strange, unaccountable
                           love ever since
                           she had held up the beautiful face and shapely head from drowning out in the wild
                           storm on the
                           plains of Kansas. Her childish affection had grown into a sweet womanly love that
                           could find no
                           happiness <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="249" data-tei-n="244"> </a></span> save in the presence of her loved one. And now she felt
                           her life's happiness was to be consummated; she was to be the wife of the only man
                           she loved on
                           earth.

                        <p id="d196929e6584">Clement did not claim his child wife with a husband's right. He preferred she should
                           have rooms of
                           her own at the hotel while her friends remained in Denver, and when they started east
                           she would go
                           back to school to remain until spring, while he returned to his home. He intended
                           to take her home
                           in the spring. She acted like a perfect little lady. She bade her aunt and uncle a
                           pleasant good-by,
                           and when her parting came with Clement, she kissed him with sweet gravity, and bade
                           him be careful
                           about robbers. She had always feared something would happen to him.

                           flaming mouth and
                           leaving flying sparks glinting along its track, it sped not fast enough for Horace
                           Clifford. He had
                           found his son, and the one wild cry of his heart was to find his wronged and suffering
                           wife. He now
                           felt that his son would intercede for him. When they reached the city of New York
                           his impatience
                           grew until he was almost maniacal in his conduct. He would clasp his hands to his
                           head and moan out
                           words like these,

                        <p id="d196929e6630">Dr. Throop talked consolingly to the distressed man; indeed, he feared for his reason
                           if Austria
                           should be dead. He saw Horace was wrought to a pitch of excitement little short of
                           insanity. He
                           said,

                              You have found your noble son; I have found my little niece. God has been very good
                              to us, not
                              only through the past few months of our existence, but all through our lives, and

                              Horace; we will proceed to the head of the police department and set Detective Sharp
                              in search
                              of your wife if she has changed her place of residence since Joe left. We will advertise

                           </said> saying this

                        <p id="d196929e6639">At last they were at their journey's end. They proceeded to a hotel until they could
                           get possession
                           of their houses. The doctor's house was a substantial brown stone house, with a delightful
                           home look
                           of comfort about it. This home he was soon to occupy with his darling wife, as soon
                           as the family
                           could remove who had occupied it while he was away. Horace had a beautiful palace
                           home of gleaming
                           white marble, glowing plate glass windows, and everything that art and taste combined
                           could render
                           elegant. This beautiful home had been naught but a source of sorrow to him. He felt
                           he had done
                           Austria an injustice by never taking her to this home in the first days of their wedded
                           life. He
                           resolved, as soon as she could be found, to remove here and spend his declining years
                           in the sweet
                           companionship of his beloved wife and son.

                        <p id="d196929e6642">Joe and Horace went immediately to the tenement rooms, where Austria and Mary had
                           lived when Joe went
                           west; but, as the reader already knows, Mary had been married to Mr <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="252" data-tei-n="247"> </a></span> Parke and Austria made her home with them in their stately home on Fifth avenue.
                           Here Austria had
                           lived, working with as much diligence as she had worked in the humble tenement house
                           in the days
                           gone by of her most abject poverty. She had become successful as an authoress; her
                           works had been
                           eagerly sought after by the reading public, and she had devoted herself assiduously
                           to writing.
                           Often in the dead hour of night, while the hum and roar in the busy city grew less
                           distinct, she sat
                           and wrote burning, thrilling words that found an echo in many a poor, tried and tempted
                           soul. She
                           had grown to look upon Horace Clifford as the quintessence of baseness personified;
                           her proud heart
                           scorned the man that could lure a woman to her ruin by his damnable treachery, then
                           betray and taunt
                           her with the disgrace of not being his wife. There was little forgiveness in Austria
                           Clifford's
                           proud heart for a wrong such as had been done her. She tried always to think of Horace
                           with loathing
                           and contempt, yet there were times in her life when her woman's heart cried out in
                           agony and
                           despair, when she longed with all the power of a deep, strong nature like hers to
                           see her husband
                           and be with him as she was in the sweet days of halcyon contentment, e'er the hideous
                           monster of
                           intemperance had entered their little Eden and drove her forth from its blissful enjoyment.
                           She
                           recalled the many happy hours they had spent together, and she blushed, after seventeen
                           long, long
                           years of poverty and hardship had been endured, when she thought of his gladness,
                           his praise of her,
                           when he first knew she was to become a mother. He had folded his arms around her,
                           and said so
                           tenderly, 
                           <said id="d196929e6646" who="#hclifford">"Austria, darling, I am the proudest, happiest man in New York city
                              to-day; be careful of yourself, my precious one."
                           </said> And but a few short months of time had
                           told their length until he had driven her <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="253" data-tei-n="248"> </a></span> forth in drunken fury
                           and disowned her as his wife. Austria did not know it was the mad raving of the devil
                           of
                           intoxication that had turned her darling husband to a hideous monster that had driven
                           her out in the
                           cruel world, a homeless, friendless creature. Had she known his talk was the wild
                           raving of
                           drunkenness, she would have been more forgiving; but she thought he had married her
                           in an hour of
                           infatuation with her, had tired of her and wished to be rid of her. She believed he
                           had a living
                           wife, and the knowledge of his perfidy drove her to desperation, and in the frantic
                           agony of that
                           moment she had cursed him with a deep and lasting curse and gone out from his presence,
                           as she
                           believed, forever. She sat here alone, in a beautiful room, furnished in elegant style.
                           It was late
                           on the night following Horace and Joe's arrival in New York. She was dressed in a
                           black dress of
                           some rich material; her beautiful face wore a look of deep unrest; she was anxious
                           about her son;
                           she had not heard a word from him since his arrival in Leadville, in June, and now
                           it was growing
                           late in November. She had not expected many letters, but to-night her heart ached
                           with a feeling of
                           vague unrest, and her beautiful blue eyes wore a look of deeper pain than usual. She
                           felt that
                           something was about to occur that would bring either great joy or great sorrow to
                           her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6652">It had grown to a habit with Austria while she was laboring under deep mental anxiety
                           to write, and
                           to-night she grasped a pencil and wrote rapid, glowing words. She took no note of
                           time, but at last,
                           worn out with writing, she pushed aside the manuscript and sat with clasped hands,
                           thinking of her
                           son. From her son her mind drifted to her husband, and for the first time since she
                           had left him in
                           anger seventeen years ago, she determined to try to seek him out and know what had
                           become of him.
                           She thought she could stand to know it if he was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="254" data-tei-n="259"> </a></span> another woman's
                           husband, the father of another's children. There is no thought in nature so bitter
                           to a woman's
                           heart as the thought that she has been deliberately betrayed; that her husband is
                           a vile wretch and
                           had another wife ere he wedded her. This thought had burned in Austria's brain until
                           she almost
                           hated the name of man. But though her mood had changed;, she felt that she would like
                           to look upon
                           Horace once more. She little knew he was at that moment pacing his room at the hotel
                           and crying out
                           to himself, 
                           <said id="d196929e6656" who="#hclifford">"Oh, she is dead, dead, and I shall never see her any more, or
                              hear her words of pardon for my abuse of her. Oh, God, I can not stand this, it is
                              driving me
                              wild."
                           </said>

                        <p id="d196929e6659">Horace and Joe had found the tenement house, but no trace of Austria could be found.
                           The people in
                           that house were transient movers. Indeed the rooms formerly occupied by Mary and Austria
                           had had
                           many different occupants since they had lived there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6662">Joe's heart sank with despair when he realized his mother was gone. The steel blue
                           eyes took on a
                           look of deep, soul suffering, too deep for expression. He had no words of comfort
                           to offer when his
                           father smote his forehead with his hands, and cried:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6665">
                           
                           <said id="d196929e6667" who="#hclifford">"Oh, my beloved Austria; she is dead, dead!"</said>
                           
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6672">Man and boy, father and son, suffered together. Joe did not reproach his father and
                           say it is your
                           fault, but his face showed deep and heartfelt anguish. They made inquiries but could
                           find no trace
                           of Austria. They now returned to the hotel to consult with Dr. Throop. The doctor
                           advised them to
                           employ the police and also to insert advertisements in the daily papers. They immediately
                           set about
                           doing this, and when all had been done that could be done they returned to the hotel
                           to wait until
                           morning.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d196929e6677">Joe sat by the window in silence, thinking what a change had come over him since he
                           had left New
                           York, a few short months ago. Then he was a homeless, nameless boy, without friends
                           or money, an
                           object of charity; assisted by the noble-hearted generosity of some unknown persons
                           he had started
                           to the far west. Now he had returned with wealth at his command as the fondly cherished
                           son of a
                           father who was proud to claim him for his own and longed to surround him with all
                           the wealth and
                           honor he could bestow. But he had lost what he had prized more than wealth, fame and
                           honor—it was
                           his darling mother—she who had tended him in his infancy, who had toiled through long
                           years to help
                           him on in the world, and now she was gone and her fate wrapped in uncertainty.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6680">It required all the power that steady, honest Joe possessed to maintain his self-control
                           in this
                           trying hour. His heart was throbbing furiously, and his lips were dry and parched
                           with an inward
                           burning. He pitied his father, for he believed him to be truly repentant, but he could
                           offer him no
                           consolation in this dark night of his affliction. They were sufferers together. Joe
                           was suffering
                           for a parent's wrong; the torture was none the less intense to him because he was
                           in no way to blame
                           for their present suffering; the innocent oftimes suffer for the guilty, and he was
                           bearing his
                           share manfully. The night dragged wearily on, and when midnight came Joe said, kindly:
                           
                           <said id="d196929e6682" who="#jclifford">"Father, you had better lie down and rest; I hope we will hear something in the

                        <p id="d196929e6698">Thus soothed and consoled to some extent by his son's kind entreaties, Horace sought
                           his bed, but not
                           to sleep, and when the first gleam of morning light broke over the city he was up,
                           restless and
                           impatient as ever. He had really worn himself into a mania of distress by his constant
                           thinking. He
                           could not taste food. He drank a cup of strong coffee, and set out to the police department
                           to learn
                           if they had discovered any trace of her. He learned that two women answering the description
                           of Mary
                           and Austria had left the tenement house in company with Mr. Parke, and one of them
                           had become his
                           wife. Here was a fresh source of sorrow for Horace. What if Austria, driven to believe
                           he had cast
                           her off, had married again! He moaned out in his anguish,

                              man's wife! Oh, I want to die!"
                           </said> But Joe instantly assured him, saying, 
                           <said id="d196929e6703" who="#jclifford">"I feel it is Aunt Mary that is married—not my mother."</said>

                        <p id="d196929e6709">They took a carriage and drove immediately to Mr. Parke's stately residence, which

                           the first item that caught Austria's eye was the advertisement making inquiries for
                           herself. When
                           they had finished breakfast and repaired to the parlor to discuss more particularly
                           the

                           announced by the pompous waiter at Parkhurst.

                        <p id="d196929e6717">Austria sprang to her feet, a glad cry of joy on her lips, and soon had her son clasped
                           in her arms.
                           Austria, in her gladness, had not observed Horace, who had entered unobserved, and
                           had witnessed the

                           wrought a sad change in Horace; but the eyes of love recognized, in that sad face

                        <p id="d196929e6850">Clement made all necessary arrangements to leave home until April. There were plenty
                           of provisions
                           laid in for the servants; he left orders for the horses to be well cared for and set
                           out on his
                           journey a week before Christmas, so he could be in Denver at the opening of the holidays.
                           He arrived
                           in safety, and hastened to meet his sweet young bride. There was no sham acting on
                           the part of
                           Georgie; she truly and devotedly loved her dear husband, and found no pleasure in
                           life save in his
                           presence. She had studied hard and improved rapidly. She had also developed very rapidly;
                           the
                           healthy, bracing air of the west had helped her in every way. Since her marriage she
                           had employed a
                           dressmaker, who had lengthened out her dresses, and the dainty little form swept regally
                           into the
                           presence of her husband; but when she discovered who it was, her manner changed in
                           an instant, and
                           she was clinging to him, kissing him, and crying out,

                        <p id="d196929e6863">Clement took rooms at the Metropolitan in Denver, and every evening when school was
                           out he took
                           Georgie out to some place of amusement. Together they visited all the places of interest,
                           and when
                           spring came she was still his child bride. He had never taken her to his rooms or
                           claimed a
                           husband's privilege of entering her's. He was anxious for spring to come so he could
                           take her to
                           their beautiful home in the mountains, and she was also anxious to return to Eagle's
                           Eyrie.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d196929e6866">Spring came at last and they returned to their home, gladly welcomed by their servants.
                           They sent
                           invitations to their friends in New York to come west and spend the summer with them.
                           Eagle's Eyrie
                           was a delightful resort for a summer residence. Dr. Throop and his wife, Horace Clifford
                           and his
                           wife and son, and Mr. and Mrs. Elliot and Birdie, all accepted the invitation. Mrs.
                           Parke could not
                           go, as she was the happy mother of the future heir of Parkhurst and Mr. Parke was
                           the happiest
                           father in New York; he now had a son and heir to perpetuate his name and inherit his
                           vast
                           wealth.

                        <p id="d196929e6869">Time sped on and a few years brought many changes. Georgie made a loving wife and
                           mother; Clement
                           lost every vestige of his old time hatred for women, and was the kindest, most devoted
                           husband in
                           existence.
