                        <p id="d145581e322">It was in the summer of 1805 that the design of writing
                           this biography was first conceived. It was produced by
                           an incident of feeling, which however it affected the author
                           at the time, might now, be thought light and trivial
                           by the reader, and he shall not therefore, be detained
                           by the recital of it. The author knew nothing
                           of Mr. Henry, personally. He had never seen him;
                           and was of course, compelled to rely wholly on the
                           information of others. As soon, therefore, as the design
                           was formed of writing his life, aware of the necessity of
                           losing no time, in collecting, from the few remaining coevals
                           of Mr. Henry, that personal knowledge of the
                           subject which might erelong be expected to die with
                           them, the author despatched letters to every quarter of
                           the state in which it occurred to him as probable, that
                           interesting matter might be found; and he was gratified
                           by the prompt attention which was paid to his inquiries.
                        </p>
                        <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e325"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="4" data-tei-n="vi"> </a></span>
                        
                        <p id="d145581e327">There were at that time, living in the county of Hanover,
                           three gentlemen of the first respectability, who
                           had been the companions of Mr. Henry's childhood and
                           youth: these were, col. Charles Dabney, capt. George
                           Dabney, and col. William O. Winston; the two first of
                           whom are still living. Not having the pleasure of a
                           personal acquaintance with these gentlemen, the author
                           interested the late Mr. Nathaniel Pope in his object,
                           and by his instrumentality, procured all the useful
                           information which was in their possession. Mr. Pope is
                           well known to have been a gentleman of uncommonly
                           vigorous and discriminating mind; a sacred observer of
                           truth, and a man of the purest sense of honour. The
                           author cannot recall the memory of this most amiable
                           and excellent man, to whom (if there be any merit in
                           this work) the friends of Mr. Henry and the state of Virginia
                           owe so many obligations, without paying to that
                           revered memory, the tribute of his respect and affection.
                           Mr. Pope was one of those ardent young Virginians,
                           who embarked, before they had attained their maturity, in
                           the cause of the American revolution: he joined an animated
                           and active corps of horse, and signalized himself
                           by an impetuous gallantry, which drew upon him the
                           eyes and the applause of his commander. In peace, he
                           was as mild as he had been brave in war; his bosom
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e329"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="5" data-tei-n="vii"> </a></span>
                           was replete with the kindest affections; he was in
                           truth, one of the best of companions, and one of the
                           warmest of friends. The fact, that he was the acknowledged
                           head of the several bars at which he practised
                           in the country, may assure the reader of his capacity
                           for the commission which he so cheerfully undertook, in
                           regard to Mr. Henry; and the unblemished integrity of
                           his life may assure him also, of the fidelity with which
                           that commission was executed. So many important
                           anecdotes in the following work, depend on the credit
                           of this gentleman as a witness, that the slight sketch
                           which has been given of his character will not, it is
                           hoped, be thought foreign to the purpose of this preface.
                           Mr. Pope did not confine his inquiries to the
                           county of Hanover: he was indefatigable in collecting
                           information from every quarter; which he never accepted
                           however, but from the purest sources; and his
                           authority for every incident was given, with the most
                           scrupulous accuracy. The author had hoped to have
                           had it in his power to gratify this gentleman by submitting
                           to his view the joint result of their labours, and
                           obtaining the benefit of his last corrections; but he was
                           disappointed by his untimely and melancholy death.
                           He fell a victim to that savage practice, which under
                           the false name of honour, continued to prevail too long;
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e331"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="viii"> </a></span>
                           and his death is believed to have been highly instrumental
                           in hastening that system of legislation in
                           restraint of this practice, which now exists in Virginia.

                           writer derived material aid from various other quarters.
                           The widow of Mr. Henry was still living, and had
                           intermarried with judge Winston: from this gentleman,
                           (who was also related to Mr. Henry by blood, and had
                           been intimately acquainted with him through the far
                           greater part of his life) the author received a succinct,
                           but extremely accurate and comprehensive memoir.

                           than Mr. Henry, had been raised in the same neighbourhood,
                           and had finally married one of his sisters.
                           Having known Mr. Henry, from his birth to his death,
                           he had it in his power to supply very copious details,
                           which were taken down from his narration by the present
                           judge Cabell, and forwarded to the author.

                           Mr. Henry, was the late judge Tyler. The judge had
                           a kind of Roman frankness and even bluntness in his
                           manners, together with a decision of character and a
                           benevolence of spirit, which had attached Mr. Henry to
                           him, from his first appearance on the public stage.
                           They were, for a long time, members of the house of

                           delegates together, and their friendship continued until
                           it was severed by death. From judge Tyler, the author
                           received a very minute and interesting communication
                           of incidents, the whole of which had either passed
                           in his own presence, or had been related to him by Mr.
                           Henry himself.

                           three of his best incidents; one of them will probably,
                           be pronounced the most interesting passage of the work.
                           He owes to the same gentleman too, the fullest and liveliest
                           description of the person of Mr. Henry, which has
                           been furnished from any quarter: and he stands farther

                           been made to him; and the vigour and elegance with
                           which that gentleman writes, has frequently enabled
                           the author, to relieve the dulness of his own narrative,

                           sketch which he had, himself, prepared of the life of
                           Mr. Henry; and he has, furthermore, availed himself

                           examine an extremely valuable manuscript history of

                           to the close of the American revolution; by these, he

                           and he owes them an explanation for having
                           done so: the explanation is this; their statements were,
                           in several instances, diametrically opposed to each
                           other; and were sometimes, all contradicted by the
                           public prints, or the records of the state. It ought not
                           to be matter of surprise that these contradictions should
                           exist, even among those most respectable gentlemen,
                           relying as they did, upon human memory merely; and
                           speaking of events so very remote, without a previous
                           opportunity of communicating with each other. It
                           will be seen by them, that the author has been obliged
                           in several instances, to contradict even the several
                           histories of the times, concerning which he writes: but this
                           he has never done, without the most decisive proofs of
                           his own correctness, which he has always cited: nor has
                           he ever departed from the narratives of his several
                           correspondents, except under the direction of preponderating
                           evidence. As among those contradictory statements,
                           
                           <hi id="d145581e374" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> could not be true, he has sought the correction by

                           public documents when such correction was attainable;
                           and when it was not, he has selected among his narrators,
                           those, whose opportunities to know the fact in
                           question, seemed to be the best. This he has done,
                           without the slightest intention to throw a shadow of
                           suspicion on the credit of any gentleman, who has been so
                           obliging as to answer his inquiries; but merely from the
                           necessity which he was under, either of making

                           and want of ability for such a work) he has
                           been compelled to write (when he was suffered to write
                           at all) amidst that incessant professional annoyance
                           which has been mentioned, and which is known by
                           every man, who has ever made the trial, to forbid the
                           hope of success in any composition of this extent. Could
                           the writer have looked forward, with any reasonable
                           calculation, to a period of greater ease, his respect for
                           the memory of Mr. Henry, as well as his regard for
                           himself would have induced him to suspend this undertaking,
                           until that period should have arrived. But having
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e397"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="xiv"> </a></span>
                           no ground for any hope of this kind, he has thought
                           it better to hazard even these crude sketches, than to
                           suffer the materials which he had accumulated with so
                           much toil, and for all object which he thought so laudable,
                           to perish on his hands.

                        <p id="d145581e400">These remarks are not made with the view of deprecating
                           the censures of critics by profession: but merely
                           to bespeak the candour of that larger portion of readers
                           who are willing to be pleased with the best efforts that
                           can be reasonably expected, from the circumstances of
                           the case. The author however, is well satisfied, that
                           the most indulgent reader (although benevolently
                           disposed to overlook defects of execution) will be certainly
                           disappointed 
                           <hi id="d145581e402" style="font-style: italic;">in the matter itself</hi>, of this work; for
                           notwithstanding all his exertions, he is entirely conscious
                           that the materials which he has been able to collect are
                           scanty and meagre, and utterly disproportionate to the
                           great fame of Mr. Henry. It is probable, that much of
                           what was once known of him, had perished before the
                           author commenced his researches; and it is very possible
                           that much may still be known, which he has not been
                           able to discover; because it lies in unsuspected sources,
                           or with persons unwilling for some reason or other to
                           communicate their information. It is the conviction that
                           he has not been able to inform himself of the whole
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e405"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="xv"> </a></span>
                           events of Mr. Henry's life, and that his collection can
                           be considered only as so many detached SKETCHES,
                           which has induced him to prefix this name to his book.
                           If, in this humble and unassuming character, it shall give
                           any pleasure to the numerous admirers of Mr. Henry,
                           in Virginia, the author will have attained all that he has
                           a right to expect.

                           <p id="d145581e436">PATRICK HENRY, the second son of John and
                              Sarah Henry, and one of nine children, was born on the
                              29th of May 1736, at the family seat, called Studley, in
                              the county of Hanover and colony of Virginia. In his
                              early childhood, his parents removed to another seat in
                              the same county, then called Mount Brilliant, now the
                              Retreat; at which latter place, Patrick Henry was raised
                              and educated. His parents, though not rich, were in
                              easy circumstances; and, in point of personal character,
                              were among the most respectable inhabitants of the colony.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e439">His father, col. John Henry, was a native of Aberdeen,
                              in Scotland. He was, it is said, a first cousin to David
                              Henry, who was the brother-in-law and successor of
                              Edward Cave, in the publication of that celebrated work,
                              The Gentleman's Magazine, and, himself, the author of
                              several literary tracts: John Henry, is, also said to have
                              been a nephew, in the maternal line, to the great historian
                              Dr. William Robertson. He came over to Virginia,
                              in quest of fortune, some time prior to the year 1730, and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e441"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span>
                              the tradition is, that he enjoyed the friendship and patronage
                              of Mr. Dinwiddie, afterwards the governor of the
                              colony. By this gentleman, it is reported, that he was
                              introduced to the elder col. Syme of Hanover, in whose
                              family, it is certain, that he became domesticated during
                              the life of that gentleman, after whose death, he
                              intermarried with his widow, and resided on the estate
                              which he had left. It is considered as a fair proof of the
                              personal merit of Mr. John Henry, that, in those days,
                              when offices were bestowed with peculiar caution, he
                              was the colonel of his regiment, the principal surveyor of
                              the county, and for many years, the presiding magistrate
                              of the county court. His surviving acquaintances concur
                              in stating, that he was a man of liberal education,
                              that he possessed a plain, yet solid understanding; and lived
                              long a life of the most irreproachable integrity, and
                              exemplary piety. His brother Patrick, a clergyman of the
                              church of Engand, followed him to this country some
                              years afterwards; and became, by 
                              <hi id="d145581e443" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> influence, the minister
                              of St. Paul's parish in Hanover, the functions of which
                              office he sustained throughout life with great respectability.
                              Both the brothers were zealous members of the
                              established church, and warmly attached to the reigning
                              family. Col. John Henry was conspicuously so: “there
                              are those yet alive,” says a correspondent,<a href="note1" class="ref-external" n="1" rend="sc"> *</a> “who have
                              seen him, at the head of his regiment, celebrating the

                              as his son Patrick, afterwards, displayed, in resisting the

                              and the mother of Patrick Henry, was a native of Hanover
                              County, and of the family of Winstons. She possessed,
                              in an eminent degree, the mild and benevolent
                              disposition, the undeviating probity, the correct
                              understanding and easy elocution by which that ancient family
                              has been so long distinguished. Her brother William,
                              the father of the present judge Winston, is said to have
                              been highly endowed with that peculiar cast of eloquence,
                              for which Mr. Henry became, afterwards, so
                              justly celebrated. Of this gentleman I have an anecdote
                              from a correspondent,<a href="note3" class="ref-external" n="3" rend="sc"> *</a> which I shall give in his
                              own words. “I have often heard my father, who was
                              intimately acquainted with this William Winston, say,
                              that he was the greatest orator whom he ever heard,
                              Patrick Henry excepted; that during the last French and
                              Indian war, and soon after Braddock's defeat, when the
                              militia were marched to the frontiers of Virginia, against
                              the enemy, this William Winston was the lieutenant of a
                              company; that the men, who were indifferently clothed,
                              without tents, and exposed to the rigour and inclemency of
                              the weather, discovered great aversion to the service, and
                              were anxious and even clamorous to return to their families;
                              when this William Winston, mounting a stump, (the
                              common

                              addressed them with such keenness of invective, and
                              declaimed with such force of eloquence, on liberty and
                              patriotism, that when he concluded, the general cry was,
                              ‘let us march on; lead us against the enemy;’ and they
                              were now willing, nay anxious to encounter all those
                              difficulties and dangers, which, but a few moments before,
                              had almost produced a mutiny.”

                              be thought quite sufficient, in relation to a man, who
                              owed no part of his greatness to the lustre of his pedigree,
                              but was, in truth, the sole founder of his own fortunes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e494">Until ten years of age, Patrick Henry was sent to
                              a school in the neighbourhood, where he learned to
                              read and write, and made some small prowess in arithmetic.
                              He was, then, taken home, and under the
                              direction of his father; who had opened a grammar
                              school in his own house, he acquired a superficial
                              knowledge of the Latin language; and learned to read
                              the character, but never to translate Greek. At the
                              same time, he made a considerable proficiency in the
                              mathematics, the only branch of education for which,
                              it seems, he discovered, in his youth, the slightest
                              predilection. But he was too idle to gain any solid advantage
                              from the opportunities which were thrown in his
                              way. He was passionately addicted to the sports of the
                              field, and could not support the confinement and toil
                              which education required. Hence, instead of system
                              or any semblance of regularity in his studies, his efforts
                              were always desultory, and became more and more
                              rare; until, at length, when the hour of his school
                              exercises arrived, Patrick was scarcely ever to be found.
                              He was in the forest with his gun, or over the brook
                              with his angle-rod; and, in these frivolous occupations,
                              when not controuled by the authority of his father,
                              (which was rarely exerted,) he would, it is said, spend
                              whole days and weeks, with an appetite rather whetted
                              than cloyed by enjoyment. His school fellows, having
                              observed his growing passion for those amusements, and
                              having remarked that its progress was not checked
                              either by the want of companions or the want of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e496"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="5"> </a></span>
                              success, have frequently watched his movements to discover,
                              if they could, the secret source of that delight which
                              they seemed to afford him. But they made no discovery
                              which led them to any other conclusion than (to
                              use their own expression) “that he loved idleness for
                              its own sake.” They have frequently observed him
                              laying along, under the shade of some tree that overhung
                              the sequestered stream, watching, for hours, at
                              the same spot, the motionless cork of his fishing line,
                              without one encouraging symptom of success, and without
                              any apparent source of enjoyment, unless he could
                              find it in the ease of his posture, or in the illusions of
                              hope, or, which is most probable, in the stillness of the
                              scene and the silent workings of his own imagination.
                              This love of solitude, in his youth, was often observed.
                              Even when hunting with a party, his choice was not to join
                              the noisy band that drove the deer; he preferred to
                              take his stand, alone, where he might wait for the passing
                              game, and indulge himself, meanwhile, in the luxury
                              of thinking. Not that he was averse to society; on the
                              contrary, he had, at times, a very high zest for it. But
                              even in society, his enjoyments while young, were of a
                              peculiar cast; he did not mix in the wild mirth of his
                              equals in age; but sat, quiet and demure, taking no part
                              in the conversation, giving no responsive smile to the
                              circulating jest, but lost, to all appearance, in silence
                              and abstraction. This abstraction, however, was only
                              apparent; for on the dispersion of a company, when
                              interrogated by his parents as to what had been passing,
                              he was able not only to detail the conversation, but to
                              sketch, with strict fidelity, the character of every
                              speaker. None of these early delineations of character
                              are retained by his contemporaries; and, indeed,
                              they are said to have been more remarkable for their
                              justness, than for any peculiar felicity of execution.

                           <p id="d145581e501">I cannot learn that he gave, in his youth, any evidence
                              of that precocity which sometimes distinguishes
                              uncommon genius. His companions recollect no
                              instance of premature wit, no striking sentiment, no flash
                              of fancy, no remarkable beauty or strength of
                              expression; find no indication, however slight, either of
                              that impassioned love of liberty, or of that adventurous
                              daring and intrepidity, which marked, so strongly, his
                              future character. So far was he, indeed, from exhibiting
                              any one prognostic of his greatness, that every
                              omen foretold a life, at best of mediocrity, if not of
                              insignificance. His person is represented as having been
                              coarse, his manners uncommonly awkward, his dress
                              slovenly, his conversation very plain, his aversion to study
                              invincible, and his faculties almost entirely benumbed by
                              indolence. No persuasion could bring him either to read
                              or to work. On the contrary, he ran wild in the forest,
                              like one of the 
                              <hi id="d145581e503" style="font-style: italic;">aborigines</hi> of the country, and divided
                              his life between the dissipation and uproar of the chase,
                              and the languor of inaction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e507">His propensity to observe and comment upon the
                              human character, was, so far as I can learn, the only
                              circumstance, which distinguished him, advantageously,
                              from his youthful companions. This propensity seems
                              to have been born with him, and to have exerted itself,
                              instinctively, the moment that a new subject was
                              presented to his view. Its action was incessant, and it
                              became, at length, almost the only intellectual exercise in
                              which he seemed to take delight. To this cause may
                              be traced that consummate knowledge of the human
                              heart which he finally attained, and which enabled him,
                              when he came upon the public stage, to touch the springs
                              of passion with a master-hand, and to controul the
                              resolutions and decisions of his hearers, with a power,
                              almost more than mortal.

                           <p id="d145581e512">From what has been already stated, it will be seen,
                              how little education had to do with the formation of this
                              great man's mind. He was, indeed, a mere child of
                              nature, and nature seems to have been too proud
                              and too jealous of her work, to permit it to be touched
                              by the hand of art. She gave him Shakespeare's
                              genius, and bade him, like Shakspeare, to depend on
                              that alone. Let not the youthful reader, however, deduce,
                              from the example of Mr. Henry, an argument in
                              favour of indolence and the contempt of study. Let
                              him remember that the powers which surmounted the
                              disadvantage of those early habits, were such as very
                              rarely appear upon this earth. Let him remember,
                              too, how long the genius, even of Mr. Henry, was kept
                              down and hidden from the public view, by the sorcery
                              of those pernicious habits; through what years of
                              poverty and wretchedness they doomed him to struggle;
                              and, let him remember; that at length, when in the
                              zenith of his glory, Mr. Henry himself, had frequent occasions
                              to deplore the consequences of his early neglect of
                              literature, and to bewail “the ghosts of his departed hours.”

                           <p id="d145581e516">His father, unable to sustain, with convenience, the
                              expense of so large a family as was now multiplying on
                              his hands, found it necessary to qualify his sons, at a
                              very early age, to support themselves. With this view,
                              Patrick was placed, at the age of fifteen, behind the
                              counter of a merchant in the country. How he
                              conducted himself in this situation, I have not been able to
                              learn. There could not, however, I presume, have
                              been any flagrant impropriety in his conduct, since, in
                              the next year, his father considered him qualified to
                              carry on business, on his own account. Under this
                              impression, he purchased a small adventure of goods for
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e518"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="8"> </a></span>
                              his two sons, William and Patrick, and, according to
                              the language of the country, “set them up in trade.”
                              William's habits of idleness were, if possible, still more
                              unfortunate than Patrick's. The chief management of
                              their concerns devolved, therefore, on the younger brother,
                              and that management seems to have been most wretched.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e521">Left to himself, all the indolence of his character
                              returned. Those unfortunate habits which he had formed,
                              and whose spell was already, too strong to be broken,
                              comported very poorly with that close attention,
                              that accuracy and persevering vigour, which are essential
                              to the merchant. The drudgery of retailing and of
                              book-keeping soon became intolerable; yet he was
                              obliged to preserve appearances by remaining,
                              continually, at his stand. Besides these unpropitious habits,
                              there was still another obstacle to his success, in the natural
                              kindness of his temper. “He could not find it in
                              his heart” to disappoint any one who came to him for
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e523" style="font-style: italic;">credit</hi>; and he was very easily satisfied by apologies for
                              non-payment. He condemned, in himself, this facility
                              of temper, and foresaw the embarrassments with which
                              it threatened him; but he was unable to overcome it.
                              Even with the best prospects, the confinement of such
                              a business would have been scarcely supportable; but
                              with those which now threatened him, his store
                              became a prison. To make the matter still worse, the
                              joys of the chase, joys now to him forbidden, echoed
                              around him every morning, and by their contrast, and
                              the longings which they excited, contributed to deepen
                              the disgust which he had taken to his employments.

                           <p id="d145581e527">From these painful reflections, and the gloomy forebodings
                              which darkened the future, he sought, at first,
                              a refuge in music, for which it seems he had a natural
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e529"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="22" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span>
                              taste, and he learned to play well on the violin and on
                              the flute. From music he passed to books, and, having
                              procured a few light and elegant authors, acquired, for
                              the first time, a relish for reading.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e532">He found another relief, too, in the frequent opportunities
                              now afforded him of pursuing his favourite study
                              of the human character. The character of every
                              customer underwent this scrutiny; and that, not with
                              reference either to the integrity or solvency of the individual,
                              in which one would suppose that Mr. Henry would feel
                              himself most interested; but in relation to the structure of
                              his mind, the general cast of his opinions, the motives
                              and principles which influenced his actions, and what
                              may be called the philosophy of character. In pursuing
                              these investigations, he is said to have resorted to arts,
                              apparently so far above his years, and which look so
                              much like an after-thought, resulting from his future
                              eminence, that I should hesitate to make the statement,
                              were it not attested by so many witnesses, and by some
                              who cannot be suspected of the capacity for having
                              fabricated the fact. Their account of it, then, is this; that
                              whenever a company of his customers met in the store,
                              (which frequently happened on the last day of the week)
                              and were, themselves, sufficiently gay and animated to
                              talk and act as nature prompted, without concealment,
                              without reserve, he would take no part in their discussions,
                              but listen with a silence as deep and attentive, as
                              if under the influence of some potent charm. If, on the
                              contrary, they were dull and silent, he would, without
                              betraying his drift, task himself to set them in motion,
                              and excite them to remark, collision, and exclamation.
                              He was peculiarly delighted with comparing their
                              characters, and ascertaining how they would, severally, act,
                              in given situations. With this view he would state an
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e534"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="10"> </a></span>
                              hypothetic case, and call for their opinions, one by one,
                              as to the conduct which would be proper in it. If they
                              differed, he would demand their reasons, and enjoy
                              highly, the debates in which he would thus involve
                              them. By multiplying and varying those imaginary
                              cases at pleasure, he ascertained the general course of
                              human opinion, and formed, for himself, as it were, a
                              graduated scale of the motives and conduct which are
                              natural to man. Sometimes he would entertain them
                              with stories, gathered from his reading, or, as was more
                              frequently the case, drawn from his own fancy, composed
                              of heterogeneous circumstances, calculated to excite,
                              by turns, pity, terror, resentment, indignation, contempt;
                              pausing, in the turns of his narrative, to observe
                              the effect; to watch the different modes in which the
                              passions expressed themselves, and learn the language
                              of emotion from those children of nature.

                           <p id="d145581e537">In these exercises, Mr. Henry could have had nothing
                              in view beyond the present gratification of a natural
                              propensity. The advantages of them, however,
                              were far more permanent, and gave the brightest colours
                              to his future life. For those continual efforts to render
                              himself intelligible to his plain and unlettered hearers,
                              on subjects entirely new to them, taught him that clear
                              and simple style which forms the best vehicle of thought
                              to a popular assembly; which his attempts to interest and
                              affect them, in order that he might hear from them the
                              echo of nature's voice, instructed him in those topics of
                              persuasion by which men were the most certainly to be
                              moved, and in the kind of imagery and structure of
                              language, which were the best fitted to strike and agitate
                              their hearts. These constituted his excellences as an
                              orator; and never was there a man, in any age, who
                              possessed, in a more eminent degree, the lucid and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e539"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="11"> </a></span>
                              nervous style of argument, the command of the most
                              beautiful and striking imagery, or that language of passion
                              which burns from soul to soul.

                              headlong, to its catastrophe. One year put an end
                              to it. William was then thrown loose upon society, to
                              which he was never, afterwards, usefully attached;<a href="note4" class="ref-external" n="4" rend="sc"> *</a> and

                              years, in winding up this disastrous experiment as well
                              as he could.

                           <p id="d145581e549">His misfortunes, however, seem not to have had the
                              effect either of teaching him prudence or of chilling his
                              affections. For, at the early age of eighteen, we find
                              him married to a miss Shelton, the daughter of an honest
                              farmer in the neighbourhood, but in circumstances too
                              poor to contribute effectually to her support. By the
                              joint assistance of their parents, however, the young
                              couple were settled on a small farm, and, here, with the
                              assistance of one or two slaves, Mr. Henry had to delve
                              the earth, with his own hands, for subsistence. Such
                              are the vicissitudes of human life! It is curious to
                              contemplate this giant genius, destined in a few years to
                              guide the councils of a mighty nation, but unconscious
                              of the intellectual treasures which he possessed, encumbered,
                              at the early age of eighteen, with the cares of a
                              family; obscure, unknown and almost unpitied; digging,
                              with wearied limbs and with an aching heart, a small

                                    There is reason to believe, however, that at a later period, he may have

                                    notes on this passage, that when he was at college at Williamsburg, he

                              night which relieved him from toil. Little could the
                              wealthy and great of the land, as they rolled along the
                              highway in splendour, and beheld the young rustic at
                              work in the coarse garb of a labourer, covered with
                              dust and melting in the sun, have suspected that this
                              was the man who was destined not only to humble their
                              pride, but to make the prince himself tremble on his
                              distant throne, and to shake the brightest jewels from the
                              British crown. Little, indeed, could he himself have
                              suspected it; for amidst the distresses which thickened
                              around him at this time, and threatened him not only
                              with obscurity but with famine, no hopes came to cheer
                              the gloom, nor did there remain to him any earthly
                              consolation, save that which he found in the bosom of his
                              own family. Fortunately for him, there never was a
                              heart which felt this consolation with greater force. No
                              man ever possessed the domestic virtues in a higher degree,
                              or enjoined, more exquisitely, those pure delights
                              which flow from the endearing relations of conjugal life.

                           <p id="d145581e560">Mr. Henry's want of agricultural skill, and his unconquerable
                              aversion to every species of systematic labour,
                              drove him, necessarily, after a trial of two years, to abandon
                              his pursuit altogether. His next step seems to have
                              been dictated by absolute despair; for, selling off his little
                              possessions, at a sacrifice for cash, he entered, a second
                              time, on the inauspicious business of merchandize.
                              Perhaps, he flattered himself that he would be able to
                              profit by his past experience, and conduct this experiment
                              to a more successful issue. But if he did so, he
                              deceived himself. He soon found that he had not changed
                              his character, by changing his pursuits. His early
                              habits still continued to haunt him. The same want of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e562"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="13"> </a></span>
                              method, the same facility of temper, soon became apparent
                              by their ruinous effects. He resumed his violin, his
                              flute, his books, his curious inspection of human nature;
                              and not unfrequently ventured to shut up his store, and
                              indulge himself in the favourite sports of his youth.

                           <p id="d145581e565">His reading, however, began to assume a more serious
                              character. He studied geography, in which it is said
                              that he became an adept. He read, also, the charters
                              and history of the colony. He became fond of historical
                              works generally, particularly those of Greece and
                              Rome; and, from the tenacity of his memory and the
                              strength of his judgment, soon made himself a perfect
                              master of their contents. Livy was his favourite; and
                              having procured a translation, he became so much
                              enamoured of the work, that he made it a standing rule
                              to read it through, once at least, in every year, during
                              the earlier part of his life. <a href="note5" class="ref-external" n="5" rend="sc"> *</a> The grandeur of the

                              filled him with surprise and admiration; and he was
                              particularly enraptured with those vivid descriptions
                              and eloquent harangues with which the work abounds.
                              Fortune could scarcely have thrown in his way, a book
                              better fitted to foster his republican spirit, and awaken
                              the still dormant powers of his genius; and it seems not
                              improbable, that the lofty strain in which he himself
                              afterwards both spoke and acted, was, if not originally
                              inspired, at least highly raised, by the noble models set
                              before him by this favourite author.

                              unfortunate than the first. In a few years it left him a
                              bankrupt, and placed him in a situation than which it is
                              difficult to conceive one more wretched. Every atom
                              of his property was now gone, his friends were unable

                              support, of which he could suppose himself capable, and
                              every one had failed; ruin was behind him; poverty, debt,
                              want, and famine before; and, as if his cup of misery
                              were not already full enough, here were a suffering
                              wife and children to make it overflow.

                              possessed great native firmness of character; and, let me
                              add, great reliance, too, on that unseen arm which
                              never long deserts the faithful. Thus supported, he
                              was able to bear up under the heaviest pressure of
                              misfortune, and even to be cheerful, under circumstances
                              which would sink most other men into despair.

                           <p id="d145581e585">It was at this period of his fortunes, that Mr. Jefferson
                              became acquainted with him; and the reader, I am
                              persuaded, will be gratified with that gentleman's own
                              account of it. These are his words. “My acquaintance
                              with Mr. Henry commenced in the winter of
                              1759-60. On my way to the college, I passed the
                              Christmas holidays, at col. Dandridge's, in Hanover,
                              to whom Mr. Henry was a near neighbour. During
                              the festivity of the season, I met him in society every
                              day, and we became well acquainted, although I was
                              much his junior, being then in my seventeenth year,
                              and he a married man. His manners had something
                              of coarseness in then; his passion was music, dancing
                              and pleasantry. He excelled in the last, and it attached
                              every one to him. You ask some account of his
                              mind and information at this period; but you will
                              recollect that we were almost continually engaged in the
                              usual revelries of the season. The occasion perhaps,
                              as much as his idle disposition, prevented his engaging
                              in any conversation which might give the measure
                              either of his mind or information. Opportunity was
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e587"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="15"> </a></span>
                              not, indeed, wholly wanting; because Mr. John Campbell
                              was there, who had married Mrs. Spotswood, the
                              sister of col. Dandridge. He was a man of science,
                              and often introduced conversation on scientific subjects.
                              Mr. Henry had, a little before, broken up his store, or
                              rather it had broken him up; but his misfortunes were
                              not to be traced, either in his countenance or conduct.”

                           <p id="d145581e591">This cheerfulness of spirit, under a reverse of fortune
                              so severe, is certainly a very striking proof of the
                              manliness of his character. It is not, indeed, easy to
                              conceive that a mind like Mr. Henry's could finally sink
                              under any pressure of adversity. Such a mind, although
                              it may not immediately perceive whither to direct
                              its efforts, must always possess a consciousness of
                              power sufficient to buoy it above despondency. But, be
                              this as it may, of Mr. Henry, it was certainly true, as
                              Doctor Johnson has observed of Swift, that “he was
                              not one of those who, having lost one part of life in
                              idleness, are tempted to throw away the remainder in despair.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e594">It seems to be matter of surprise, that even yet,
                              amidst all these various struggles for subsistence, the
                              powers of his mind had not so developed themselves as
                              to suggest to any friend the pursuit for which he was
                              formed. He seems to have been a plant of slow growth,
                              but, like other plants of that nature, formed for duration,
                              and fitted to endure the buffetings of the rudest storm.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e597">It was now, when all other experiments had failed,
                              that, as a last effort, he determined, of his own accord,
                              to make a trial of the law. No one expected him to
                              succeed in any eminent degree. His unfortunate habits
                              were, by no means, suited to so laborious a profession:
                              and even if it were not too late in life for him to hope
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e599"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span>
                              to master its learning, the situation of his affairs forbade
                              an extensive course of reading. In addition to these
                              obstacles, the business of the profession, in that quarter,
                              was already in hands from which it was not easily
                              to be taken; for (to mention no others) judge Lyons, the
                              late president of the court of appeals, was then at the
                              bar of Hanover and the adjacent counties, with an
                              unrivalled reputation for legal learning; and Mr. John
                              Lewis, a man, also, of very respectable legal attainments,
                              occupied the whole field of forensic eloquence.
                              Mr. Henry, himself, seems to have hoped for nothing
                              more from the profession than a scanty subsistence for
                              himself and his family, and his preparation was suited
                              to these humble expectations; for to the study of a
                              profession, which is said to require the lucubrations of
                              twenty years, Mr. Henry devoted not more than six
                              weeks.<a href="note6" class="ref-external" n="6" rend="sc"> *</a> On this preparation, however, he obtained a
                              license to practise the law. How he passed with two
                              of the examiners, I have no intelligence; but he himself
                              used to relate his interview with the third. This was
                              no other than Mr. John Randolph, who was afterwards
                              the king's attorney general for the colony; a gentleman
                              of the most courtly elegance of person and manners, a
                              polished wit, and a profound lawyer. At first, he was
                              so much shocked by Mr. Henry's very ungainly figure
                              and address, that he refused to examine him:
                              understanding, however, that he had already obtained two
                              signatures, he entered, with manifest reluctance, on the
                              business. A very short time was sufficient to satisfy
                              him of the erroneous conclusion which he had drawn
                              from the exterior of the candidate. With evident marks

                              of increasing surprise (produced no doubt by the peculiar
                              texture and strength of Mr. Henry's style, and the
                              boldness and originality of his combinations) he continued
                              the examination for several hours: interrogating
                              the candidate, not on the principles of municipal law,
                              in which he no doubt soon discovered his deficiency,
                              but on the laws of nature and of nations, on the policy
                              of the feudal system, and on general history, which last
                              he found to be his strong hold. During the very short
                              portion of the examination which was devoted to the
                              common law, Mr. Randolph dissented, or affected to
                              dissent, from one of Mr. Henry's answers, and called upon
                              him to assign the reasons of his opinion. This produced
                              an argument; and Mr. Randolph now played off
                              on him, the same arts which he himself, had so often
                              practised on his country customers; drawing him out
                              by questions, endeavouring to puzzle him by subtleties,
                              assailing him with declamation, and watching continually,
                              the defensive operations of his mind. After a considerable
                              discussion, he said, “you defend your opinions
                              well, sir; but now to the law and to the testimony.”
                              Hereupon he carried him to his office, and opening the
                              authorities, said to him, “behold the force of natural
                              reason; you have never seen these books, nor this principle
                              of the law; yet you are right and I am wrong; and
                              from the lesson which you have given me (you must
                              excuse me for saying it) I will never trust to appearances
                              again. Mr. Henry, if your industry be only half
                              equal to your genius, I augur that you will do well, and
                              become an ornament and an honour to your profession.”
                              It was always Mr. Henry's belief that Mr. Randolph
                              had affected this difference of opinion, merely to
                              afford him the pleasure of a triumph, and to make some
                              atonement for the wound which his first repulse had
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e612"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span>
                              inflicted. Be this as it may, the interview was followed
                              by the most marked and permanent respect on the part

                              obtained his license. Of the science of law, he knew
                              almost nothing: of the practical part he was so wholly
                              ignorant, that he was not only unable to draw a declaration
                              or a plea, but incapable it is said, of the most common
                              and simple business of his profession, even of the
                              mode of ordering a suit, giving a notice, or making a
                              motion in court. It is not at all wonderful therefore,
                              that such a novice, opposed as he was by veterans,
                              covered with the whole armour of the law, should
                              linger in the background, for three years.<a href="note8" class="ref-external" n="8" rend="sc">†</a>

                              were extreme. The profits of his practice could not
                              have supplied them even with the necessaries of life;
                              and he seems to have spent the greatest part of his time,

                                    states it as coming from Mr. Henry himself. It was written before I had
                                    received the following statement from Mr. Jefferson; and although there is
                                    some difference in the circumstances, it has not been thought important
                                    enough to make an alteration of the text necessary. This is Mr. Jefferson's
                                    statement. “In the spring of 1760, he came to Williamsburg to obtain a
                                    license as a lawyer, and he called on me at college. He told me he had
                                    been reading law only six weeks. Two of the examiners, however, Peyton
                                    and John Randolph, men of great facility of temper, signed his license with
                                    as much reluctance as their dispositions would permit them to show. Mr.
                                    Wythe abslutely refused. Robert C. Nicholas refused also at first; but on
                                    repeated importunities and promises of future reading, he signed. These
                                    facts I had afterwards from the gentlemen themselves; the two Randolphs
                                    acknowledging he was very ignorant of the law, but that they perceived
                                    him to be a young man of genius, and did not doubt that he would soon
                                    qualify himself.”

                              two or three years, with his father-in-law, Mr. Shelton,
                              who then kept the tavern at Hanover court house.
                              Whenever Mr. Shelton was from home, Mr. Henry
                              supplied his place in the tavern, received the guests, and
                              attended to their entertainment. All this was very natural
                              in Mr. Henry's situation, and seems to have been purely
                              the voluntary movement of his naturally kind and obliging
                              disposition. Hence, however, a story has arisen, that in
                              the early part of his life, he was a bar-keeper by
                              profession. The fact seems not to have been so: but if it
                              had been, it would certainly have redounded much more
                              to his honour than to his discredit; for as Mr. Henry
                              owed no part of his distinction either to birth or fortune,
                              but wholly to himself, the deeper the obscurity and
                              poverty from which he emerged, the stronger is the evidence
                              which it bears to his powers, and the greater glory does
                              it shed around him.

                           <p id="d145581e642">About the time of Mr. Henry's coming to the bar, a
                              controversy arose in Virginia, which gradually produced
                              a very strong excitement, and called to it, at length, the
                              attention of the whole state.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e646">This was the famous controversy between the clergy
                              on the one hand, and the legislature and people of the
                              colony on the other, touching the stipend claimed by the
                              former; and as this was the occasion on which Mr.
                              Henry's genius first broke forth, those who take an
                              interest in his life, will not be displeased by a particular
                              account of the nature and grounds of the dispute. It
                              will be borne in mind, that the church of England was
                              at this period, the established church of Virginia; and,
                              by an act of assembly passed so far back as the year
                              1696, each minister of a parish had been provided with
                              an annual stipend of sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco.
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e648"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span>
                              This act was re-enacted with amendments, in 1748,
                              and in this form, had received the royal assent. The
                              price of tobacco had long remained stationary at two
                              pence in the pound, or sixteen shillings and eight pence
                              per hundred. According to the provision of the law,
                              the clergy had the right to demand, and were in the
                              practice of receiving payment of their stipend, in the
                              specific tobacco; unless they chose, for convenience,
                              to commute it for money at the market price. In the
                              year 1755, however, the crop of tobacco, having fallen
                              short, the legislature passed “an act to enable the
                              inhabitants of this colony, to discharge their tobacco
                              debts in money for the present year:” by the provisions
                              of which “all persons from whom any tobacco was due,
                              were authorized to pay the same either in tobacco, or in
                              money, 
                              <hi id="d145581e650" style="font-style: italic;">after the rate of sixteen shillings and eight pence
                                 per hundred, at the option of the debtor
                              </hi>.” This act was
                              to continue in force for ten months and no longer, and
                              did not contain the usual clause of suspension, 
                              <hi id="d145581e653" style="font-style: italic;">until it
                                 should receive the royal assent
                              </hi>. Whether the scarcity of
                              tobacco was so general and so notorious, as to render
                              this act a measure of obvious humanity and necessity, or
                              whether the clergy were satisfied by its generality, since
                              it embraced sheriffs, clerks, attornies, and all other
                              tobacco creditors, as well as themselves, or whether
                              they acquiesced in it as a temporary expedient, which
                              they supposed not likely to be repeated, it is certain that
                              no objection was made to the law at that time. They
                              could not indeed, have helped observing the benefits
                              which the rich planters derived from the act; for they
                              were receiving from fifty to sixty shillings per hundred
                              for their tobacco, while they paid off their debts, due in
                              that article, at the old price of sixteen shillings and eight
                              pence. Nothing, however, was then said in defence
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e656"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="21"> </a></span>
                              either of the royal prerogative, or of the rights of the
                              clergy, but the law was permitted to go peaceably
                              through its ten months operation. The great tobacco
                              planters had not forgotten the fruits of this act, when,
                              in the year 1758, 
                              <hi id="d145581e658" style="font-style: italic;">upon a surmise</hi> that another short
                              crop was likely to occur, the provisions of the act of
                              1755 were re-enacted, and the new law, like the former,
                              contained no suspending clause. The crop, as had
                              been anticipated, did fall short, and the price of tobacco
                              rose immediately from sixteen and eight pence to fifty
                              shillings per hundred. The clergy now took the alarm,
                              and the act was assailed by an indignant, sarcastic, and
                              vigorous pamphlet, entitled “The Two-Penny Act,”
                              from the pen of the Rev. John Camm, the rector of
                              York-Hampton parish, and the Episcopalian commissary
                              for the colony.<a href="note9" class="ref-external" n="9" rend="sc"> *</a> He was answered by two pamphlets,
                              written, the one by col. Richard Bland, and the
                              other by col. Landon Carter, in both which the commissary
                              was very roughly handled. He replied, in a
                              still severer pamphlet, under the ludicrous title of “The
                              Colonels Dismounted.” The colonels rejoined; and this
                              war of pamphlets, in which, with some sound argument,
                              there was a great deal of what Dryden has called “the
                              horse play of raillery,” was kept up, until the whole
                              colony, which had at first looked on for amusement,
                              kindled seriously in the contest from motives of
                              interest. Such was the excitement produced by the
                              discussion, and at length so strong the current against
                              the clergy, that the printers found it expedient to shut
                              their presses against them in this colony, and Mr. Camm

                              pamphlets are still extant; and it seems impossible to
                              deny, at this day, that the clergy had much the best of
                              the argument. The king in his council, took up the
                              subject, denounced the act of 1755 as an usurpation,
                              and declared it utterly null and void. Thus supported,
                              the clergy resolved to bring the question to a judicial
                              test; and suits were accordingly brought by then, in the
                              various county courts of the colony, to recover their
                              stipends in the specific tobacco. They selected the
                              county of Hanover as the place of the first experiment;
                              and this was made in a suit instituted by the Rev. James
                              Maury,<a href="note10" class="ref-external" n="10" rend="sc"> *</a> against the collector of that county and his
                              sureties. The record of this suit is now before me.
                              The declaration is founded on the act of 1748 which
                              gives the tobacco; the defendants pleaded specially the
                              act of 1758, which authorizes the commutation into
                              money, at sixteen and eight pence: to this plea the
                              plaintiff demurred; assigning, for causes of demurrer,
                              first, that the act of 1758, not having received the royal
                              assent, had not the force of a law; and, secondly, that
                              the king, in council, had declared that act null and
                              void. The case stood for argument on the demurrer
                              to the November term, 1763, and was argued by Mr.
                              Lyons for the plaintiff, and Mr. John Lewis for the
                              defendants; when the court, very much to the credit of
                              their candour and firmness, breasted the popular current
                              by sustaining the demurrer. Thus far the clergy sailed
                              before the wind, and concluded, with good reason, that
                              <a class="note-marker" href="#d145581e676">010</a><note data-tapas-note-num="010" id="d145581e676" style="font-variant: small-caps;" n="10" place="foot" anchored="true" target="ref10">

                                    also, sets down “The Two-Penny Act” to the speculations of a man by the

                              their triumph was complete: for the act of 1758 having
                              been declared void by the judgment on the demurrer;
                              that of 1748 was left in full force, and became, in law,
                              the only standard for the finding of the jury. Mr. Lewis
                              was so thoroughly convinced of this, that he retired
                              from the cause; informing his clients that it had been,
                              in effect, decided against them, and that there remained
                              nothing more for him to do. In this desperate situation,
                              they applied to Patrick Henry, and he undertook to
                              argue it for them before the jury, at the ensuing term.
                              Accordingly, on the first day of the following December,
                              he attended the court, and, on his arrival, found on the
                              court-yard, such a concourse, as would have appalled
                              any other man in his situation. They were not the
                              people of the county merely, who were there, but
                              visitors from all the counties, to a considerable distance
                              around. The decision upon the demurrer, had produced
                              a violent ferment amongst the people, and equal exultation
                              on the part of the clergy; who attended the court in
                              a large body, either to look down opposition, or to enjoy
                              the final triumph of this hard fought contest, which they
                              now considered as perfectly secure. Among many
                              other clergymen, who attended on this occasion, came
                              the Reverend Patrick Henry, who was the plaintiff in
                              another cause of the same nature, then depending in
                              court. When Mr. Henry saw his uncle approach, he
                              walked up to his carriage, accompanied by col. Meredith,
                              and expressed his regret at seeing him there.
                              “Why so?” enquired the uncle. “Because, sir,” said
                              Mr. Henry, “you know that I have never yet spoken
                              in public, and I fear that I shall be too much overawed
                              by your presence, to be able to do my duty to my clients;
                              besides sir, I shall be obliged to say some 
                              <hi id="d145581e685" style="font-style: italic;">hard things</hi>
                              of the clergy, and I am very unwilling to give pain to
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e688"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="37" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span>
                              your feelings.” His uncle reproved him for having
                              engaged in the cause; which Mr. Henry excused by
                              saying, that the clergy had not thought him worthy of
                              being retained on their side, and he knew of no moral
                              principle by which he was bound to refuse a fee
                              from their adversaries; besides, he confessed, that in
                              this controversy, both his heart and judgment, as well
                              as his professional duty, were on the side of the people;
                              he then requested that his uncle would do him the
                              favour to leave the ground. “Why, Patrick,” said the
                              old gentleman with a good-natured smile, “as to 
                              <hi id="d145581e690" style="font-style: italic;">your</hi>
                              saying hard things of the clergy, I advise you to let that
                              alone—take my word for it, you will do yourself more
                              harm than you will them; and as to my leaving the
                              ground, I fear, my boy, that my presence could neither
                              do you harm or good, in such a cause. However; since
                              you seem to think otherwise, and desire it of me, so
                              earnestly, you shall be gratified.” Whereupon, he
                              entered his carriage again, and returned home.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e694">Soon after the opening of the court, the cause was
                              called. It stood on a writ of inquiry of damages, no plea
                              having been entered by the defendants since the judgment
                              on the demurrer. The array before Mr. Henry's
                              eyes was now most fearful. On the bench sat more than
                              twenty clergymen, the most learned men in the colony,
                              and the most capable, as well as the severest critics before
                              whom it was possible for him to have made his 
                              <hi id="d145581e696" style="font-style: italic;">debut</hi>. The court house was crowded with an overwhelming
                              multitude, and surrounded with an immense and anxious
                              throng, who not finding room to enter, were endeavouring
                              to listen without, in the deepest attention. But there
                              was something still more awfully disconcerting than all
                              this; for in the chair of the presiding magistrate, sat no
                              other person, than his own father. Mr. Lyons opened
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e699"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="25"> </a></span>
                              the cause very briefly: in the way of argument he did
                              nothing more than explain to the jury, that the decision
                              upon the demurrer had put the act of 1750 entirely out
                              of the way, and left the law of 1748 as the only standard
                              of their damages; he then concluded with a highly
                              wrought eulogium on the benevolence of the clergy.
                              And, now, came on the first trial of Patrick Henry's
                              strength. No one had ever heard him speak, and curiosity
                              was on tiptoe. He rose very awkwardly, and faultered
                              much in his exordium. The people hung their
                              heads at so unpromising a commencement; the clergy
                              were observed to exchange sly looks with each other;
                              and his father is described as having almost sunk with
                              confusion, from his seat. But these feelings were of
                              short duration, and soon gave place to others, of a very
                              different character. For, now, were those wonderful
                              faculties which he possessed, for the first time developed;
                              and now, was first, witnessed that mysterious and almost
                              supernatural transformation of appearance, which the
                              fire of his own eloquence never failed to work in him.
                              For as his mind rolled along, and began to glow from
                              its own action, all the 
                              <hi id="d145581e701" style="font-style: italic;">

                              shed themselves, spontaneously. His attitude, by degrees,
                              became erect and lofty. The spirit of his genius
                              awakened all his features. His countenance shone with
                              a nobleness and grandeur which it had never before
                              exhibited. There was a lightning in his eyes which
                              seemed to rive the spectator. His action became graceful,
                              bold, and commanding; and in the tones of his voice,
                              but more especially in his emphasis, there was a peculiar
                              charm, a magic, of which any one who ever heard
                              him, will speak as soon as he is named, but of which no
                              one can give any adequate description. They can only
                              say that it struck upon the ear and upon the heart,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e707"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span>

                              his wonder-working fancy, and the peculiar phraseology
                              in which he clothed its images; for he painted to the heart
                              with a force that almost petrified it. In the language
                              of those who heard him on this occasion, “he made
                              their blood run cold, and their hair to rise on end.”

                           <p id="d145581e713">It will not be difficult for any one, who ever heard
                              this most extraordinary man, to believe the whole
                              account of this transaction which is given by his
                              surviving hearers; and from their account, the court house
                              of Hanover county, must have exhibited on this occasion,
                              a scene as picturesque, as has been ever witnessed
                              in real life. They say, that the people, whose
                              countenances had fallen as he arose, had heard but a
                              very few sentences before they began to look up; then
                              to look at each other with surprise, as if doubting the
                              evidence of their own senses; then, attracted by some
                              strong gesture, struck by some majestic attitude,
                              fascinated by the spell of his eye, the charm of his emphasis,
                              and the varied and commanding expression of his
                              countenance, they could look away no more. In less
                              than twenty minutes, they might be seen in every part
                              of the house, on every bench, in every window, stooping
                              forward from their stands, in death-like silence; their
                              features fixed in amazement and awe; all their senses
                              listening and rivetted upon the speaker; as if to catch
                              the last strain of some heavenly visitant. The mockery
                              of the clergy was soon turned into alarm; their triumph
                              into confusion and despair; and at one burst of his
                              rapid and overwhelming invective, they fled from the
                              bench in precipitation and terror. As for the father,
                              such was his surprise, such his amazement, such his
                              rapture, that, forgetting where he was, and the character
                              which he was filling, tears of ecstacy streamed down
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e715"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span>

                           <p id="d145581e718">The jury seem to have been so completely bewildered,
                              that they lost sight not only of the act of 1748, but
                              that of 1758 also; for thoughtless even of the admitted
                              right of the plaintiff, they had scarcely left the bar,
                              when they returned with a verdict 
                              <hi id="d145581e720" style="font-style: italic;">of one penny
                                 damages
                              </hi>. A motion was made for a new trial; but the
                              court too, had now lost the equipoise of their judgment,
                              and overruled the motion by an unanimous vote. The
                              verdict and judgment overruling the motion, were followed
                              by redoubled acclamation, from within and without
                              the house. The people, who had with difficulty kept
                              their hands off their champion, from the moment of
                              closing his harangue, no sooner saw the fate of the
                              cause finally sealed, than they seized him at the bar, and
                              in spite of his own exertions, and the continued cry of
                              “order” from the sheriffs and the court, they bore him
                              out of the court house, and raising, him on their
                              shoulders, carried him about the yard, in a kind of
                              electioneering triumph.

                              can only tell you in general, that they were taken captive;
                              and so delighted with their captivity, that they
                              followed implicitly, whithersoever he led them. That,
                              at his bidding, their tears flowed from pity, and their
                              cheeks flushed with indignation. That when it was
                              over, they felt as if they had just awaked from some
                              ecstatic dream, of which they were unable to recal or
                              connect the particulars. It was such a speech as they
                              believe had never before fallen from the lips of man;
                              and to this day, the old people of that county cannot
                              conceive that a higher compliment can be paid to a speaker
                              than to say of him, in their own homely phrase, 
                              <hi id="d145581e740" style="font-style: italic;">“he is
                                 almost equal to Patrick, when he plead against the parsons.”

                           <p id="d145581e745">The only topic of this speech of which any authentic
                              account remains, is the order of the king in council,
                              whereby the act of 1758 had been declared void. This
                              subject, had in truth been disposed of by the demurrer;
                              and, in strictness of proceeding, neither Mr. Henry nor
                              the jury had any thing to do with it. The laxity of the
                              county court practice, however, indulged him in the
                              widest career he chose to take, and he laid hold of this
                              point, neither with a feeble or hesitating hand; but boldly
                              and vigorously pressed it upon the jury, and that, too,
                              with very powerful effect. He insisted on the connection
                              and reciprocal duties between the king and his
                              subjects; maintained that government was a conditional
                              compact, composed of unusual and dependent covenants,
                              of which a violation by one party discharged the other;
                              and intrepidly contended that the disregard which had
                              been shown in this particular, to the pressing wants of the
                              colony, was an instance of royal misrule, which had thus
                              far dissolved the political compact, and left the people
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e747"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="42" data-tei-n="29"> </a></span>
                              at liberty to consult their own safety; that they had
                              consulted it by the act of 1758, which, therefore,
                              notwithstanding the dissent of the king and his council,
                              ought to be considered as the law of the land, and the
                              only legitimate measure of the claims of the clergy.

                           <p id="d145581e750">The nature of this topic, and the earnest and
                              undaunted manner in which Mr. Henry is said to have
                              pursued and maintained it, proves, that even at this period,
                              which has been marked as the era of our greatest
                              attachment and devotion to the parent country, 
                              <hi id="d145581e752" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi>
                              mind at least, was disposed to pry into the course of the
                              regal administration, and to speak forth his sentiments
                              without any fear of the consequences. The reception
                              which the people gave to the argument, proves that they
                              also, had no superstitious repugnance to the consideration
                              of such topics, nor any very insuperable horror at
                              the idea of a separation. Not that there is ground to
                              suspect that any one had at this time, realized such an
                              event, or even contemplated it as desirable. The suggestion,
                              therefore, which I have sometimes heard, that
                              Mr. Henry was already meditating the independence of
                              the colonies, and sowing the seeds of those reflections
                              which he wished to ripen into revolt, is in my opinion,
                              rather curious than just. I believe that he thought of
                              nothing beyond success in his cause; and since the
                              desperate posture in which he found it, demanded a daring
                              and eccentric course, he adopted that which has been
                              already stated. The character of his argument, proves
                              indeed, that he was naturally a bold and intrepid enquirer,
                              who was not to be overawed from his purpose
                              by the name even of sovereignty itself; and of course
                              that he was made of good revolutionary materials. But
                              an adequate provocation had not, at this time, been
                              given: and it would be imputing to Mr. Henry a criminal
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e755"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span>
                              ambition, of which there is no proof; to suppose
                              that he was meditating the subversion of a government,
                              against which the voice of serious complaint had not
                              yet been heard. Besides, Mr. Henry's standing in society
                              was at this period so humble, as to have rendered
                              the meditation of such a purpose, on his part, presumptuous
                              in the extreme; and equally inconsistent both with
                              his unassuming modesty, and that natural good sense
                              and accurate judgment, which are on all hands, assigned
                              to him.

                              retained on all the cases, within the range of his practice,
                              which depended on the same question. But no
                              other case was ever brought to trial. They were all,
                              throughout the colony, dismissed by the plaintiffs; nor
                              was any appeal ever prosecuted in the case of Mr.
                              Maury. The reason assigned for this by Mr. Camm, is,
                              that the legislature had voted money to support the appeal
                              on the part of the defendants, and that the clergy
                              were not rich enough to contend against the whole

                              the court. Mr. Henry is stigmatized in it 
                              <hi id="d145581e783" style="font-style: italic;">as an obscure

                              time past, but it was true no longer. His sun had
                              risen with a splendour which had never before been
                              witnessed in this colony; and never afterward, did it
                              disgrace this glorious rising.

                           <p id="d145581e795">IT is almost unnecessary to state that the display
                              which Mr. Henry had made in 
                              <hi id="d145581e797" style="font-style: italic;">“the parsons' cause,”</hi> as
                              it was popularly called, placed him, at once, at the head
                              of his profession, in that quarter of the colony in which
                              he practised. He became the theme of every tongue.
                              He had exhibited a degree of eloquence, which the
                              people had never before witnessed; a species of
                              eloquence too, entirely new at the bar, and altogether his
                              own. He had formed it on no living model; for there
                              was none such in the country. He had not copied it
                              from books, for they had described nothing of the kind;
                              or if they had, he was a stranger to their contents. Nor
                              had he formed it himself, by solitary study and exercise;
                              for he was far too indolent for any such process. It was
                              so unexampled, so unexpected, so instantaneous, and so
                              transcendent in its character, that it had, to the people,
                              very much the appearance of supernatural inspiration.
                              He was styled 
                              <hi id="d145581e800" style="font-style: italic;">“the orator of nature:”</hi> and was, on that
                              account, much more revered by the people than if he
                              had been formed by the severest discipline of the
                              schools; for they considered him as bringing his credentials
                              directly from heaven, and owing no part of his greatness
                              to human institutions.

                           <p id="d145581e804">There were other considerations also, which drew
                              him still more closely to the bosom of the people. The
                              society of Virginia, was at that time pretty strongly
                              discriminated. A gentleman who lived in those days,
                              and who had the best opportunities of judging on the
                              subject, has furnished the following interesting picture of it.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e807"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="46" data-tei-n="33"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e810">“To state the differences between the classes of the
                              society and the lines of demarcation which separated
                              them, would be difficult. The law, you know, admitted
                              none, except as to the twelve counsellors. Yet in a
                              country insulated from the European world, insulated from
                              its sister colonies, with whom there was scarcely any
                              intercourse, little visited by foreigners, and having little
                              matter to act upon within itself, certain families had risen
                              to splendour by wealth, and by the preservation of it
                              from generation to generation under the law of entails;
                              some had produced a series of men of talents; families
                              in general had remained 
                              <hi id="d145581e812" style="font-style: italic;">stationary</hi> on the grounds of
                              their forefather, for there was no emigration to the
                              westward in those days; the Irish, who had gotten
                              possession of the valley between the Blue Ridge and the
                              North Mountain, formed a barrier over which none
                              ventured to leap; and their manners presented no attraction
                              to the lowlanders to settle among them. In such
                              a state of things, scarcely admitting any change of
                              station, society would settle itself down into several
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e815" style="font-style: italic;">strata</hi>, separated by no marked lines, but shading off
                              imperceptibly from top to bottom, nothing disturbing
                              the order of their repose. There were, then, first
                              aristocrats, composed of the great landholders who had
                              seated themselves below tide water on the main rivers,
                              and lived in a style of luxury and extravagance, insupportable
                              by the other inhabitants, and which, indeed, ended,
                              in several instances, in the ruin of their own fortunes.
                              Next to these were what might be called 
                              <hi id="d145581e818" style="font-style: italic;">half breeds</hi>;
                              the descendants of the younger sons and daughters of
                              the aristocrats, who inherited the pride of their ancestors,
                              without their wealth. Then came the pretenders,
                              men who from vanity, or the impulse of growing wealth,
                              or from that enterprize which is natural to talents,

                              sought to detach themselves from the plebeian ranks, to
                              which they properly belonged, and imitated, at some
                              distance, the manners and habits of the great. Next to
                              these, were a solid and independent yeomanry, looking
                              askance at those above, yet not venturing to jostle them.

                              furnishing materials for the exercise of their pride,
                              insolence, and spirit of domination.”

                           <p id="d145581e830">It was from the body of the yeomanry, whom my
                              correspondent represents as “looking askance” at those
                              above them, that Mr. Henry proceeded. He belonged
                              to the body of the people. His birth, education, fortune,
                              and manners, made him one of themselves. They
                              regarded him, therefore, as their own property, and sent
                              to them, expressly for the very purpose of humbling
                              the pride of the mighty and exalting the honour of his
                              own class.

                           <p id="d145581e833">Mr. Henry had too much sagacity not to see this
                              advantage, and too much good sense not to keep and to
                              improve it. He seems to have formed to himself, very
                              early in life, just views of society, and to have acted
                              upon them with the most laudable system and perseverance.
                              He regarded government as instituted solely
                              for the good of the people; and not for the benefit of
                              those, who had contrived to make a job of it. He looked
                              upon the body of the people, therefore, as the 
                              <hi id="d145581e835" style="font-style: italic;">basis</hi>
                              of society, the fountain of all power, and, directly or
                              indirectly, of all offices and honours, which had been
                              instituted, originally, for 
                              <hi id="d145581e838" style="font-style: italic;">their</hi> use. He made it no secret,
                              therefore, nay he made it his boast, that on every occasion,
                              “he bowed to the majesty of the people.” With
                              regard to himself, he saw, very distinctly, that all his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e841"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="48" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>
                              hopes rested on the people's favour. He, therefore,
                              adhered to them with unshaken fidelity. He retained
                              their manners, their customs, all their modes of life, with
                              religious caution. He dressed as plainly as the plainest
                              of them; ate only the homely fare, and drank the simple
                              beverage of the country; mixed with them on a
                              footing of the most entire and perfect equality, and
                              conversed with them, even in their own vicious and
                              depraved pronunciation.<a href="note13" class="ref-external" n="13" rend="sc"> *</a>

                           <p id="d145581e847">If this last were the effect of artful compliance, as
                              has been strenuously affirmed, it was certainly carrying
                              the system farther than dignity would warrant. Mr.
                              Henry should have been the instructor as well as the
                              friend of the people, and by his example, have corrected,
                              instead of adopting their errors. It is very certain
                              that by this course he disgusted many of those whom
                              it was often his business to persuade; not because they
                              considered it as a proof of vulgarity and ignorance, but
                              because they regarded it as a premeditated artifice to
                              catch the favour and affections of the people. That it
                              was so, I am not disposed to believe. I think it much
                              more probable, that those errors of pronunciation were
                              the effect of early and inveterate habit, which had
                              become incurable before he was informed of his mistake.
                              He had no occasion to resort to such petty artifices,
                              either to gain or to hold the affections of the people.
                              He held them by a much higher and a much
                              firmer title; the simplicity of his manners; the

                                    questioned in this particular, by the acquaintances of Mr. Henry, who say, that
                                    he was too good a grammarian to have uttered such a sentence, although

                              benevolence of his disposition; the integrity of his life; his
                              real devotion to their best interests; that uncommon
                              sagacity which enabled him to discern those interests
                              in every situation; and the unshaken constancy with
                              which he pursued them, in spite of every difficulty and
                              danger that could threaten him. From the point of
                              time of which we are now speaking, it is very certain
                              that he suffered no gale of fortune, however high or
                              prosperous, to separate him from the people. Nor did
                              the people, on their part, ever desert him. He was the
                              man to whom they looked in every crisis of difficulty,
                              and the favourite on whom they were ever ready to lavish
                              all the honours in their gift.

                           <p id="d145581e870">Middleton, in his life of Cicero, tells us that the first
                              great speech of that orator, his defence of Roscius
                              the actor, was made at the age of twenty-seven; the
                              same age, he adds, at which the learned have remarked,
                              that Demosthenes distinguished himself in the
                              assembly of the Athenians: “As if this were the age”
                              (I quote his own words) “at which these great genios
                              regularly bloomed towards maturity.” It is rather
                              curious, than important, to observe, that Mr. Henry
                              furnishes another instance in support of this theory;
                              since it was precisely in the same year of his life, that

                              world. Nor let the admirer of antiquity revolt at our
                              coupling the name of Henry, with those of Cicero and
                              Demosthenes: it can be no degradation to the orator
                              either of Greece or Rome, that his name stands enrolled,
                              on the same page, with that of a man of whom such
                              a judge of eloquence as Mr. Jefferson has said, that

                              had derived from the “parsons' cause,” exquisite as it

                              must have been, was not sufficient to inspire him with a
                              thirst for the learning of his profession. He had an
                              insuperable aversion to 
                              <hi id="d145581e883" style="font-style: italic;">the old black letter of the law

                              </hi>, (which was often a topic of raillery with him,)
                              and he was never able to conquer it, except for preparation
                              in some particular cause. No love of distinction,
                              no necessity however severe, were strong enough to
                              bind him down to a regular course of reading. He
                              could not brook the confinement. The reasoning of
                              the law was too artificial, and too much cramped for
                              him. Whilst unavoidably engaged in it, he felt as if
                              manacled. His mind was perpetually struggling to
                              break away. His genius delighted in liberty and space,
                              in which it might roam at large, and feast on every
                              variety of intellectual enjoyment. Hence he was never
                              profound in the learning of the law. On a question
                              merely legal, his inferiors, in point of talents, frequently
                              embarrassed and foiled him; and it required all the
                              resources of his extraordinary mind, to support the
                              distinction which he had now gained.

                              was in those days, but a slender dependance for a family.
                              Notwithstanding therefore, the great addition to
                              his business which we have noticed, Mr. Henry seems
                              still to have been pressed by want. With the hope of
                              improving his situation, he removed, in the year 1764, to
                              the county of Louisa, and resided at a place called
                              the Roundabout. Here I have learned nothing
                              remarkable of him, unless it may be thought so, that he
                              pursued his favourite amusement of hunting with
                              increased ardour. “After his removal to Louisa,” says
                              my informant, “he has been known to hunt deer,
                              frequently for several days together, carrying his provision
                              with him, and at night encamping in the woods. After
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e890"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="51" data-tei-n="38"> </a></span>
                              the hunt was over; he would go from the ground to
                              Louisa court, clad in a coarse cloth coat stained with
                              all the trophies of the chase, greasy leather breeches
                              ornamented in the same way, leggings for boots, and a
                              pair of saddle-bags on his arm. Thus accoutred, he
                              would enter the court house, take up the first of his
                              causes that chanced to be called; and if there was any
                              scope for his peculiar talent, throw his adversary into
                              the background, and astonish both court and jury by
                              the powerful effusions of his natural eloquence.”

                              in Mr. Henry's mode of speaking, even on the
                              most trivial subjects. The late judge Lyons has been
                              heard to say of himself, while practising with Mr. Henry,
                              “that he could write a letter, or draw a declaration
                              or plea at the bar, with as much accuracy as he could
                              in his office, under all circumstances,

                              <hi id="d145581e898" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> rose, although
                              it might be on so trifling a subject as a summons
                              and petition, for twenty shillings, he was obliged to lay
                              down his pen, and could not write another word, until
                              the speech was finished.” Such was the charm of his
                              voice and manner, and the interesting originality of his
                              conceptions!

                              He made no preparation for it, but went down just in
                              the kind of garb which he had been accustomed to
                              exhibit all his life, and is said to have worn, on this

                              exhibited, with the general elegance of the place, was so
                              striking, as to call upon him the eyes of all the curious

                              incident, says, “Some time after, a member of the

                              for a day or two, observed an ill-dressed young man
                              sauntering in the lobby; that he seemed to be a stranger
                              to every body, and he had not the curiosity to enquire
                              his name; but, that attending when the case of
                              the contested election came on, he was surprised to find
                              this same person counsel for one of the parties; and
                              and still more so, when he delivered an argument
                              superior to any thing he had ever heard.” The case,
                              according to the report of the committee of privileges
                              and elections, is not one which seems to present much
                              scope for a very interesting discussion: but Mr. Henry's
                              was one of those minds which impart interest to every

                              of that great question which led finally to the independence

                              gentleman, at least as well qualified to judge as any other

                              parliament, they breathe nevertheless, a tone so suppliant,
                              and exhibit such a picture of anticipated suffering from

                              colony, as to indicate that no opposition beyond
                              remonstrance, was at this time, meditated. Remonstrance,
                              however, was vain. In January, 1765, the famous
                              stamp act was passed, to take effect in the colonies on
                              the first of November following. The annunciation of

                              spread the intelligence among the people, were themselves
                              manifestly confounded; and so far from inspiring

                              by force, was no where glanced at in the most distant
                              manner; no heart seems to have been bold enough at
                              first, to conceive it. Men, on other occasions marked
                              for intrepidity and decision, now hung back; unwilling to
                              submit, and yet afraid to speak out in the language of
                              bold and open defiance. It was just at this moment of
                              despondency in some quarters, suspense in others, and
                              surly and reluctant submission wherever submission
                              appeared, that Patrick Henry stood forth to raise the

                              heard his argument on the contested election of Mr.
                              Littlepage, the preceding winter. His dress and manners
                              were still those of the plain planter, and in his personal
                              appearance, there was nothing to excite curiosity
                              or awaken expectation. The forms of the house, of
                              which he was now for the first time a member, were,
                              as has been stated, most awfully dignified; its active
                              members were composed of the landed aristocracy and
                              their adherents; and amongst them were men to whose
                              superiority of talents, as well as influence and power,
                              the yeomanry of the country had long been accustoned
                              to bow, with tacit and submissive deference.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1013">John Robinson, the speaker of the house, was one of
                              the most opulent men in the colony, and the acknowledged
                              head of its landed aristocracy. He had now
                              filled the chair of the house with great dignity, and
                              without interruption, for five and twenty years. He was
                              also, the colonial treasurer; and from the high offices
                              which he held, in connexion with the regal government,
                              was as warmly attached to its authority by interest, as
                              he was by taste and fashion, to all the grandeur of its
                              forms. But, notwithstanding this close alliance with
                              the court, his personal influence, in every class of
                              society was very great; and he held that influence by a
                              tenure far superior to any that his own vast wealth or the
                              power of the crown could confer. For he possessed a
                              strong and well informed mind, enlarged and corrected
                              by great experience, and he united with it, a benevolence
                              of spirit and a courtesy of manners, which never
                              failed to attach every heart that approached him. The
                              poor drew near to him without awe or embarrassment;
                              they came indeed, with filial confidence; for they never
                              failed to find in him, a sympathetic friend, and an able
                              counsellor. The rich enjoyed in him an easy, enlightened,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1015"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="58" data-tei-n="45"> </a></span>
                              and instructive companion; and, next to the
                              governor, regarded him as the highest model of elegance
                              and fashion. An anecdote is related of this gentleman,
                              which displays in a strong and amiable light, the exalted
                              force of his feelings, and the truly noble cast of his manners.
                              When col. Washington (the immortal saviour
                              of his country) had closed his career in the French and
                              Indian war, and had become a member of the house of
                              burgesses, the speaker, Robinson, was directed by a
                              vote of the house, to return their thanks to that gentleman,
                              on behalf of the colony, for the distinguished military
                              services which he had rendered to his county. As
                              soon as col. Washington took his seat, Mr. Robinson,
                              in obedience to this order, and following the impulse of
                              his own generous and grateful heart, discharged the
                              duty, with great dignity; but with such warmth of
                              colouring and strength of expression, as entirely
                              confounded the young hero. He rose to express his
                              acknowledgments for the honour; but such was his
                              trepidation and confusion, that he could not give distinct
                              utterance to a single syllable. He blushed, stammered,
                              and trembled, for a second; when the speaker relieved
                              him, by a stroke of address that would have done honour
                              to Louis the XIV. in his proudest and happiest moment.
                              “Sit down, Mr. Washington,” said he, with a
                              conciliating smile; “your modesty is equal to your
                              valour; and that surpasses the power of any language
                              that I possess.”<a href="note21" class="ref-external" n="21" rend="sc"> *</a>

                                    lore; but a most ungraceful speaker in debate. He wrote the first
                                    pamphlet on the nature of the connexion with Great Britain, which had any
                                    pretension to accuracy of view on that subject; but it was a singular one;
                                    he would set out on sound principles, pursue them logically, till he found
                                    them leading to the precipice which we had to leap; start back, alarmed;
                                    then resume his ground, go over it in another direction, be led again by the
                                    correctness of his reasoning, to the same place, and again tack about and
                                    try other processes to reconcile right and wrong; but left his reader and

                              that expression of unclouded intelligence and extensive
                              reach, which seemed to denote him capable of any thing,
                              that could be effected by the power of the human mind.
                              His mind itself, was of a very fine order. It was clear,
                              comprehensive, sagacious and correct; with a most acute
                              and subtle faculty of discrimination; a fertility of expedient
                              which could never be exhausted; a dexterity of
                              address which never lost an advantage and never gave
                              one; and a capacity for continued and unremitting application,
                              which was perfectly invincible. As a lawyer and
                              a stateman, he had few equals; no superiors. For
                              parliamentary management, he was without a rival. With
                              all these advantages of person, manners, address and
                              intellect, he was also a speaker of distinguished eminence.
                              He had that silver voice<a href="note24" class="ref-external" n="24" rend="sc"> *</a> of which Cicero makes such
                              frequent and honourable mention—an articulation
                              uncommonly distinct—a perennial stream of transparent,
                              cool and sweet elocution; and the power of presenting his
                              arguments with great simplicity, and striking effect. He
                              was always graceful, argumentative, persuasive: never
                              vehement, rapid, or abrupt. He could instruct and delight;
                              but he had no pretensions to those high powers which are
                              calculated to “shake the human soul.” George Wythe,
                              also, a member of the House, was confessedly among
                              the first in point of abilities. There is a story circulated,
                              as upon his own authority, that he was initiated by his
                              mother, in the Latin classics.<a href="note25" class="ref-external" n="25" rend="sc">†</a> Be this as it may, it is
                              certain that he had raised upon the original foundation,
                              whencesoever acquired, a superstructure of ancient
                              literature which has been rarely equalled in this country.
                              He was perfectly familiar with the authors of Greece

                              and Rome; read them with the same ease and quoted
                              them with the same promptitude that he could the
                              authors in his native tongue. He carried his love of
                              antiquity rather too far; for he frequently subjected
                              himself to the charge of pedantry; and his admiration of
                              the gigantic writers of Queen Elizabeth's reign, had
                              unfortunately betrayed him into an imitation of their
                              quaintness. Yet, with all this singularity of taste, he
                              was a man of great capacity; powerful in argument;
                              frequently pathetic; and elegantly keen and sarcastic in
                              repartee. He was long the rival of Mr. Pendleton at the
                              bar; whom he equalled as a common lawyer, and greatly
                              surpassed as a civilian: but he was too open and direct
                              in his conduct, and possessed too little management
                              either with regard to his own temper or those of other
                              men, to cope with so cool and skilful an adversary.
                              Though a full match for Mr. Pendleton in the powers of
                              fair and solid reasoning, Mr. Pendleton could whenever
                              he pleased, and would whenever it was necessary,
                              tease him with quibbles, and vex him with sophistries,
                              until he destroyed the composure of his mind and robbed
                              him of his strength. No man was ever more entirely
                              destitute of art than Mr. Wythe. He knew nothing, even
                              in his profession, and never would know any thing of
                              “crooked and indirect by-ways.” Whatever he had to
                              do, was to be done openly, avowedly and above board.
                              He would not, even at the bar, have accepted of success
                              on any other terms. This simplicity and integrity of
                              character, although it sometimes exposed him to the
                              arts and sneers of the less scrupulous, placed him
                              before his countrymen, on the ground which Caesar wished
                              his wife to occupy; he was not only pure, but above all
                              suspicion. The unaffected sanctity of his principles,
                              united with his modesty and simple elegance of manners,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1099"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="62" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span>
                              his attic wit, his stores of rare knowledge, his capacity
                              for business, and the real power of his intellect, not
                              only raised him to great eminence in public, but rendered
                              him a delightful companion, and a most valuable friend.

                           <p id="d145581e1103">But Richard Henry Lee was the Cicero of the house.
                              His face itself, was on the Roman model; his nose
                              Caesarean; the port and carriage of his head, leaning
                              persuasively and gracefully forward; and the whole
                              contour noble and fine. Mr. Lee was, by far, the most
                              elegant scholar in the house. He had studied the
                              classics in the true spirit of criticism. His taste had
                              that delicate touch, which seized with intuitive certainty,
                              every beauty of an author, and his genius that native
                              affinity which combined them without an effort. Into
                              every walk of literature and science, he had carried this
                              mind of exquisite selection, and brought it back to the
                              business of life, crowned with every light of learning,
                              and decked with every wreath, that all the Muses, and
                              all the Graces, could entwine. Nor did those light
                              decorations constitute the whole value of its freight. He
                              possessed a rich store of historical and political knowledge,
                              with an activity of observation, and a certainty of judgment,
                              that turned that knowledge to the very best account.
                              He was not a lawyer by profession; but he understood
                              thoroughly the constitution both of the mother country
                              and of her colonies; and the elements also, of the civil
                              and municipal law. Thus, while his eloquence was free
                              from those stiff and technical restraints, which the habits
                              of forensic speaking are so apt to generate, he had
                              all the legal learning which is necessary to a statesman.
                              He reasoned well, and declaimed freely and splendidly.
                              The note of his voice was deeper and more melodious than
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1105"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="50"> </a></span>
                              that of Mr. Pendleton. It was the canorous voice<a href="note26" class="ref-external" n="26" rend="sc"> *</a> of
                              Cicero. He had lost the use of one of his hands, which
                              he kept constantly covered with a black silk bandage
                              neatly fitted to the palm of his hand, but leaving his
                              thumb free; yet, notwithstanding this disadvantage, his
                              gesture was so graceful and so highly finished, that it
                              was said he had acquired it by practising before a
                              mirror.<a href="note27" class="ref-external" n="27" rend="sc">†</a> Such was his promptitude, that he required
                              no preparation for debate. He was ready for any subject,
                              as soon as it was announced; and his speech was
                              so copious, so rich, so mellifluous, set off with such
                              bewitching cadence of voice, and such captivating grace of
                              action, that, while you listened to him, you desired to
                              hear nothing superior, and indeed thought him perfect.
                              He had a quick sensibility and a fervid imagination,
                              which Mr. Pendleton wanted. Hence his orations
                              were warmer and more delightfully interesting; yet still,
                              to him those keys were not consigned, which could
                              unlock the sources either of the strong or tender passions.
                              His defect was, that he was too smooth and too
                              sweet. His style bore a striking resemblance to that of
                              Herodotus, as described by the Roman orator: “he
                              flowed on, like a quiet and placid river, without a ripple.”<a href="note28" class="ref-external" n="28" rend="sc">‡</a>
                              He flowed, too, through banks covered with all
                              the fresh verdure and variegated bloom of the spring;
                              but his course was too subdued, and too beautifully
                              regular. A cataract, like that of Niagara, crowned
                              with overhanging rocks and mountains, in all the rude
                              and awful grandeur of nature, would have brought him
                              nearer to the standard of Homer and of Henry.

                              shone in the house of burgesses in the year 1765.
                              There was, yet, a cluster of minor luminaries, which it
                              were endless to delineate, but whose blended rays
                              contributed to form that uncommon galaxy, in which the
                              plebeian Henry was now called upon to take his place.
                              What had he to enable him to cope with all this lustre of
                              talents and erudition? Very little more than the native
                              strength of his character; a constancy of soul, which no
                              array of power could shake; a genius that designed with
                              all the boldness of Angelo, and an imagination that
                              coloured with all the felicity of Titian.

                           <p id="d145581e1159">It has been already stated that Mr. Henry was elected
                              with express reference to an opposition to the stamp
                              act. It was not, however, expected by his constituents
                              or meditated by himself, that he should lead the opposition.
                              The addresses of the preceding year, made to the

                              had been stated, as that the stamp act, if persisted in,
                              would reduce the colony to a state of slavery, founded
                              a hope, that those who had commenced the opposition
                              by remonstrance, would continue to give it the

                              bolder should be necessary. Mr. Henry waited, therefore,
                              to file in under the first champion that should raise
                              the banner of colonial liberty. In the mean time another
                              subject, unexpectedly, occurred to call him up,
                              and it was on this other, that he made his

                              “The gentlemen of this country had, at that time, become
                              deeply involved in that state of indebtment, which has
                              since ended in so general a crush of their fortunes.
                              Mr. Robinson, the speaker, was also the treasurer, an
                              honour always chosen by the assembly. He was an
                              excellent man, liberal, friendly, and rich. He had been
                              drawn in to lend on his own account, great sums of
                              money to persons of this description, and especially
                              those who were of the assembly. He used freely for
                              this purpose the public money, confiding for its replacement
                              in his own means, and the securities he had taken
                              on those loans. About this time, however, he became
                              sensible that his 
                              <hi id="d145581e1181" style="font-style: italic;">deficit</hi> to the public was become so
                              enormous, as that a discovery must soon take place, for
                              as yet the public had no suspicion of it. He devised,
                              therefore, with his friends in the assembly, a plan for a
                              public loan office, to a certain amount, from which monies
                              might be lent on public account, and on good landed
                              security, to individuals. I find, in Royle's Virginia
                              Gazette of the 17th of May, 1765, this proposition for
                              a loan office presented, its advantages detailed, and the
                              plan explained. It seems to have been done by a
                              borrowing member, from the feeling with which the motives
                              are expressed, and to have been preparatory to the
                              intended motion. Between the 17th and 30th, (the latter
                              being the date of Mr. Henry's resolutions on the
                              stamp act,) the motion for a loan office was accordingly
                              brought forward in the house of burgesses; and had it
                              succeeded, the deficit due to Robinson on these loans,
                              would have been transferred to the public, and his 
                              <hi id="d145581e1184" style="font-style: italic;">deficit</hi>
                              thus completely covered. This state of things, however,
                              was not yet known: but Mr. Henry attacked the
                              scheme on other general grounds, in that style of bold,
                              grand, and overwhelming eloquence, for which he
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1188"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="66" data-tei-n="53"> </a></span>
                              became so justly celebrated afterward. I had been
                              intimate with him from the year 1759-60, and felt an
                              interest in what concerned him; and I can never forget a
                              particular exclamation of his in the debate, which
                              electrified his hearers. It had been urged, that, from
                              certain unhappy circumstances of the colony, men of
                              substantial property had contracted debts, which, if
                              exacted suddenly, must ruin them and their families, but
                              with a little indulgence of time, might be paid with ease.
                              ‘What, sir,’ exclaimed Mr. Henry, in animadverting
                              on this, ‘is it proposed then, to reclaim the spendthrift
                              from his dissipation and extravagance, by filling his
                              pockets with money?’ These expressions are indelibly
                              impressed on my memory. He laid open with so much
                              energy the spirit of favouritism, on which the proposition
                              was founded, and the abuses to which it would
                              lead, that it was crushed in its birth. He carried with
                              him all the members of the upper counties, and left a
                              minority composed merely of the aristocracy of the country.
                              From this time his popularity swelled apace; and Mr.
                              Robinson dying, the year afterwards, his 
                              <hi id="d145581e1190" style="font-style: italic;">deficit</hi> was
                              brought to light, and discovered the true object of the
                              proposition.”<a href="note30" class="ref-external" n="30" rend="sc"> *</a>

                                 this motion was to be found on the journals of the day, and begged my
                                 correspondent to explain it, which he does very satisfactorily in the following
                                 terms. “Abortive motions are not always entered on the journals, or rather
                                 they are rarely entered. It is the modern introduction of yeas and nays
                                 which has given the means of placing a rejected motion on the journals: and
                                 it is likely that the speaker, who, as treasurer, was to be the loan officer, and
                                 had the direction of the journals, would choose to omit an entry of the
                                 motion in this case. This accounts sufficiently for the absence of any trace of
                                 the motion on the journals. There was no suspicion then, (so far at least as
                                 I knew,) that Mr. Robinson had used the public money in private loans to his
                                 friends, and that the secret object of this scheme was to transfer those
                                 debtors to the public, and thus clear his accounts. I have diligently
                                 examined the names of the members on the journals of 1764, to see if any were
                                 still living, to whose memory we might recur on this subject; but I find not
                                 a single one now remaining in life.” This debate must have been in 1765,
                                 instead of 1764. The only surviving member of that year is Paul Carrington,
                                 sen. esq. He took his seat in the house after the debate in question.

                              as having electrified Mr. Henry's hearers, is a striking
                              specimen of one of his great excellences in speaking;
                              which was, the power of condensing the substance of a
                              long argument, into one short pithy question. The
                              hearer was surprised, in finding himself brought so
                              suddenly and so clearly, to a just conclusion. He could
                              scarcely conceive how it was effected; and could not
                              fail to regard, with high admiration, the power of that
                              intellect, which could come at its ends by so short a
                              course, and work out its purposes with the quickness
                              and certainty of magic.

                           <p id="d145581e1205">The aristocracy were startled at such a 
                              <hi id="d145581e1207" style="font-style: italic;">phenomenon</hi>
                              from the plebeian ranks. They could not be otherwise
                              than indignant at the presumption of an obscure and
                              unpolished rustic, who, without asking the support or
                              countenance of any patron among themselves, stood
                              upon his own ground, and bearded them even in their
                              strong hold. That this rustic should have been able
                              too, by his single strength, to baffle their whole phalanx
                              and put it to rout, was a mortification too humiliating
                              to be easily borne. They affected to ridicule his vicious
                              and depraved pronunciation, the homespun coarseness
                              of his language, and his hypocritical canting in relation
                              to his humility and ignorance. But they could not help
                              admiring and envying his wonderful gift; that thorough
                              knowledge of the human heart which he displayed;
                              that power of throwing his reasoning into short and
                              clear aphorisms; which, desultory as they were, supplied
                              in a great degree, the place of method and logic; that
                              imagination so copious, poetic, and sublime; the irresistible
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1210"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="68" data-tei-n="55"> </a></span>
                              power with which he caused every passion to rise
                              at his bidding; and all the rugged might and majesty
                              of his eloquence. From this moment, he had no friends
                              on the aristocratic side of the house. They looked
                              upon him with envy and with terror. They were forced
                              at length to praise his genius; but that praise was
                              wrung from them, with painful reluctance. They
                              would have denied it, if they could. They would have
                              overshadowed it; and did at first try to overshadow it,
                              by magnifying his defects; but it would have been as
                              easy for them to have eclipsed the splendour of the sun
                              by pointing to his spots.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1213">If, however, he had lost one side of the house by his
                              undaunted manner of blowing up this aristocratic project,
                              he had made the other side his fast friends. 
                              <hi id="d145581e1215" style="font-style: italic;">They</hi>
                              had listened with admiration, unmixed with envy. Their
                              souls had been struck with amazement and rapture
                              and thrilled with unspeakable sensations which they
                              had never felt before. The man too, who had produced
                              these effects, 
                              <hi id="d145581e1218" style="font-style: italic;">was one of themselves</hi>. This was
                              balm to them; for there is a wide difference between
                              that distant admiration, which we pay as a tax, due to
                              long-standing merit, in superior rank, and that throbbing
                              applause which rushes spontaneously and warm
                              from the heart, towards a new man and an equal.
                              There is always something of latent repining, approaching
                              to resentment, mingled with that respect which is
                              exacted from us by rank; and we feel a secret gratification
                              in seeing it humbled. In the same proportion,
                              we love the man who has given us this gratification, and
                              avenged as it were, our own past indignities. Such
                              was precisely the state of feeling which Mr. Henry
                              produced, on the present occasion. The lower ranks of
                              the house beheld and heard him with gratitude and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1221"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="69" data-tei-n="56"> </a></span>
                              veneration. They regarded him as a sturdy and wide
                              spreading oak, beneath whose cool and refreshing shade
                              they might take refuge from those beams of aristocracy,
                              that had played upon them so long, with rather an
                              unpleasant heat.

                           <p id="d145581e1225">After this victorious sally upon their party, the former
                              leaders of the house, were not very well disposed to
                              look with a favourable eye, on any proposition which he
                              should make. They had less idea of contributing to
                              foster the popularity and pamper the power of a man,
                              who seemed born to be their scourge, and to drag down
                              their ancient honours to the dust. It was in this
                              unpropitious state of things, after having waited in vain
                              for some step to be taken on the other side of the house,
                              and when the session was within three days of its expected
                              close, that Mr. Henry introduced his celebrated
                              resolutions on the stamp act.

                              transaction from the pen of Mr. Henry himself. It is
                              a curiosity, and highly worthy of preservation. After his
                              death, there was found among his papers one sealed,
                              and thus endorsed: “Inclosed are the resolutions of the
                              Virginia assembly in 1765, concerning the stamp act.
                              Let my executors open this paper.” Within was found
                              the following copy of the resolutions, in Mr. Henry's

                              handwriting of Mr. Henry himself. “The within
                              resolutions passed the house of burgesses in May, 1765.
                              They formed the first opposition to the stamp act, and
                              the scheme of taxing America by the British parliament.
                              All the colonies, either through fear, or want of opportunity
                              to form an opposition, or from influence of some
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1257"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="71" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span>
                              kind or other, had remained silent. I had been for the
                              first time elected a burgess, a few days before, was
                              young, inexperienced, unacquainted with the forms of
                              the house, and the members that composed it. Finding
                              the men of weight averse to opposition, and the
                              commencement of the tax at hand, and that no person was
                              likely to step forth, I determined to venture, and alone,
                              unadvised, and unassisted, on a blank leaf of an old law
                              book<a href="note31" class="ref-external" n="31" rend="sc"> *</a> wrote the within. Upon offering them to the
                              house, violent debates ensued. Many threats were
                              uttered, and much abuse cast on me, by the party for
                              submission. After a long and warm contest, the resolutions
                              passed by a very small majority, perhaps of one or two
                              only. The alarm spread throughout America with
                              astonishing quickness, and the ministerial party were
                              overwhelmed. The great point of resistance to British
                              taxation was universally established in the colonies. This
                              brought on the war, which finally separated the two
                              countries, and gave independence to ours. Whether
                              this will prove a blessing or a curse, will depend upon
                              the use our people make of the blessings which a gracious
                              God hath bestowed on us. If they are wise, they
                              will be great and happy. If they are of a contrary
                              character, they will be miserable.—Righteousness alone
                              can exalt them as a nation.

                              to the house; these were, John Fleming, a most respectable
                              member for the county of Cumberland, and George

                           <p id="d145581e1283">The reader will remark that the first four resolutions,
                              as left by Mr. Henry, do little more than re-affirm the
                              principles advanced in the address, memorial and
                              remonstrance of the preceding year; that is, they deny the
                              right assumed by the British parliament, and assert the
                              exclusive right of the colony to tax itself. There is an
                              important difference, however, between those state
                              papers and the resolutions, in the point of time and the
                              circumstances under which they were brought forward,
                              for the address and other state papers were prepared
                              before the stamp act had passed; they do nothing more,
                              therefore, than call in question, by a course of respectful
                              and submissive reasoning, the propriety of exercising
                              the right, before it had been exercised; and they are,

                                    the day, that Mr. Johnston drew the resolutions, is certainly unfounded. Mr.
                                    Johnston, now known only from the circumstance of his having seconded
                                    Mr. Henry's resolutions, is one of those many friends of liberty, who are
                                    sliding fast from the recollection of their country, and who deserve to be
                                    rescued from oblivion, by a more particular notice, than it is in my power to
                                    bestow upon them. Of Mr. Johnston, I can learn only, that he was a lawyer
                                    in the Northern Neck, highly respectable in his profession; a scholar,
                                    distinguished for vigour of intellect, cogency of argument, firmness of character,
                                    love of order; and devotion to the cause of rational liberty—in short, exactly
                                    calculated by his love of the cause, and the broad and solid basis of his
                                    understanding, to uphold the magnificent structure of Henry's eloquence.

                              Henry offered his resolutions, the stamp act had passed;
                              and the resolutions were intended for the people of the
                              colonies. It will, also, be observed that the fifth resolution,
                              as given by Mr. Henry, contains the bold assertion,
                              that every attempt to vest the power of taxation over the
                              colonies, in any person or persons whatsoever, other
                              than the General Assembly, had a manifest tendency to
                              destroy British, as well as American freedom; which
                              was asserting in effect, that the act which had passed,
                              was an encroachment on the rights and liberties of the
                              people, and amounted to a direct charge of tyranny
                              and despotism, against the British king, lords and commons.

                              rights, who knew the feeble and defenceless situation
                              of this country, should be startled at a step so bold and
                              daring. That effect was produced; and the resolutions
                              were resisted not only by the aristocracy of the house,
                              but by many of those who were afterwards, distinguished
                              among the brightest champions of American liberty.

                              resolutions successively. They were opposed by Messrs.
                              Randolph, Bland, Pendleton, Wythe, and all the old
                              members whose influence in the house had, till then,
                              been unbroken. They did it, not from any question of
                              our rights, but on the ground that the same sentiments
                              had been, at their preceding session, expressed in a
                              more conciliatory form, to which the answers were not
                              yet received. But torrents of sublime eloquence from
                              Henry, backed by the solid reasoning of Johnston,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1306"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="74" data-tei-n="61"> </a></span>
                              prevailed. The last, however, and strongest resolution was
                              carried but by a single vote. The debate on it was
                              most bloody. I was then but a student, and stood at the
                              door of communication between the house and the
                              lobby (for as yet there was no gallery) during the whole
                              debate and vote; and I well remember that, after the
                              numbers on the division were told and declared from
                              the chair, Peyton Randolph (the attorney general) came
                              out at the door where I was standing, and said as he
                              entered the lobby, ‘by God I would have given 500 guineas
                              for a single vote:’ for one vote would have divided the
                              house, and Robinson was in the chair, who he knew
                              would have negatived the resolution. Mr. Henry left
                              town that evening; and the next morning before the
                              meeting of the house, col. Peter Randolph, then of
                              the council, came to the hall of burgesses, and sat at the
                              clerk's table till the house bell rang, thumbing over the
                              volumes of journals, to find a precedent of expunging a
                              vote of the house, which he said, had taken place while
                              he was a member or clerk of the house, I do not recollect
                              which. I stood by him at the end of the table, a
                              considerable part of the time, looking on, as he turned
                              over the leaves; but I do not recollect whether he found
                              the erasure. In the mean time, some of the timid members
                              who had voted for the strongest resolution, had
                              become alarmed; and as soon as the house met, a
                              motion was made and carried to expunge it from the
                              journals. There being at that day but one printer, and he
                              entirely under controul of the governor, I do not know
                              that this resolution ever appeared in print. I write this
                              from memory: but the impression made on me at the
                              time was such as to fix the facts indelibly in my mind.
                              I suppose the original journal was among those destroyed
                              by the British, or its obliterated face might be

                              appealed to. And here I will state that Burk's statement
                              of Mr. Henry's consenting to withdraw two resolutions,
                              by way of compromise with his opponents, is entirely
                              erroneous.”

                                    Journals of 1765, page 150. Several historical mistakes have been committed
                                    in relation to these resolutions. Judge Marshall, in his life of Washington,
                                    (2d vol. note 4th, of the appendix) gives an erroneous copy of them,
                                    from the book called Prior Documents; in this, he is set right by the journals;
                                    he represents six as having been offered, and two rejected; his
                                    authority for this, again, is the Prior Documents; but he is contradicted by
                                    Mr. Henry himself, who represents five only as having been offered and
                                    past, and Mr. Henry's written statement accords with the clear and strong
                                    recollection both of Mr. Jefferson, and Mr. Carrington. Mr. Burk gives the
                                    same erroneous copy with judge Marshall, and adds to them several
                                    mistakes of his own: he says the resolutions passed, by a large majority, 
                                    <hi id="d145581e1350" style="font-style: italic;">forty
                                       only having voted against them
                                    </hi>. Mr. Burk did not know the number of the
                                    members, or he would have known that a vote of forty in the negative,
                                    would not have left a large majority in favour of the resolutions. But we
                                    have the authority of Mr. Henry himself, (as we have seen) of Mr. Jefferson,
                                    and of Mr. Carrington, for saying that the resolutions were carried by a
                                    majority of 
                                    <hi id="d145581e1353" style="font-style: italic;">one only</hi>; on what authority Mr. Burk speaks, we are not informed.
                                    His whole account of Mr. Henry's proposal on the next day, to secede,
                                    and of his finally giving up two resolutions, for the sake of unanimity, is
                                    contradicted again by Mr. Henry, Mr. Jefferson, and Mr. Carrington; there is
                                    no such statement in the papers of the day, and the author does not condescend
                                    to give us his authority. Mr. Burk's skeleton of Mr. Henry's speech,
                                    on that occasion, is believed to be equally apocryphal; the author of these
                                    sketches has not been able to procure a single authentic trace of that speech,
                                    except the anecdote presently given in the text. Mr. Burk concludes his
                                    account of this affair, thus: “Struck with the alarming tendency of these

                                    page 310. In opposition to this statement, we are told by Mr. Henry himself,
                                    that when he offered his resolutions, the session was near its regular close;
                                    and the journals prove the fact to have been so. Mr. Henry left town for
                                    home, on the evening of the day on which his resolutions were adopted; it
                                    was on the next day (consequently in his absence,) that the motion to
                                    rescind was made; and the printed journals show that day and the day following,
                                    to have been occupied with the usual business which closes a legislative session.

                           <p id="d145581e1361">“By these resolutions,” says Mr. Jefferson, “and
                              his manner of supporting them, Mr. Henry took the
                              lead out of the hands of those who had, theretofore,
                              guided the proceedings of the house; that is to say, of
                              Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, Randolph.” It was, indeed,
                              the measure which raised him to the zenith of his glory.
                              He had never before had a subject which entirely
                              matched his genius, and was capable of drawing out all
                              the powers of his mind. It was remarked of him,
                              throughout his life, that his talents never failed to rise
                              with the occasion, and in proportion with the resistance
                              which he had to encounter. The nicety of the vote on
                              his last resolution, proves that this was not a time to hold
                              in reserve, any part of his forces. It was, indeed, an
                              alpine passage, under circumstances even more
                              unpropitious than those of Hanibal; for he had not only to
                              fight, hand to hand, the powerful party who were already
                              in possession of the heights, but at the same instant,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1363"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="78" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span>
                              to cheer and animate the timid band of followers, that
                              were trembling, fainting, and drawing back, below
                              him. It was an occasion that called upon him to put
                              his strength, and he did put it forth, in such a
                              manner, as man never did before. The cords of argument,
                              with which his adversaries frequently flattered
                              themselves they had bound him fast, became pack-threads
                              in his hands. He burst them, with as much
                              ease, as the unshorn Sampson did the bands of the
                              Philistines. He seized the pillars of the temple, shook
                              them terribly, and seemed to threaten his opponents
                              with ruin. It was an incessant storm of lightning and
                              thunder, which struck them aghast. The faint-hearted
                              gathered courage from his countenance, and cowards
                              became heroes, while they gazed upon his exploits.

                              he was descanting on the tyranny of the obnoxious act,
                              that he exclaimed, in a voice of thunder, and with the
                              look of a god, “Caesar had his Brutus—Charles the
                              first, his Cromwell—and George the third—(‘Treason,’

                              from every part of the house.—It was one of those trying
                              moments which is decisive of character.—Henry
                              faultered not for an instant; but rising to a loftier
                              attitude, and fixing on the speaker an eye of the most
                              determined fire, he finished his sentence with the firmest

                                    with such variations of the concluding words, that I began to doubt whether
                                    the whole might not be fiction. With a view to ascertain the truth, therefore,
                                    I submitted it to Mr. Jefferson, as it had been given to me by judge Tyler,
                                    and this is his answer. “I well remember the cry of treason, the pause
                                    of Mr. Henry at the name of George the III. and the presence of mind
                                    with which he closed his sentence, and baffled the charge vociferated.” The
                                    incident, therefore, becomes authentic history.

                              escaped him during the debate. He was, throughout
                              life, one of the most perfectly and uniformly decorous
                              speakers, that ever took the floor of the house. He was
                              respectful even to humility; and the provocation must
                              be gross indeed, which would induce him to notice it.
                              Yet when he did notice it, better were it for the man
                              never to have been born, than to fall into the hands of
                              such an adversary. One lash from his scourge was infamy
                              for life; his look of anger or contempt, was almost death.

                           <p id="d145581e1390">After this debate, there was no longer a question,
                              among the body of the people, as to Mr. Henry's being
                              the first statesman and orator in Virginia. Those, indeed,
                              whose ranks he had scattered, and whom he had
                              thrown into the shade, still tried to brand him with the
                              names of declaimer and demagogue. But this was
                              obviously the effect of envy and mortified pride. A mere
                              declaimer and demagogue, could never have gained,
                              much less have kept for more than thirty years, that
                              ground which Mr. Henry held; with a people, too, so
                              cool, judicious, firm, and virtuous, as those who achieved
                              the American revolution.

                              Mr. Henry became the idol of the people of Virginia;
                              nor was his name confined to his native state. His light
                              and heat were seen and felt throughout the continent;
                              and he was every where regarded as the great champion
                              of colonial liberty.

                           <p id="d145581e1396">The impulse thus given by Virginia, was caught by
                              the other colonies. Her resolutions were every where
                              adopted, with progressive variations. The spirit of
                              resistance became bolder and bolder, until the whole
                              continent was in a flame; and by the first of November,

                              when the stamp act was, according to its provisions, to
                              have taken effect, its execution had become utterly

                                    the progress of these feelings. We have already given a specimen
                                    of the drooping spirit of the Pennsylvania Gazette, on the first annunciation
                                    of the stamp act; but after Mr. Henry had touched, with his match, the
                                    train of American courage, its scintillations were seen, sparkling and flashing,
                                    on every page of this paper. Thus in the paper of June 20th, 1775—
                                    “We learn from the northward, that the stamp act is to take place in America
                                    on All Saints' day, the first of November next.—In the year 1755, on the

                                    destroyed the city of Lisbon.”

                              announced the repeal of the stamp act; and the house of
                              burgesses, in a paroxysm of feeling, voted a statue to
                              the king, and an obelisk to the British patriots by whose
                              exertions the repeal had been effected. But before
                              these monuments of national gratitude could be executed,
                              the effervescence subsided; and on the 9th of December,
                              1766, the bill which had been prepared for that purpose,
                              was postponed to the first day of the next session; after
                              which, we hear of it no more.

                           <p id="d145581e1421">At the session of 1766, a question of great interest in
                              those days, and one of real importance to the colony,
                              came on to be discussed in the house of burgesses. Mr.
                              Robinson, who had so long held the joint offices of
                              speaker and treasurer, was now dead. The general
                              fact of his delinquency as treasurer, was understood,
                              although the sum was not yet ascertained: and that
                              delinquency, whatever it might be, was alleged to have
                              arisen principally, from loans made to members of the
                              house of burgesses. As the speaker, although elected
                              in the first instance by the house, could not act until
                              approved by the governor, and when so approved, was
                              in office for seven years, re-eligible indefinitely—and as
                              in the recent instance of Mr. Robinson, it had been
                              discovered that an office so held, was too apt to generate
                              a devotion to the purposes of the British court—it was
                              considered by the patriots in the house, as a measure
                              of sound policy, to take out of the hands of the speaker
                              so formidable an engine of corruption and power, as the

                              treasury of the colony.<a href="note37" class="ref-external" n="37" rend="sc"> *</a> A motion was therefore made
                              to separate the office of treasurer from the speaker's
                              chair, which was supported by Mr. Henry with his
                              usual ability. An arduous struggle ensued. Innovations,
                              however correct in themselves, never fail to startle
                              those who have grown grey in a veneration for the
                              existing order of things. They fancy that they see in
                              every important change, an indirect blow at the
                              established government, and at the foundations of their own
                              property. This union of the speaker's chair with the
                              office of treasurer, was one of those errors in policy
                              which time had consecrated, and it required a hand
                              both steady and skilful, to remove the veil and expose
                              its deformity. That hand was furnished by Mr. Henry.
                              The union of boldness and decency which composed his
                              character, of decisive energy in the support of his own
                              opinions, and respectful tenderness towards those of
                              others, fitted him peculiarly for the discharge of this
                              duty. The house admired on this occasion, the facility
                              with which he could adapt himself to any subject. He
                              had that foundation of strong natural sense, without
                              which genius is a misfortune; an instinctive accuracy
                              of judgment, which always proportioned his efforts to
                              the occasion. He was never guilty of the ridiculous
                              and common error amongst young members, of
                              attempting to force the subject beyond its nature—of

                                    was but one clear and sound bottom on which the separation of the chair and
                                    the treasury was decided. The legislature made all the levies of money
                                    payable into the hands of their speaker, over whom they had controul. The only
                                    hold the governor had on him, was a negative on his appointment as
                                    speaker at every new election, which amounted, consequently, to a negative
                                    on him as treasurer, and disposed him, so far, to be obsequious to the
                                    governor.”

                              of the bar, Mr. Henry came, in the year 1769, to
                              the bar itself, of the general court. “The profits of his
                              practice theretofore, (says my informant,) must have been
                              very moderate. For, about this time, he informed me

                              fifteen hundred pounds; adding that, if he could only

                           <p id="d145581e1471">It cannot be expected from Mr. Henry's legal preparation,
                              that he was able to contend with these gentlemen
                              on a mere question of law. He wanted that learning,
                              whose place no splendour of genius can supply to
                              the lawyer; and he wanted those habits of steady and
                              persevering application, without which that learning is
                              not to be acquired. It is said indeed, that he was wofully
                              deficient as a lawyer: so little acquainted with the
                              fundamental principles of his profession, and so little
                              skilled in that system of artificial reasoning on which
                              the common law is built, as not to be able to see the
                              remote bearings of the reported cases: and hence, it has
                              been said, that it happened with him not unfrequently,
                              whenever he did attempt to argue a question of law, to
                              furnish authorities destructive to his own cause. Yet
                              he never did and never could vanquish his aversion to
                              the systematic study of the law. On questions turning
                              on the laws of nations, and even on the maritime law,
                              whose basis is natural reason and justice, his vigour of
                              mind, made him occasionally, very great. One of my
                              correspondents, for example, relates to me an instance
                              of his appearing in the court of admiralty, under the
                              regal government, in behalf of a Spanish captain, whose
                              vessel and cargo had been libelled. A gentleman, who
                              was present, and who was very well qualified to judge,
                              was heard to declare, after the trial was over, that he
                              never heard a more eloquent or argumentative speech
                              in his life; that Mr. Henry was, on that occasion, greatly
                              superior to Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Mason, or any other
                              counsel who spoke to the subject; and that he was
                              astonished how Mr. Henry could have acquired such a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1473"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span>
                              knowledge of the maritime law, to which, it was believed,
                              he had never before turned his attention.

                           <p id="d145581e1476">But this special preparation on a given subject, and
                              that subject too, descending on the liberal and equitable
                              principles of the maritime law, is not at all at variance
                              with the report of his inefficiency, on questions to be
                              decided by the common law merely. The power of arguing
                              questions of the latter description to advantage,
                              requires the mind, in the first place, to be deeply
                              imbued with that peculiar spirit of reasoning which reigns
                              throughout the whole system of the common law; and,
                              in the next, it requires a cool and clear accuracy of
                              thinking, and an elaborate exactness and nicety in the
                              deduction of thought, to which Mr. Henry's early and
                              inveterate habits of indolence, as well as the sublime
                              and excursive fervour of his genius, were altogether hostile.

                           <p id="d145581e1479">It was on questions before a jury, that he was in his
                              natural element. There, his intimate knowledge of human
                              nature, and the rapidity as well as justness of his
                              inferences, from the flitting expressions of the
                              countenance, as to what was passing in the hearts of his
                              hearers, availed him fully. The jury might be composed
                              of entire strangers, yet he rarely failed to know
                              them, man by man, before the evidence was closed.
                              There was no studied fixture of features, that could
                              long hide the character from his piercing and experienced
                              view. The slightest unguarded turn of countenance,
                              or motion of the eye, let him at once into the soul
                              of the man whom he was observing. Or, if he doubted
                              whether his conclusions were correct, from the exhibitions
                              of countenance during the narration of the evidence,
                              he had a mode of playing a prelude as it were,
                              upon the jury, in his exordium, which never failed to

                              whole compass as well as pitch of the instruments and,
                              indeed, (if we may believe all the concurrent accounts
                              of his exhibitions in the general court,) the most exquisite
                              performer that ever “swept the sounding lyre,”
                              had not a more sovereign mastery over its powers, than
                              Mr. Henry had over the springs of feeling and thought
                              that belong to a jury. There was a delicacy, a taste, a
                              felicity, in his touch, that was perfectly original, and
                              without a rival. His style of address, on these occasions,
                              is said to have resembled very much that of the
                              scriptures. It was strongly marked with the same
                              simplicity, the same energy, the same pathos. He sounded
                              no alarm; he made no parade, to put the jury on their
                              guard. It was all so natural, so humble, so unassuming,
                              that they were carried imperceptibly along, and
                              attuned to his purpose, until some master touch dissolved
                              them into tears. His language of passion was perfect.
                              There was no word “of learned length or thundering
                              sound,” to break the charm. It had almost all the stillness
                              of solitary thinking. It was a sweet reverie, a delicious
                              trance. His voice, too, had a wonderful effect.
                              He had a singular power of infusing it into a jury, and
                              mixing its notes with their nerves, in a manner which it
                              is impossible to describe justly; but which produced a
                              thrilling excitement, in the happiest concordance with
                              his designs. No man knew so well as he did what kind
                              of topics to urge to their understandings; nor what kind
                              of simple imagery to present to their hearts. His eye,
                              which he kept rivetted upon them, assisted the process
                              of fascination, and at the same time informed him what
                              theme to press, or at what instant to retreat, if by rare
                              accident he touched an unpropitious string. And then
                              he had such an exuberance of appropriate thoughts, of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1483"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="87" data-tei-n="74"> </a></span>
                              apt illustrations, of apposite images, such a melodious
                              and varied roll of the happiest words, that the
                              hearer was never wearied by repetition, and never
                              winced from an apprehension that the intellectual
                              treasures of the speaker would be exhausted.<a href="note39" class="ref-external" n="39" rend="sc"> *</a>

                           <p id="d145581e1489">The defence of criminal causes was his great professional
                              forte. It seems that the eighth day of the general
                              court was formerly set apart for criminal business.
                              Mr. Henry made little or no figure, during the civil days
                              of the court; but on the eighth day, he was the monarch
                              of the bar. These causes brought him into direct
                              collision with Mr. John Randolph, who had now
                              succeeded Peyton as the attorney general.

                           <p id="d145581e1493">Mr. Randolph, it has been remarked, was, in person
                              and manners, among the most elegant gentlemen in the
                              colony, and in his profession, one of the most splendid
                              ornaments of the bar. He was a polite scholar, as well
                              as a profound lawyer, and his eloquence also was of a

                                 <p id="d145581e1497"> * A striking example of this witchery of his eloquence, even on common
                                    subjects, was related by a very respectable gentleman, the late major Joseph
                                    Scott, the marshal of this state. This gentleman had been summoned, at
                                    great inconvenience to his private affairs, to attend as a witness a distant
                                    court, in which Mr. Henry practised. The cause which had carried him thither
                                    having been disposed of, he was setting out in great haste to return,
                                    when the sheriff summoned him to serve on a jury. This cause was
                                    represented as a complicated and important one; so important, as to have enlisted
                                    in it all the most eminent members of the bar. He was therefore alarmed at
                                    the prospect of a long detention, and made an unavailing effort with the
                                    court to get himself discharged from the jury. He was compelled to take
                                    his seat. When his patience had been nearly exhausted by the previous
                                    speakers, Mr. Henry rose to conclude the cause, and having much matter to
                                    answer, the major stated that he considered himself a prisoner for the evening,
                                    if not for the night. But, to his surprise, Mr. Henry appeared to have
                                    consumed not more than fifteen minutes in the reply; and he would scarcely
                                    believe his own watch, or those of the other jurymen, when they informed
                                    him that he had in reality been speaking upwards of two hours. So powerful
                                    was the charm by which he could bind the senses of his hearers, and
                                    make even the most impatient, unconscious of the lapse of time.

                              high order. His voice, action, style, were stately, and
                              uncommonly impressive; but gigantic as he was in relation
                              to other men, he was but a pigmy, when opposed
                              in a criminal trial, to the arch magician, Henry. In those
                              cases Mr. Henry was perfectly irresistible. He adapted
                              himself, without effort to the character of the cause; seized
                              with the quickness of intuition, its defensible point, and
                              never permitted the jury to lose sight of it. Sir Joshua
                              Reynolds has said of Titian, that, by a few strokes of
                              his pencil, he knew how to mark the image and character
                              of whatever object he attempted; and produced, by
                              this means a truer representation, than any of his
                              predecessors, 
                              <hi id="d145581e1503" style="font-style: italic;">who finished every hair</hi>. In like manner, Mr.
                              Henry by a few master strokes upon the evidence, could
                              in general stamp upon the cause whatever image or
                              character he pleased; and convert it into tragedy or
                              comedy, at his sovereign will, and with a power which
                              no efforts of his adversary could counteract. He never
                              wearied the jury by a dry and minute analysis of the
                              evidence; he did not expend his strength 
                              <hi id="d145581e1506" style="font-style: italic;">in finishing
                                 the hairs
                              </hi>; he produced all his high effect by those rare
                              master touches, and by the resistless skill, with which, in
                              a very few words, he could mould and colour the
                              prominent facts of a cause to his purpose. He had
                              wonderful address too, in leading off the minds of his
                              hearers from the contemplation of unfavourable points,
                              if at any time they were too stubborn to yield to his
                              power of transformation. He beguiled the hearer so
                              far from them, as to diminish them by distance, and
                              soften, if not entirely cast into shade, their too strong
                              natural colours. At this distance too, he had a better
                              opportunity of throwing upon them a false light, by an
                              apparently casual ray of refraction from other points in
                              the evidence, whose powers no man better knew how to
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1509"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="76"> </a></span>
                              array and concentrate, in order to disguise or eclipse an
                              obnoxious fact. It required a mind of uncommon
                              vigilance, and most intractable temper to resist this
                              charm with which he decoyed away his hearers; it
                              demanded a rapidity of penetration, which is rarely if
                              ever, to be found in the jury box, to detect the intellectual
                              juggle by which he spread his nets around them;
                              it called for a stubbornness and obduracy of soul which
                              does not exist, to sit unmoved under the pictures of
                              horror or of pity, which started from his canvass. They
                              might resolve if they pleased, to decide the cause against
                              him, and to disregard everything which he could urge
                              in the defence of his client. But it was all in vain.
                              Some feint in an unexpected direction, threw them off
                              their guard, and they were gone; some happy phrase,
                              burning from the soul, some image fresh from nature's
                              mint, and bearing her own beautiful and genuine impress,
                              struck them with delightful surprise, and melted
                              them into conciliation; and conciliation towards Mr.
                              Henry was victory inevitable. In short, he understood
                              the human character so perfectly; knew so well all its
                              strength and all its weaknesses, together with every
                              path and by-way which winds around to the citadel of
                              the best fortified heart and mind, that he never failed to
                              take them, either by stratagem or storm. Hence he
                              was, beyond doubt, the ablest defender of criminals in
                              Virginia, and will probably never be equalled again.

                           <p id="d145581e1512">It has been observed, that Mr. Henry's knowledge of
                              the common law was extremely defective; but his attendance
                              upon the general court was calculated to cure that
                              defect, in a considerable degree. All legal questions, of
                              magnitude or difficulty, came before that tribunal, either
                              originally, or by appeal, and he had continual opportunities
                              of hearing them discussed in the ablest manner,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1514"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="90" data-tei-n="77"> </a></span>
                              by the brightest luminaries of the American bar. His
                              was a mind on which nothing was lost; on which no
                              useful seed could be cast, without shooting into all the
                              luxuriance of which its nature was susceptible. Thus
                              improving every hint, and ramifying every principle
                              which was brought into his view, there is reason to
                              believe that a few years must have made him not only a
                              master of the general canons of property, but of the
                              modifications and exceptions of more frequent occurrence,
                              by which those canons are restrained and governed.
                              In support of this conclusion, I find that in January
                              1773, Robert C. Nicholas, who had enjoyed the first
                              practice at the bar, and who, by virtue of his office of
                              treasurer, was forced to relinquish that practice, committed,
                              by a public advertisement, his unfinished business
                              to Mr. Henry; a step which a man so remarkably
                              scrupulous in the discharge of every moral duty, would
                              not have taken, had there been any incompetency on
                              the part of his substitute.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1517">The British ministry, however, did not permit Mr.
                              Henry to waste himself in forensic exertions. The joy
                              of the Americans, on the repeal of the stamp act, was
                              very short-lived. That measure had not been, on the
                              part of the British parliament, a voluntary sacrifice to
                              truth and right. The ministry and their friends disavowed
                              this ground; and were forward, on every occasion,
                              to convince the colonies that they had nothing to expect,
                              either from the clemency or the magnanimity of
                              the British cabinet. Thus on a question of supplies for
                              the army in the session  of parliament of 1766-7, a
                              motion was made in the house of commons, that the
                              revenues arising and to

                              that brilliant political meteor, Charles Townsend,
                              urged, among other things, 
                              <hi id="d145581e1527" style="font-style: italic;">“the propriety of more
                                 troops being sent to America, and of their being quartered
                                 in the large towns.

                              authority of Great Britain, extended to every colony,

                              <hi id="d145581e1540" style="font-style: italic;">nonsense</hi>; and that he
                              voted for the repeal of the stamp act, not because it was

                                 the sentence, that the galleries might hear him; and after

                           <p id="d145581e1550">This temper soon manifested itself in open acts, and
                              turned the late joy of the colonies, into mourning.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1553">The first obnoxious measure was a stern demand of
                              satisfaction, from the legislatures of the colonies, for the
                              injuries which had been done to the stamp officers and
                              their adherents. The legislature of Massachusetts, of
                              whom this demand was first made, very respectfully,
                              and with good reason questioned the propriety and justice
                              of taxing the whole colony, for the excesses of a
                              few individuals, which they had neither prompted nor
                              armed; for the sake of peace however, and in the
                              spirit of accommodation that satisfaction was given; but
                              they annexed to their vote of satisfaction, a grant of
                              pardon to the rioters; and in England, according to the
                              usual courtesy of that country, nothing was said of the
                              satisfaction, while the pardon was treated as a most
                              insolent and impudent usurpation of the royal authority.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1556">The next step was that suggested by Mr. Townsend,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1558"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span>
                              of quartering large bodies of troops upon the chief towns
                              in the colonies, and demanding of the several colonial
                              legislatures, a provision for their comfortable support
                              and accommodation. A measure more replete with
                              exasperation could scarcely have been devised. The
                              very presence of those myrmidons was an insult; for it
                              was a direct reflection on the fidelity of the colonists.
                              Their object was perfectly understood: it was to curb
                              the just and honourable spirit of the people; to dragoon
                              them into submission to the parliamentary claim of
                              taxation, and reduce them to the condition of vassals,
                              governed by the right of conquest. The rudeness of the
                              soldiery too, was well calculated to keep up and
                              increase the irritation, which their presence alone would
                              have been sufficient to excite. In Boston, they were in
                              the habit of stopping the most respectable citizens in
                              the streets and compelling them to answer insulting
                              inquiries, or committing them to confinement on their
                              refusal, assigning, as the ground of their conduct, that
                              the town was a garrisoned town. In New York,
                              they provoked a contest with the people by making
                              war upon a liberty pole, which was the first object
                              of their earthly devotions, and which the soldiers continually
                              destroyed or attempted to destroy, as soon as it
                              could be replaced. And as if all this insult and humiliation
                              were not enough, the colonies were to be constrained
                              to tax themselves, to foster and cherish those instruments
                              of their degradation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1562">The legislature of New York, in a tone, at least
                              sufficiently submissive for the occasion, and on the false
                              ground of the inability of the colony, begged to be
                              excused from making the provision. For this high offence,
                              the legislative power of that colony was abolished by
                              act of parliament, until they should submit to make
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1564"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="93" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span>
                              the provision which was required: and they did submit.

                           <p id="d145581e1567">A body of British troops alleged to have been driven
                              by stress of weather into Boston, in the recess of the
                              colonial legislature, had been provided for out of the
                              public monies, by the governor and his council. The
                              legislature met shortly afterwards, and remonstrated
                              against this unconstitutional appropriation, with that
                              Roman firmness and dignity, which marked the character
                              of Massachusetts in every stage of the contest. But
                              governor Bernard, highly indignant at what he affected
                              to consider as presumption, made such a communication
                              upon the subject to the British court, as could have
                              had, and could have been designed to have no other
                              effect, than to widen the breach, and inflame more highly
                              those animosities, which already required no new aggravation.

                           <p id="d145581e1570">These military preparations were well understood to
                              be the harbingers of some unconstitutional act, the execution
                              of which they were necessary to enforce. Why
                              those preparations were restricted to the northern
                              states, and more particularly to Massachusetts, has never
                              been satisfactorily explained. There was no colony
                              which resisted, with more firmness and constancy, the
                              pretensions of the British parliament than that of Virginia;
                              yet no military force was thought necessary, during
                              the lives of the governors Fauquier and Bottetourt,
                              to keep down the spirit of rebellion in this colony. A
                              solution of the difficulty may perhaps be found, in the
                              character of the different governors. Virginia had the
                              good fortune, during this period, to be governed by enlightened
                              and amiable men, who saw and did justice to
                              the motives and measure of resistance which was
                              meditated; who were both able and willing to distinguish
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1572"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="81"> </a></span>
                              between reason and force, between remonstrance and
                              rebellion; who perceived with pleasure, the spirit of
                              genuine and unaffected loyalty and affection for the
                              parent country, which mingled itself with every complaint;
                              and who, in their communications to the British
                              court, were disposed rather “to extenuate,” than “to set
                              down aught in malice.” Whereas Bernard, the governor
                              of Massachusetts, was the fit instrument and apt
                              representative of the masters whom he served: for he had
                              all their pride and unfeeling insolence, and seems to
                              have enjoyed a kind of fiend-like pleasure, in rendering
                              his province hateful at home, by the most virulent
                              misrepresentations; and in drawing down upon her,
                              the accumulated curses and oppressions of the parent

                              of Parliament was passed, imposing certain duties on
                              glass, white and red lead, painters' colours, tea, and
                              paper imported into the colonies. This act was to take
                              effect on the 20th of November, 1767; and to ensure its
                              operation, another act authorized the king to appoint a
                              board of trade to reside in the colonies, and to instruct
                              them, at his pleasure and without limit, as to the mode
                              of executing their duties under this law. A commission

                              colonies, was the establishment of a board of admiralty,
                              with extensive powers, supported by large salaries
                              independent of the colonies, yet drawn from the revenues
                              compulsorily levied upon them; and the appointment,
                              also, of common law judges, to be paid by the crown
                              out of the revenues of the colony, and to hold their
                              offices during the king's pleasure.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1595">To all these outrages, the legislatures of the colonies
                              answered by petitions, memorials, remonstrances, and
                              letters, addressed to the friends of colonial liberty in
                              England; blending with the strongest professions of
                              loyalty, the expression of their hope, that those obnoxious
                              measures would be reconsidered and reversed, and the
                              colonies protected in their ancient and unalienable
                              rights. In reply, they received from the kindest of
                              their English friends, only exhortations to patience under
                              their sufferings; by the court party, menaces and
                              anathemas were brandished over their heads; and the
                              commissioners of the revenue, together with their auxiliaries,
                              the naval and military officers and soldiery, continued
                              to outrage and insult them, both in their persons and property.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1599">The people of Massachusetts, with the view of frustrating
                              the new revenue bill, entered into an association,
                              by which they bound themselves not to import from
                              Great Britain, or use any of the articles taxed; and
                              included in the resolution every article of British manufacture
                              which was not of the first and most indispensable
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1601"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="96" data-tei-n="83"> </a></span>
                              necessity. The legislature of that state also, resolved
                              on a circular letter to their sister colonies, inviting
                              their concurrence and co-operation towards procuring
                              relief, in a constitutional way, from the grievances
                              under which they were all suffering. This measure
                              having been reported by governor Bernard with
                              his usual embellishments, to the earl of Hilsborough,
                              the British minister for the American department, that
                              minister required the governor to demand of the legislature
                              an immediate recision of their resolution, on pain
                              of being forthwith dissolved. They refused to rescind,
                              and were dissolved accordingly. The same minister
                              also addressed a circular letter to the governors of the
                              other colonies, exhorting them to crush this correspondence
                              and concert amongst the colonial legislatures, in the
                              bud, by exacting from them an assurance that they
                              would not answer the circular of Massachusetts. They
                              refused to give such assurance, and were in their turn
                              dissolved.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1604">These violent measures however, produced an effect
                              very different from that which was expected to flow
                              from them. The dissolution of their legislatures swelled
                              the catalogue of their wrongs, and ministered additional
                              fuel to the resentments of the people. The non-importation
                              agreement became general; and, by means of
                              committees established in the several colonies, its execution
                              was guarded with a vigilance which could not be
                              eluded. A breach of it was infamy, inevitable and
                              unpardonable. Its observance was a badge of holdout by
                              which the patriot colonist was proud to be distinguished.
                              The privation was, indeed, in many respects severe;
                              but the sufferers were upheld by that kind of holy
                              fortitude, which enabled the Christian martyrs to smile
                              amidst the flames, and to triumph, even in the agonies of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1606"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="97" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span>
                              death. Every grade of society, all ages, and both sexes,
                              kindled in this sacred competition of patriotism. The
                              ladies of the colonies, in the dawn and throughout the
                              whole progress of the revolution, shone with pre-eminent
                              lustre in this war of fortitude and self-denial. They
                              renounced without a sigh, the use of the luxuries and
                              even of the comforts to which they had been accustomed;
                              and felt a nobler pride in appearing dressed in the
                              simple productions of their own looms, than they had
                              ever experienced from glittering in the brightest ornaments
                              of the east.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1609">The British court looked upon this trial of virtuous
                              fortitude, with surly and inexorable rigour. They seemed
                              determined to carry the point, at every hazard. The
                              sufferings of their own merchants and manufacturers
                              were forgotten, in the barbarous pleasure with which
                              they contemplated the sufferings of the colonists. It is
                              not in human nature to continue long to return good for
                              evil, affection for cruelty. The admiration and devotion
                              of the colonies for the parent country became gradually
                              weaker. This transition of feeling is most interestingly
                              marked in the chronicles of the day. The
                              epithets, “our kind and indulgent mother,” with which
                              she was wont to be greeted, were progressively changed
                              into “unnatural parent—cruel stepmother—proud, merciless
                              oppressor—haughty, unfeeling, and unrelenting
                              tyrant.” This state of feeling was aggravated by the
                              collisions which were perpetually occurring between idle
                              king's soldiery and the people of the towns in which
                              they were quartered. The streets of New York and of
                              Boston were the theatres of continual riots, ending
                              almost invariably in blood, and not unfrequently in death.
                              The newspapers of the day teem with the detail of
                              scenes of this sort; and from the effect which they
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1611"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="85"> </a></span>

                              very difficult to conceive what must have been their
                              operation on the people of that day, already goaded to
                              madness by previous injuries.

                              which led to the dismemberment of the British empire.
                              This is the function of the historian. My business is
                              only with Mr. Henry; and, for my purpose, nothing
                              more is necessary than to recal the general character
                              of the contest, for the purpose of showing the part which
                              he bore in it The revolution may be truly said to have
                              commenced with his resolutions in 1765. From that
                              period not an hour of settled peace had existed between
                              the two countries. It is true, that the eruption produced
                              by the stamp act, had subsided with its repeal; and the
                              people had resumed their ancient settlements and
                              occupations; but there was no peace of the heart or of the
                              mind. The rumbling of the volcano was still audible
                              and the smoke of the crater continually ascended,
                              mingled not unfrequently with those flames and masses
                              of ignited matter, which announced a new and more
                              terrible explosion.

                              and never, in any country or in any age, did there exist
                              a race of men, whose souls were better fitted to endure
                              the trial. Patient in sufficing, firm in adversity, calm
                              and collected amid the dangers which passed around
                              them, cool in council, and brave in battle, they were
                              worthy of the cause, and the cause was worthy of them.

                              the opposition to the stamp act, kept their high ground
                              during the whole of the ensuing contest. Mr. Henry,
                              having removed again from Louisa to his native county,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1622"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="99" data-tei-n="86"> </a></span>
                              in the year 1767 or 1768, continued a member of that
                              house, till the close of the revolution; and there could
                              be no want of boldness in any body, of which he was a
                              member. The session of 1768-9, was marked by a
                              set of resolutions so strong as to have excited even the
                              amiable and popular Bottetourt to displeasure. By
                              those resolutions they re-asserted, in the most emphatic
                              terms, the exclusive right of the colony to tax themselves
                              in all cases whatever; complained of the recent acts of
                              parliament, as so many violations of the British constitution;
                              and remonstrated vigorously, against the right of
                              transporting the free-born subjects of these colonies to
                              England, to take their trial before prejudiced tribunals,
                              for offences alleged to be committed in the colonies.
                              The tradition with regard to these resolutions, is, that
                              they were agreed to in a committee of the whole on
                              one day, but not reported to the house, with the view of
                              preventing their appearance on the journal of the next
                              day, before they could be completely passed through
                              the forms of the house; apprehending, from the fate of
                              the Massachusetts legislature, that a knowledge of these
                              resolutions on the part of the governor, would produce
                              an immediate dissolution of the house. When the house
                              rose for the evening, however, the fact of their having
                              passed such resolutions was whispered to the governor;
                              and he endeavoured in vain, to procure a copy of them
                              from the clerk.<a href="note41" class="ref-external" n="41" rend="sc"> *</a> On the next day, the house foreseeing

                              resolutions, considered, adopted, and ordered them to

                              dissolved.”

                              change the materials of which it had been composed. The
                              same members were re-elected without a single exception,
                              and the same determined spirit of resistance continued
                              to diffuse itself from the legislature over the colony
                              which they represented, and to animate by sympathy the
                              neighbouring colonies. This house had the merit of originating
                              that powerful engine of resistance, corresponding
                              committees between the legislatures of the different
                              colonies.<a href="note42" class="ref-external" n="42" rend="sc"> *</a> The measure was brought forward by Mr.
                              Dabney Carr, a new member from the county of Louisa,
                              in a committee of the whole house, on the 12th of March,
                              1773; and the resolutions, as adopted, now stood upon
                              the journals of the day, in the following terms:

                           <p id="d145581e1643">“Whereas the minds of his majesty's faithful subjects
                              in this colony have been much disturbed, by various
                              rumours, and reports of proceedings, tending to deprive
                              them of their ancient, legal, and constitutional rights.

                              neighbouring colonies; which renders a communication
                              of sentiments necessary; in order, therefore, to remove

                                    were so nearly coeval in the two states, as to render it impossible that either
                                    could have borrowed it from the other. The messengers, who bore the
                                    propositions from the two states, are said to have crossed each other on the
                                    way. This is Mr. Jefferson's account of it; and Mrs. Warren, in her very
                                    interesting history of the revolution, admits, that the measure was original
                                    on the part of Virginia. See the note to page 110, of her first volume.

                              <hi id="d145581e1680" style="font-style: italic;">debut</hi>, and a noble one it is said to have been. This
                              gentleman, by profession a lawyer, had recently
                              commenced his practice at the same bar with Patrick
                              Henry; and although he had not yet reached the meridian
                              of life, he was considered, by far the most formidable
                              rival in forensic eloquence that Mr. Henry had ever
                              yet had to encounter. He had the advantage of a person
                              at once dignified and engaging, and the manner and
                              action of an accomplished gentleman. His education
                              was a finished one; his mind trained to correct thinking;
                              his conceptions quick, and clear, and strong; he
                              reasoned with great cogency, and had an imagination
                              which enlightened beautifully, without interrupting or
                              diverting the course of his argument. His voice was
                              finely tuned, his feelings acute; his style free, and rich
                              and various; his devotion to the cause of liberty, verging
                              on enthusiasm; and his spirit firm and undaunted,
                              beyond the possibility of being shaken. With what
                              delight the house of burgesses hailed this new champion,
                              and felicitated themselves on such an accession to
                              their cause, it is easy to imagine. But what are the
                              hopes and expectations of mortals!

                                 and of the character of Mr. Carr, from one who knew him well, and heard
                                 this his first and last speech in the house of representatives. “I well remember
                                 the pleasure expressed in the countenance and conversation of the members,
                                 generally, on this 
                                 <hi id="d145581e1710" style="font-style: italic;">debut</hi> of Mr. Carr and the hopes they conceived, as
                                 well from the talents as the patriotism it manifested. But he died within
                                 two months after, and in him we lost a powerful fellow labourer. His character
                                 was of a high order: a spotless integrity, sound judgment, handsome
                                 imagination, enriched by education and reading, quick and clear in his conceptions,
                                 of correct and ready elocution, impressing every hearer with the
                                 sincerity of the heart from which it flowed. His firmness was inflexible in
                                 whatever he thought right: but when no moral principle was in the way,
                                 never had man more of the milk of human kindness, of indulgence, of softness,
                                 of pleasantry in conversation and conduct. The number of his friends
                                 and the warmth of their affection, were proofs of his worth and of their
                                 estimate of it. To give to those now living an idea of the affliction produced by
                                 his death, in the minds of all those who knew him, I liken it to that lately
                                 felt by themselves on the death of his eldest son, Peter Carr; so like him
                                 in all his endowments and moral qualities, and whose recollection can
                                 never recur, without a deep drawn sigh from the bosom of every one who
                                 knew him.”

                                          when occasion offered, displayed a masculine eloquence, and an undaunted
                                          love of liberty.”

                           <p id="d145581e1732">Mr. Carr's resolutions were supported, successively
                              by Mr. Henry, and Mr. Richard Henry Lee, with their
                              usual ability. The reader will no doubt be gratified by
                              a short sketch of this assembly, as it presented itself to a
                              gentleman who now saw it for the first time, and who
                              looked upon it with an eye of taste and genius; the
                              writer who was then in the ardour of youth, and a
                              stranger in the colony, has since been distinguished by
                              holding and adorning some of the highest offices of the state.

                           <p id="d145581e1735">“When I first saw Mr. Henry, which was in March,
                              1773, he wore a peach blossom coloured coat, and a
                              dark wig, which tied behind, and I believe a bag to it,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1737"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="91"> </a></span>
                              as was the fashion of the day. When pointed out to
                              me, as the orator of the assembly, I looked at him
                              with no great prepossession. On the opposite side
                              of the house sat the graceful Pendleton, and the harmonious
                              Richard Henry Lee, whose aquiline nose and Roman
                              profile, struck me much more forcibly than that of
                              Mr. Henry, his rival in eloquence. The distance from
                              the gallery to the chair, near which these distinguished
                              members sat, did not permit me to have such a view of
                              their features and countenances, as to leave a strong
                              impression, except of Mr. Lee's, whose profile was too
                              remarkable not to have been noticed at an even greater
                              distance. I was then between nineteen and twenty, had
                              never heard a speech in public, except from the pulpit
                              —had attached to the idea I had formed of an orator,
                              all the advantages of person which Mr. Pendleton
                              possessed, and even more all the advantages of voice,
                              which delighted me so much in the speeches of Mr.
                              Lee—the fine polish of language, which that gentleman
                              united with that harmonious voice, so as to make me
                              sometimes fancy, that I was listening to some being
                              inspired with more than mortal powers of embellishment,
                              and all the advantages of gesture which the celebrated
                              Demosthenes considered as the first, second, and third
                              qualifications of an orator. I discovered neither of
                              these qualifications in the appearance of Mr. Henry, or
                              in the few remarks I heard him deliver during the session.
                              It was at this time that Mr. Dabney Carr made a
                              motion for appointing a standing committee of
                              correspondence with the other colonies. I was not present
                              when Mr. Henry spoke on this question; but was told
                              by some of my fellow collegians, that he far exceeded Mr.
                              Lee, whose speech succeeded the next day. Never
                              before had I heard what I thought oratory; and if his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1739"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="105" data-tei-n="92"> </a></span>
                              speech was excelled by Mr. Henry's, the latter must
                              have been excellent indeed. This was the only subject
                              that I recollect, which called forth the talents of the
                              members during that session, and there was too much
                              unanimity to have elicited all the strength of any one of them.”

                           <p id="d145581e1742">My correspondent had an opportunity of seeing Mr.
                              Henry not long afterwards, when speaking on a subject
                              of the highest moment to the liberties of his country,
                              and of witnessing that almost supernatural transformation
                              of appearance, which has been already noticed as
                              being invariably wrought by the excitement of his genius.
                              We shall have his own account of it by and by;
                              and shall see, that 
                              <hi id="d145581e1744" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> no longer formed an exception to
                              the voice of his country, in assigning the palm of popular
                              eloquence to this most rare and extraordinary favourite
                              of nature.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e1748">It is not improbable, as it has been suggested, that
                              the strongly marked distinctions of ranks which prevailed
                              in this country, and the resentment, if not envy, with
                              which the poorer classes looked up to the splendour and
                              ostentation of the landed aristocracy, had a considerable
                              agency in inflaming Mr. Henry's hostility to the British
                              court. He probably regarded the untitled nobles
                              of Virginia, as a sort of spurious emanation from the
                              royal stock; connected them in his resentments, and
                              transferred from the effect to the cause the larger stream
                              of his indignation. He had a rooted aversion and even
                              abhorrence to every thing in the shape of pride, cruelty,
                              and tyranny; and could not tolerate that social inequality
                              from which they proceeded, and by which they
                              were nourished. The principle which he seems to have
                              brought with him into the world, and which certainly
                              formed the guide of all his public actions, was, that the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1750"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="93"> </a></span>
                              whole human race was one family, equal in their rights
                              and their birth-right liberty.

                           <p id="d145581e1754">The elements of his character were most happily
                              mingled for the great struggle which was now coming
                              on. His views were not less steady than they were
                              bold. His vision pierced deeply into futurity; and long
                              before a whisper of independence had been heard in this
                              land, he had looked through the whole of the approaching
                              contest, and saw, with the eye and the rapture of a
                              prophet, his country seated aloft among the nations of the
                              earth. A striking proof of this prescience, is given in an
                              anecdote communicated to me by Mr. Pope. These are
                              his words: “I am informed by col. John Overton, that
                              before one drop of blood was shed in our contest with
                              Great Britain, he was at col. Samuel Overton's, in
                              company with Mr. Henry, col. Morris, John Hawkins, and
                              col. Samuel Overton, when the last mentioned gentleman
                              asked Mr. Henry, ‘whether he supposed Great
                              Britain would drive her colonies to extremities? And
                              if she should, what he thought would be the issue of the
                              war?’ When Mr. Henry, after looking round to see
                              who were present, expressed himself confidentially to
                              the company in the following manner. ‘She 
                              <hi id="d145581e1756" style="font-style: italic;">will</hi>
                              drive us to extremities—no accommodation 
                              <hi id="d145581e1759" style="font-style: italic;">will</hi> take
                              place—hostilities will

                              desperate and bloody touch it will be.’ ‘But,’ said col.
                              Samuel Overton, ‘do you think, Mr. Henry, that an
                              infant nation as we are, without discipline, arms,
                              ammunition, ships of war, or money to procure them—
                              do you think it possible, thus circumstanced, to oppose
                              successfully the fleets and armies of Great Britain?’ ‘I
                              will be candid with you,’ replied Mr. Henry. ‘I doubt
                              whether we 
                              <hi id="d145581e1765" style="font-style: italic;">shall</hi> be able,

                              a nation. But,’ continued he, (rising from his chair
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e1772"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="107" data-tei-n="94"> </a></span>

                              Great Britain—Where will they be, all this while? Do
                              you suppose they will stand by, idle and indifferent
                              spectators of the contest? Will Louis the XVI. be asleep

                              with arms, ammunition, and clothing; and not with
                              these only, but he will send his fleets and armies to fight
                              our battles for us; he will form with us a treaty offensive
                              and defensive, against our unnatural mother. Spain
                              and Holland will join the confederation! Our independence
                              will be established! and we shall take our
                              stand among the nations of the earth!’ Here he ceased;
                              and col. John Overton says, he shall never forget the
                              voice and prophetic manner with which these predictions
                              were uttered, and which have been since so literally
                              verified. Col. Overton says, at the word 
                              <hi id="d145581e1780" style="font-style: italic;">independence</hi>,
                              the company appeared to be startled; for they
                              had never heard any thing of the kind before even suggested.”

                                       of this country, having been deprived by the sudden
                                       interposition of the executive part of this government,
                                       from giving our countrymen the advice we wished to

                                       under the hard necessity of adopting this, the only
                                       method we have left, of pointing out to our countrymen,
                                       such measures as, in our opinion, are best fitted to
                                       secure our dear rights and liberty from destruction, by
                                       the heavy hand of power now lifted against North
                                       America. With much grief, we find that our dutiful
                                       applications to Great Britain for the security of our just,
                                       ancient, and constitutional rights, have been not only
                                       disregarded, but that a determined system is formed and
                                       pressed, for reducing the inhabitants of British America
                                       to slavery, by subjecting them to the payment of taxes,
                                       imposed without the consent of the people or their
                                       representatives; and that, in pursuit of this system, we
                                       find an act of the British parliament, lately passed, for
                                       stopping the harbour and commerce of the town of
                                       Boston, in our sister colony of Massachusetts Bay,
                                       until the people there submit to the payment of such
                                       unconstitutional taxes; and which act most violently

                                       and arbitrarily deprives them of their property, in
                                       wharves erected by private persons, at their own great
                                       and proper expense; which act is, in our opinion, a most
                                       dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty
                                       and rights of all North America. It is further our
                                       opinion, that as tea, on its importation into America, is
                                       charged with a duty imposed by parliament, for the purpose
                                       of raising a revenue without the consent of the
                                       people, it ought not to be used by any person who wishes
                                       well to the constitutional rights and liberties of British
                                       America. And whereas the India company have
                                       ungenerously attempted the ruin of America, by sending
                                       many ships loaded with tea into the colonies, thereby
                                       intending to fix a precedent in favour of arbitrary taxation,
                                       we deem it highly proper and do accordingly recommend
                                       it strongly to our countrymen, not to purchase
                                       or use any kind of East India commodity whatsoever,
                                       except saltpetre and spices, until the grievances
                                       of America are redressed. We are further clearly of
                                       opinion, that an attack made on one of our sister colonies,
                                       to compel submission to arbitrary taxes, is an attack
                                       made on all British America, and threatens ruin to the
                                       rights of all, unless the united wisdom of the whole be
                                       applied.

                              body, the old continental congress of the United States
                              (towards whom every American heart will bow with
                              pious homage, while the name of liberty shall be dear
                              in our land) met for the first time, at Carpenter's Hall,
                              in the city of Philadelphia. Peyton Randolph, of Virginia,
                              was chosen president, and the house was organized
                              for business, with all the solemnities of a regular legislature.<a href="note45" class="ref-external" n="45" rend="sc"> *</a>

                              now for the first time, brought together. They were
                              known to each other by fame; but they were personally
                              strangers. The meeting was awfully solemn. The
                              object which had called them together, was of incalculable
                              magnitude. The liberties of no less than three
                              millions of people, with that of all their posterity, were
                              staked on the wisdom and energy of their councils.

                              No wonder, then, at the long and deep silence which
                              is said to have followed upon their organization; at the
                              anxiety with which the mentors looked around upon
                              each other; and the reluctance which every individual
                              felt to open a business so fearfully momentous. In the
                              midst of this deep and death-like silence, and just
                              when it was beginning to become painfully embarrassing,
                              Mr. Henry arose slowly, as if borne down by the
                              weight of the subject. After faultering, according to
                              his habit, through a most inexpressive exordium, in which
                              he merely echoed back the consciousness of every
                              other heart, in deploring his inability to do justice to
                              the occasion, he launched gradually, into a recital of
                              the colonial wrongs. Rising, as he advanced, with the
                              grandeur of his subject, and glowing at length, with all
                              the majesty and excitation of the occasion, his speech
                              seemed more than that of mortal man. Even those
                              who had heard him in all his glory, in the house of
                              burgesses of Virgrinia, were astonished at the manner
                              in which his talents seemed to swell and expand themselves,
                              to fill the vaster theatre in which he was now
                              placed. There was no rant—no rhapsody—no labour of
                              the understanding—no straining of the voice—no confusion
                              of the utterance. His countenance was erect—his
                              eye steady—his action, noble—his enunciation clear and
                              firm—his mind poised on its centre—his views of his
                              subject comprehensive and great—and his imagination,
                              corruscating with a magnificence and a variety, which
                              struck even that assembly with amazement and awe.
                              He sat down amidst murmurs of astonishment and
                              applause; and as he had been before proclaimed the
                              greatest orator of Virginia, he was now on every hand,
                              admitted to be the first orator of America.

                              charmed the house with a different kind of eloquence—
                              chaste—classical—beautiful—his polished periods rolling
                              along without effort, filling the ear with the most
                              bewitching harmony, and delighting the mind with the
                              most exquisite imagery. The cultivated graces of Mr.
                              Lee's rhetoric received and at the same time reflected
                              beauty, by their contrast with the wild and grand effusions
                              of Mr Henry. Just as those noble monuments of

                              before been pronounced the Demosthenes, it was
                              conceded on every hand, that Mr. Lee was the Cicero of

                              were the topic, they took the undisputed lead in the

                              designated by his committee, to draw the petition to the
                              king, with which they were charged; and Mr. Lee was
                              charged with the address to the people of England.
                              The last was first reported. On reading it, great
                              disappointment was expressed in every countenance, and
                              a dead silence ensued for some minutes. At length it
                              was laid on the table, for perusal and consideration, till
                              the next day: when first one member and then another
                              arose, and paying some faint compliment to the composition,
                              observed that there were still certain considerations
                              not expressed, which should properly find a place
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2063"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="109"> </a></span>
                              in it. The address was, therefore, committed for
                              amendment; and one prepared by Mr. Jay, and offered
                              by governor Livingston, was reported and adopted, with
                              scarcely an alteration. These facts are stated by a gentleman
                              to whom they were communicated by Mr. Pendleton
                              and Mr. Harrison, of the Virginia delegation, (except
                              that Mr. Harrison erroneously ascribed the draught
                              to governor Livingston,) and to whom they were afterwards
                              confirmed by governor Livingston himself. Mr.

                                    two gentlemen had made their first speeches, Mr. Chase, a delegate from
                                    Maryland, walked across the house to the seat of his colleague, and said to

                              the same individual; and the rarity of the occurrence
                              has led to an opinion, that those talents depend on
                              constitutions of mind so widely different, as to render their
                              union almost wholly unattainable. This was not the
                              opinion, however, it is believed, at Athens and at Rome:
                              it cannot I apprehend, be the opinion, either, in the
                              united kingdom of Great Britain. There have been,
                              indeed, in these countries distinguished orators, who
                              have not left behind them any proofs of their eminence
                              in composition; but neither have they left behind them
                              any proofs of their failure in this respect; so that

                              than established. On the other hand, there
                              have been, in all those countries, too many illustrious
                              exampes of the union of those talents, to justify
                              the belief of their incongruity by any general law of nature.

                           <p id="d145581e2090">That there have been many eminent writers who,
                              from physical defects, could never have become orators,
                              is very certain: but is the converse of the proposition
                              equally true? Was there ever an eminent orator who
                              might not, by proper discipline, have become, also, a
                              very eminent writer? What are the essential qualities of
                              the orator? Are they not judgment, invention, imagination,
                              sensibility, taste and expression, or the command
                              of strong and appropriate language? If these be the
                              qualities of the orator, it is very easy to understand how
                              they may be improved by the discipline of the closet;<a href="note47" class="ref-external" n="47" rend="sc"> *</a>

                              will tame too much the fiery spirit, the enchanting wildness
                              and magnificent irregularity of the orator's genius?
                              The example of Demosthenes alone, is a sufficient
                              answer to this question; and the reader will, at
                              once, recal numerous other examples, corroborative of
                              the same truth, both in ancient and modern times. The
                              truth seems to be, that this rare union of talents results
                              not from any incongruity in their nature, but from
                              defective education, taking this word in its larger, Roman
                              sense. If the genius of the orator, has been properly
                              trained in his youth to both pursuits, instead of being
                              injured, it will, I apprehend, be found to derive additional
                              grace, beauty, and even sublimity, from the discipline.
                              His flights will be at least as bold—they will
                              be better sustained—and whether he chooses to descend
                              in majestic circles, or to stoop on headlong wing, his
                              performance will not be the worse for having been
                              taught to fly.

                              youth had been wasted in idleness. He had become

                                    not less just than it is beautiful. After having spoken of Galba, as one of those
                                    men of great but less cultivated natural powers, who were afraid of lowering
                                    the fame of their eloquence by submitting their writings to the world, he
                                    proceeds thus:—

                                    </hi> BRUTUS, xxiv. 93. There seems to have been
                                    a strong resemblance between the structure of Galba's eloquence and character,
                                    and those of Mr. Henry. In their habits however, there was this striking
                                    difference; that Galba's preparation for speaking was always most elaborate;
                                    Mr. Henry's generally none at all. On this head, of Galba's anxious preparation,
                                    Cicero gives us a very interesting anecdote. Laelius, it seems, was engaged
                                    in a great cause, in which he spoke with the peculiar elegance which
                                    always distiguished him; but not having succeeded in convincing his judges,
                                    the case was adjourned to another day, and a new argument was called for.
                                    Laelius again appeared, and surpassed his former exertions, but with the
                                    same result of another adjournment and a call for re-argument. His clients
                                    attended him to his house on the rising of the court, expressed their gratitude
                                    in the strongest terms, and begged that he would not permit himself
                                    to be wearied into a desertion of them. To this Laelius answered, that what
                                    he had done for the support of the cause, had, indeed, been diligently and
                                    accurately performed; but he was satisfied that that cause could be better
                                    defended by the more bold and vehement eloquence of Galba. Galba was
                                    accordingly applied to; but was, at first, startled at the idea of succeeding
                                    such an orator as Laelius; in any cause: more especially, on the short time for
                                    preparation that was then allowed him. He yielded, however, to their importunities;
                                    and employed the whole of the intermediate day and the morning
                                    of that in which the court was to sit, in studying and annotating, with the
                                    help of his amanuenses. When the hour of court arrived, his clients called
                                    for him, and Galba remarked, “with that complexion and those eyes,” says Cicero “which
                                    would have led you to suppose that he had been engaged in
                                    pleading a cause and not studying it.” Whence it appears that Galba
                                    was not less vehement and inflamed in meditating than in the act of delivering
                                    a speech. His success was proportioned to his preparation. “In the
                                    midst of the greatest expectation, surrounded by a vast concourse of hearers,
                                    before Laelius himself, he plead the cause with so much force and so much
                                    power, that no part of his speech passed without applause, and his clients
                                    were discharged, with the approbation of every one.” What an impression
                                    does this give us of the magnanimity of Laelius, as well as the abilities of
                                    Galba! Mr. Henry would not have taken the trouble of Galba's preparation;
                                    but he would have gained the cause, if human abilities could have gained it.

                              not impossible that, for the times in which he lived, and
                              for the more immediate purpose of the American revolution,
                              the popular opinion may be correct. The people
                              seem to have admired him the more for his want of
                              discipline. “His genius,” they say, “was unbroken,
                              and too full of fire to bear the curb of composition. He
                              delighted to swim the flood, to breast the torrent, and to
                              scale the mountain: and supported as he was, in all public
                              bodies, by masters of the pen, they insist, that it was
                              even fortunate for the revolution, that 
                              <hi id="d145581e2131" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> genius was
                              left at large, to revel in all the wildness and boldness of
                              nature; that it enabled him to infuse, more successfully,
                              his own intrepid spirit into the measures of the revolution;
                              that it rendered his courage more contagious, and
                              enabled him to achieve, by a kind of happy rashness,
                              what perhaps, had been lost by a better regulated mind.”

                              and Mr. Henry returned to his native county.
                              Here, as was natural, he was surrounded by his neighbours,
                              who were eager to hear not only what had been
                              done, but what kind of men had composed that illustrious
                              body. He answered their enquiries with all his
                              wonted kindness and candour; and having been asked
                              by one of them, “whom he thought the greatest man in
                              congress,” he replied—“If you speak of eloquence,
                              Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina, is by far the greatest
                              orator; but if you speak of solid information and sound
                              judgment, colonel Washington, is unquestionably, the
                              greatest man on that floor.” Such was the penetration
                              which, at that early period of Mr. Washington's life,
                              could pierce through his retiring modesty and habitual
                              reserve; and estimate so correctly, the unrivalled worth
                              of his character.

                           <p id="d145581e2141">On Monday, the 20th of March, 1775, the convention
                              of delegates from the several counties and corporations
                              of Virginia, met for the second time. This assembly
                              was held in the old church in the town of Richmond.
                              Mr. Henry was a member of that body also.
                              The reader will bear in mind the tone of the instructions
                              given by the convention of the preceding year to
                              their deputies in congress. He will remember, that
                              while they recite with great feeling, the series of grievances
                              under which the colonies had laboured, and insist
                              with firmness on their constitutional rights, they
                              give nevertheless, the most explicit and solemn pledge
                              of their faith and true allegiance to his majesty king
                              George the III. and avow their determination to support
                              him with their lives and fortunes, in the legal exercise
                              of all his just rights and prerogatives. He will
                              remember, that these instructions contain, also, an
                              expression of their sincere approbation of a connexion
                              with Great Britain, and of their ardent wishes for a
                              return of that friendly intercourse, from which this
                              country had derived so much prosperity and happiness.
                              These sentiments still influenced many of the leading
                              members of the convention of 1775. They could not
                              part with the fond hope, that those peaceful days would
                              again return, which had shed so much light and warmth
                              over the land; and the report of the king's gracious
                              reception of the petition from congress, tended to cherish
                              and foster that hope, and to render them averse to
                              any measure of violence. But Mr. Henry saw things
                              with a steadier eye and a deeper insight. His judgment
                              was too solid to be duped by appearances; and his heart
                              too firm and manly to be amused by false and flattering
                              hopes. He had long since read the true character of
                              the British court; and saw that no alternative remained
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2143"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="128" data-tei-n="115"> </a></span>
                              for his country but abject submission or heroic resistance.
                              It was not for a soul like Henry's to hesitate between
                              these courses. He had offered upon the altar of
                              liberty no divided heart. The gulf of war which yawned
                              before him, was indeed fiery and fearful; but he saw
                              that the awful plunge was inevitable. The body of the
                              convention however, hesitated. They cast around “a
                              longing lingering look” on those flowery fields, on
                              which peace, and ease, and joy, were still sporting; and
                              it required all the energies of a Mentor like Henry, to
                              push them from the precipice, and conduct them over
                              the stormy sea of the revolution, to liberty and glory.

                           <p id="d145581e2146">The convention being formed and organized for business,
                              proceeded, in the first place, to express their unqualified
                              approbation of the measures of congress, and
                              to declare, that they considered “this whole continent
                              as under the highest obligations to that respectable body,
                              for the wisdom of their counsels, and their unremitted
                              endeavours to maintain and preserve inviolate the just
                              rights and liberties of his majesty's dutiful and loyal

                              were due, and that this just tribute of applause be
                              presented to the worthy delegates, deputed by a former

                              for their cheerful undertaking and faithful discharge of
                              the very important trust reposed in them.”

                           <p id="d145581e2152">The morning of the 23d March was opened, by
                              reading a petition and memorial from the assembly of
                              Jamaica to the king's most excellent majesty: whereupon
                              it was “resolved, that the unfeigned thanks and
                              most grateful acknowledgments of the convention be
                              presented to that very respectable assembly, for the

                              exceeding generous and affectionate part they have so
                              nobly taken, in the unhappy contest between Great
                              Britain and her colonies; and for their truly patriotic
                              endeavours to fix the just claims of the colonists upon the
                              most permanent constitutional principles:—that the assembly
                              be assured, that it is the most ardent wish of this
                              colony (and they were persuaded of the whole continent
                              of North America) to see a speedy return of those
                              halcyon days, when we lived a free and happy people.”

                              Mr. Henry; on the contrary, they were “gall and

                              up to a bolder tone. He rose, therefore, and moved
                              the following manly resolutions:

                              It was almost general. The resolutions were opposed
                              as not only rash in policy, but as harsh and well
                              nigh impious in point of feeling. Some of the warmest
                              patriots of the convention opposed them. Richard
                              Bland, Benjamin Harrison, and Edmund Pendleton,
                              who had so lately drunk of the fountain of patriotism
                              in the continental congress, and Robert C. Nicholas,
                              one of the best as well as ablest men and patriots in
                              the state, resisted them with all their influence and abilities.

                              congressional petition by the throne. They insisted that
                              national comity, and much more filial respect, demanded
                              the exercise of a more dignified patience. That the
                              sympathies of the parent country were now on our side.

                              were still with us, and had, as yet, had no cause to blush
                              for our indiscretion. That the manufacturing interests
                              of Great Britain, already smarting under the effects of
                              our non-importation, co-operated powerfully towards
                              our relief. That the sovereign himself had relented,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2189"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="118"> </a></span>
                              and showed that he looked upon our sufferings with an
                              eye of pity. “Was this a moment,” they asked, “to disgust
                              our friends, to extinguish all the conspiring sympathies
                              which were working in our favour; to turn their friendship
                              into hatred, their pity into revenge? And what was
                              there, they asked, in the situation of the colony, to
                              tempt us to this? Were we a great military people?
                              Were we ready for war? Where were our stores—
                              where were our arms—where our soldiers—where our
                              generals—where our money, the sinews of war? They
                              were no where to be found. In truth, we were poor—
                              we were naked—we were defenceless. And yet we
                              talk of assuming the front of war! of assuming it too,
                              against a nation, one of the most formidable in the world!
                              A nation ready and armed at all points! Her navies
                              riding triumphant in every sea; her armies never marching
                              but to certain victory! What was to be the issue
                              of the struggle we were called upon to court? What

                              which he was so invariably distinguished. “No man,”
                              he said, “thought more highly than he did, of the
                              patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy

                              The question before the house was one of awful moment
                              to this country. For his own part, he considered
                              it as nothing less than a question of freedom or
                              slavery. And in proportion to the magnitude of the
                              subject, ought to be the freedom of the debate. It was
                              only in this way that they could hope to arrive at truth,
                              and fulfil the great responsibility which they held to
                              God and their country. Should he keep back his
                              opinions, at such a time, through fear of giving offence,
                              he should consider himself as guilty of treason towards
                              his country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the majesty
                              of Heaven, which he revered above all earthly kings.”

                              to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown
                              ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must
                              be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive

                              subjugation—the last arguments to which kings resort.
                              I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if
                              its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen
                              assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great

                              for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir:
                              she has none. They are meant for us: they can be
                              meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and

                              have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose
                              to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have
                              been trying that for the last ten years. Have we any
                              thing new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have

                              but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty

                              which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I
                              beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we
                              have done every thing that could be done, to avert the

                              slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional
                              violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;
                              and we have been spurned, with contempt,
                              from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things,
                              may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.

                                    the profane Gauls, who, at first, were awed by their presence, as if they had

                              shall have bound us, hand and foot? Sir, we are not
                              weak, if we make a proper use of those means which
                              the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three
                              millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty,
                              and in such a country as that which we possess, are
                              invincible by any force which our enemy can send against
                              us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.
                              There is a just God who presides over the destinies of
                              nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles
                              for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone;
                              it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir,
                              we have no election. If we were base enough to desire
                              it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There
                              is no retreat, but in submission and slavery! Our chains
                              are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains

                              the north, will bring to our ears the clash of resounding
                              arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand

                              several members started from their seats. The cry, “to

                              high. That supernatural voice still sounded in their
                              ears, and shivered along their arteries. They heard, in
                              every pause, the cry of liberty or death. They became

                                 impressive account of this debate. Since these sheets were prepared for
                                 the press, and at the moment of their departure from the hands of the
                                 author, he has received from chief justice Marshall, a note in relation to the
                                 same debate, which he thinks too interesting to suppress. It is the substance
                                 of a statement made to the chief justice (then an ardent youth, feeling a
                                 most enthusiastic admiration of eloquence, and panting for war) by his
                                 father, who was a member of this convention. Mr. Marshall, (the father,)
                                 after speaking of Mr. Henry's speech “as one of the most bold, vehement,
                                 and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered,” proceeded
                                 to state, that “he was followed by Mr. Richard H. Lee, who took a most
                                 interesting view of our real situation. He stated the force which Britain could
                                 probably bring to bear upon us, and reviewed our resources and means of
                                 resistance. He stated the advantages and disadvantages of both parties, and
                                 drew from this statement, auspicious inferences. But he concluded with
                                 saying, admitting the probable calculations to be against us, ‘we are assured

                                 resistance, at this particular point of time) was, nevertheless, one of the

                                 as the measure of resistance was carried, in order to give to it the greatest
                                 effect, he rose and moved to change the system; and, instead of arming
                                 the militia, to raise ten thousand regulars for the war; but the motion was

                              whom I went in all points. Sensible, however, of the
                              importance of unanimity among our constituents,
                              although we often wished to have gone on faster, we
                              slackened our pace, that our less ardent colleagues might
                              keep up with us; and they on their part differing nothing
                              from us in principle, quickened their gait somewhat
                              beyond that which their prudence might, of itself, have
                              advised, and thus consolidated the phalanx which
                              breasted the power of Britain. By this harmony of the
                              bold with the cautious, we advanced, with our constituents,
                              in undivided mass, and with fewer examples of
                              separation than, perhaps, existed in any other part of
                              the union.”

                              the alert and enquiring spirit of Mr. Henry laid hold of
                              another instance of royal misrule. Governor Dunmore
                              it seems, by a recent proclamation, had declared, that
                              his majesty had given orders, for all vacant lands
                              within this colony to be put up in lots at public
                              sale; and that the highest bidder for such lots should
                              be the purchaser thereof, and should hold the same,
                              subject to a reservation of one halfpenny 
                              <hi id="d145581e2360" style="font-style: italic;">per</hi> acre, by
                              way of annual quit-rent, and of all mines of gold, silver,
                              and precious stones. These terms were deemed
                              an innovation on the established usage of granting lands
                              in this colony; and this sagacious politician saw in the
                              proceeding, not only an usurpation of power, but a
                              great subduction of the natural wealth of the colony,
                              and the creation, moreover, of a separate band of
                              tenants and retainers, devoted to the vilest measures of
                              the crown. With a view therefore, to defeat this measure,
                              he moved the following resolution, which was adopted:

                              thereof to the next general assembly or convention; and

                                 their utmost endeavours to prevent any such appointment of deputies,
                                 and to exhort all persons whatever within this government, to desist
                                 from such an unjustifiable proceeding, so highly displeasing to his majesty.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e2396">This proclamation was published while the convention was in session,
                                 and was obviously designed to have an effect on their proceedings.
                                 It passed by them, however, “as the idle wind which they regarded not.”
                                 The age of proclamations was gone, and the glory of regal governors
                                 pretty nearly extinguished forever.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e2399">It ought not to be omitted, however, that this very convention passed resolutions
                                 complimentary to lord Dunmore, and the troops which he had
                                 commanded in an expedition of the preceding year against the Indians: a
                                 compliment which, as we shall see, was afterwards found to be unmerited. As
                                 the resolution in regard to lord Dunmore does honour to the candour of the
                                 convention, and shows also how little personality there was in the contest, I
                                 take leave to subjoin it.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e2402">“Resolved, 
                                 <hi id="d145581e2404" style="font-style: italic;">unanimously</hi>, That the most cordial thanks of the people of
                                 this colony, are a tribute justly due to our worthy governor, lord Dunmore,
                                 for his truly noble, wise and spirited conduct, on the late expedition against
                                 our Indian enemy—a conduct which at once evinces his excellency's
                                 attention to the true interests of this colony, and a zeal in the executive department
                                 which no dangers can divert, or difficulties hinder, from achieving the most
                                 important services to the people who have the happiness to live under his
                                 administration.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e2409">Lord Dunmore was not a man of popular manners; he had nothing of the
                                 mildness, the purity, the benevolence and suavity of his predecessor. On
                                 the contrary, he is represented as having been rude and offensive: coarse
                                 in his figure, his countenance and his manners. Yet he received from the
                                 house of burgesses, the most marked respect. Thus in 1774, while the
                                 liberties of the colonies were bleeding at every pore, and while the house
                                 was smarting severely, under the recent news of the occlusion of the port
                                 of Boston, they paid to lady Dunmore, who had just arrived at Williamsburg,
                                 the most cordial and elegant attentions, congratulated his lordship on
                                 this increase to his domestic felicity; and even, after their abrupt
                                 dissolution, complimented the inhabitants of the palace with a splendid ball
                                 and entertainment, in honour of the arrival of the countess Dunmore and
                                 her family.

                           <p id="d145581e2422">THE storm of the revolution now began to thicken.
                              The cloud of war had actually burst on the New
                              England states, while as yet the middle and southern
                              colonies were in comparative repose. The calm, however,
                              was deceitful, and of short duration; and, so far as Virginia
                              was concerned, had been occasioned rather by
                              the absence of governor Dunmore on an Indian expedition,
                              than any disposition on his part to favour the colony.
                              His return to Williamsburg was the signal for violence.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2425"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="144" data-tei-n="131"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2427">It seems to have been a matter of concert among the
                              colonial governors, if indeed the policy was not dictated
                              by the British court, to disarm the people of all
                              the colonies at one and the same time, and thus
                              incapacitate them for resistance in concert.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2431">To give effect to this measure, the export of powder
                              from Great Britain was prohibited: and an attempt was
                              generally made about the same period, to seize the powder
                              and arms in the several provincial magazines. Gage,
                              the successor of Hutchinson in the government of
                              Massachusetts, set the example, by a seizure of the ammunition
                              and military stores at Cambridge, and the powder in
                              the magazines at Charlestown and other places. His example
                              was followed by similar attempts in other colonies
                              to the north. And on Thursday, the 20th of April, 1775,
                              captain Henry Collins, of the armed schooner Magdalen,
                              then lying at Burwell's ferry, on James river, came
                              up at the head of a body of marines, and, acting
                              under the orders of lord Dunmore, entered the city of
                              Williamsburg in the dead of the night, and carried off
                              from the public magazine, about twenty barrels of powder,
                              which he placed on board his schooner before the
                              break of day. Clandestine as the movement had been,
                              the alarm was given to the inhabitants early on the next
                              morning. Their exasperation may be easily conceived.
                              The town was in tumult. A considerable body of them
                              flew to arms, with the determination to compel capt.
                              Collins to restore the powder. With much difficulty,
                              however, they were restrained by the graver inhabitants
                              of the town, and by the members of the common council,
                              who assured them that proper measures should be
                              immediately used to produce a restoration of the powder,
                              without the effusions of human blood. The council
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2433"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="145" data-tei-n="132"> </a></span>
                              therefore met in their corporate character, and addressed
                              the following letter to governor Dunmore.

                                       as peculiar and critical. The inhabitants, from
                                       the situation of the magazine in the midst of their city,
                                       have for a long tract of time, been exposed to all those
                                       dangers which have happened in many countries from
                                       explosions, and other accidents. They have, from time
                                       to time, thought it incumbent on them to guard the
                                       magazine. For their security they have, for some time
                                       past, judged it necessary to keep strong patrols on foot:

                                       but be extremely alarming.

                              he was surprised to hear the people were under arms

                              prudent to put powder into their hands, in such a situation.”

                           <p id="d145581e2483">This conditional promise of the return of the powder,
                              supported by the influence of Mr. Peyton Randolph,
                              Mr. Robert C. Nicholas, and other characters of
                              weight, had the effect, it seems, of quieting the inhabitants
                              for that day. On the succeeding night, however,
                              a new alarm took place, on a report that a number of
                              armed men had again landed from the Magdalen, about
                              four miles below the city, with a view it was presumed
                              of making another visit of nocturnal plunder. The
                              inhabitants again flew to arms; but, on the interposition
                              of the same eminent citizens, the ferment was allayed,
                              and nothing more was done than to strengthen the
                              usual patrol for the defence of the city. On the next
                              day, Saturday the 22d of April, when every thing was
                              perfectly quiet, lord Dunmore, with rather more heat
                              than discretion, sent a message into the city, by one of
                              the magistrates, and which his lordship had delivered
                              with the most solemn asseverations, that if any insult
                              were offered to capt. Foy (a British captain residing at
                              the palace as his secretary, and considered to be the
                              instigator of the governor to his violences) or to capt.
                              Collins, 
                              <hi id="d145581e2485" style="font-style: italic;">he would declare freedom to the slaves, and lay
                                 the town in ashes
                              </hi>; and he added, that he could easily
                              depopulate the whole county. At this time both capt.
                              Foy and Collins, were and had been continually walking
                              the streets, at their pleasure, without the slightest
                              indication of disrespect. The effect of a threat, so
                              diabolically ferocious, directed towards a people who
                              had ever shown him and his family such enthusiastic
                              marks of respect and attention, and following so directly

                              on the plunder of the magazine, will be readily
                              conceived. Yet it broke not out into any open act. His
                              lordship remained unmolested even by a disrespectful
                              look. The augmented patrol was kept up; but no
                              defensive preparation was made by the inhabitants of
                              the city.

                              circulated through the county with a rapidity
                              proportioned to their interest, and with this farther
                              aggravation, which was also true in point of fact, that in
                              addition to the clandestine removal of the powder, the
                              governor had caused the muskets in the magazine to be
                              stripped of their locks.

                           <p id="d145581e2495">In the midst of the irritation excited by this intelligence,
                              came the news of the bloody battles of Lexington
                              and Concord, resulting from an attempt of the governor,
                              general Gage, to seize the military stores deposited at
                              the latter place. The system of colonial subjugation
                              was now apparent: the effect was instantaneous. The
                              whole country flew to arms. The independent companies,
                              formed in happier times for the purpose of military
                              discipline, and under the immediate auspices of
                              lord Dunmore himself, raised the standard of liberty in
                              every county. By the 27th of April, there were assembled
                              at Fredericksburg, upwards of seven hundred men
                              well armed and disciplined, “friends of constitutional
                              liberty and America.” Their march, however, was
                              arrested by a letter from Mr. Peyton Randolph, in reply
                              to an express, and received on the 29th, by which they
                              were informed that the gentlemen of the city and
                              neighbourhood of Williamsburg, had had full assurance from
                              his excellency, that the affair of the powder should be
                              accommodated, and advising that the gentlemen of
                              Fredericksburg should proceed no farther. On the receipt
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2497"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="149" data-tei-n="136"> </a></span>
                              of this letter, a council was held of one hundred and two
                              members, delegates of the provincial convention, and
                              officers and special deputies of fourteen companies of light
                              horse, then rendezvoused on the ground; who, after the
                              most spirited expressions of their sentiments on the
                              conduct of the governor; and giving a mutual pledge to
                              be in readiness, at a moment's warning, to re-assemble,
                              and by force of arms, to defend the laws, the liberty,
                              and rights of this or any sister colony from unjust and
                              wicked invasion, advised the return of the several
                              companies to their respective homes; and also ordered that
                              expresses should be dispatched to the troops assembled
                              at the Bowling Green, and also to the companies from
                              Frederick, Berkeley, Dunmore, and such other counties
                              as were then on their march, to return them thanks for
                              their cheerful offers of service, and to acquaint them
                              with the determination then taken. By way of parody
                              on the governor's conclusion of the proclamations, by
                              which he was striving to keep down the spirit of the
                              country, “God save the king,” the council concluded
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e2499" style="font-style: italic;">their</hi> address with “God save the liberties of America.”

                           <p id="d145581e2503">Mr. Henry, however, was not disposed to let this
                              incident pass off so lightly. His was a mind that watched
                              events, with the coolness and sagacity of a veteran
                              statesman. He kindled, indeed, in the universal
                              indignation which the conduct of the governor was so well
                              calculated to excite; seeing clearly the inconvenience
                              which the colony must experience in the approaching
                              contest from the loss of even that small store of ammunition.
                              This, however; was a minor object in his
                              esteem. What he deemed of much higher importance
                              was, that 
                              <hi id="d145581e2505" style="font-style: italic;">that blow</hi>, which must be struck, sooner or
                              later, 
                              <hi id="d145581e2508" style="font-style: italic;">should be struck at once</hi>, before an overwhelming

                              force should enter the colony; that that habitual deference
                              and subjection which the people were accustomed
                              to feel towards the governor, as the representative
                              of royalty, and which bound their spirits in a kind
                              of torpid spell, should be dissolved and dissipated; that
                              the military resources of the country should be
                              developed; that the people might see and feel their
                              strength, by being brought out together; that the revolution
                              should be set in actual motion in the colony; that
                              the martial prowess of the country, should be awakened,
                              and the soldiery animated by that proud and resolute
                              confidence, which a successful enterprise in the
                              commencement of a contest never fails to inspire.
                              These sentiments were then avowed by him to two
                              confidential friends;<a href="note55" class="ref-external" n="55" rend="sc"> *</a> to whom he farther declared that
                              he considered the outrage on the magazine as a most
                              fortunate circumstance; and as one which would rouse
                              the people from north to south. “You may in vain
                              talk to them,” said he, “about the duties on tea, &amp;c. These things will not affect
                              them. They depend on
                              principles, too abstracted for their apprehension and
                              feeling. But tell them of the robbery of the magazine,
                              and that the next step will be to disarm them, you bring
                              the subject home to their bosoms, and they will be ready
                              to fly to arms to defend themselves.”

                              highest importance to American liberty. In order to
                              give greater dignity and authority to the decisions of that
                              meeting, he convoked to the same place, the county
                              committee. When assembled, he addressed them with
                              all the powers of his eloquence: laid open the plan on
                              which the British ministry had fallen to reduce the
                              colonies to subjection, by robbing them of all the means
                              of defending their rights: spread before their eyes in
                              colours of vivid description, the fields of Lexington
                              and Concord, still floating with the blood of their countrymen,
                              gloriously shed in the general cause; showed
                              them that the recent plunder of the magazine in
                              Williamsburg, was nothing more than a part of the general
                              system of subjugation; that the moment was now come in
                              which they were called upon to decide, whether they
                              chose to live free, and hand down the noble inheritance
                              to their children, or to become hewers of wood, and
                              drawers of water to those lordlings, who were themselves
                              the tools of a corrupt and tyrannical ministry—
                              he painted the country in a state of subjugation, and
                              drew such pictures of wretched debasement and abject
                              vassallage, as filled their souls with horror and indignation
                              —on the other hand, he carried them by the powers
                              of his eloquence, to an eminence like Mount Pisgah;
                              showed them the land of promise, which was to be won
                              by their valour, under the support and guidance of
                              heaven; and sketched a vision of America, enjoying
                              the smiles of liberty and peace, the rich productions of
                              her agriculture waving on every field, her commerce
                              whitening every sea, in tints so bright, so strong, so
                              glowing, as set the souls of his hearers on fire. He
                              had no doubt, he said, that that God, who in former
                              ages had hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he might show
                              forth his power and glory in the redemption of his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2527"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="152" data-tei-n="139"> </a></span>
                              chosen people, had, for similar purposes, permitted the
                              flagrant outrages which had occurred in Williamsburg,
                              and throughout the continent. It was for them now
                              to determine, whether they were worthy of this divine
                              interference; whether they would accept the high boon
                              now held out to them by heaven—that if they would,
                              though it might lead them through a sea of blood, they
                              were to remember that the same God whose power
                              divided the Red Sea for the deliverance of Israel, still
                              reigned in all his glory, unchanged and unchangeable—
                              was still the enemy of the oppressor, and the friend of
                              the oppressed—that he would cover them from their
                              enemies by a pillar of cloud by day, and guide their feet
                              through the night by a pillar of fire—that for his own
                              part, he was anxious that his native county should distinguish
                              itself in this grand career of liberty and glory,
                              and snatch the noble prize which was now offered to
                              their grasp—that no time was to be lost—that their
                              enemies in this colony were now few and weak; that it
                              would be easy for them, by a rapid and vigorous
                              movement, to compel the restoration of the powder which
                              had been carried off, or to make a reprisal on the king's
                              revenues in the hands of the receiver general, which
                              would fairly balance the account. That the Hanover
                              volunteers would thus have an opportunity of striking
                              the first blow in this colony, in the great cause of
                              American liberty, and would cover themselves with
                              never-fading laurels.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2530">These were heads of his harangue. I presume not
                              to give the colouring. That was Mr. Henry's own, and
                              beyond the power of any man's imitation. The effect,
                              however, was equal to his wishes. The meeting was in
                              a flame, and the decision immediately taken, that the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2532"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="153" data-tei-n="140"> </a></span>
                              powder should be retrieved, or counterbalanced by a reprisal.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2535">Capt. Samuel Meredith, who had theretofore commanded
                              the independent company, resigned his commission
                              in Mr. Henry's favour, and the latter gentleman
                              was immediately invested with the chief command of
                              the Hanover volunteers. Mr. Meredith accepted the
                              commission of lieutenant; and the present col. Parke
                              Goodall, was appointed the ensign of the company. Having
                              received orders from the committee, correspondent
                              with his own suggestions, capt. Henry forthwith took up
                              his line of march for Williamsburg. Ensign Goodall
                              was detached, with a party of sixteen men, to cross the
                              river into King William county, the residence of Richard
                              Corbin, the king's receiver general; to demand
                              from him three hundred and thirty pounds, the estimated
                              value of the powder; and, in the event of his
                              refusal, to make him a prisoner. He was ordered, in
                              this case, to treat his person with all possible respect
                              and tenderness, and to bring him to Doncastle's ordinary,
                              about sixteen miles above Williamsburg, where
                              the ensign was required, at all events, to rejoin the main
                              body. The detachment, in pursuance of their orders,
                              reached the residence of the receiver general some
                              hours after bedtime and a guard was stationed around
                              the house until morning. About day-break, however,
                              the ladies of the family made their appearance, and
                              gave to the commanding officer of the detachment the
                              firm and correct assurance, that col. Corbin was not at
                              home; but that the house, nevertheless, was open to
                              search, if it was the pleasure of the officer to make it.
                              The manner of the assurance, however, was too satisfactory
                              to render this necessary, and the detachment
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2537"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="154" data-tei-n="141"> </a></span>
                              hastened to form the junction with the main body which
                              had been ordered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2540">In the mean time, the march of this gallant corps,
                              in arms, headed by a man of Mr. Henry's distinction,
                              produced the most striking effects in every quarter.
                              Correspondent companies started up on all sides, and
                              hastened to throw themselves under the banners of
                              Henry. It is believed that five thousand men, at least,
                              were in arms, and were crossing the country to crowd
                              around his standard, and support it with their lives. The
                              march was conducted in the most perfect order, and
                              with the most scrupulous respect to the country through
                              which they passed. The ranks of the royalists were
                              filled with dismay. Lady Dunmore with her family
                              retired to the Fowey man of war, then lying off the
                              town of Little York. Even the patriots in Williamsburg
                              were daunted by the boldness, and, as they deemed
                              it, the rashness of the enterprise. Messenger after
                              messenger was despatched to meet Mr. Henry on the
                              way, and beg him to desist from his purpose, and
                              discharge his men. It was in vain. He was inflexibly
                              resolved to effect the purpose of his expedition, or to
                              perish in the attempt. The messengers were therefore
                              detained, that they might not report his strength; and
                              the march was continued with all possible celerity.
                              The governor issued a proclamation, in which he
                              denounced the movement, and called upon the people of
                              the country to resist it. He could as easily have called
                              spirits “from the vasty deep.” He seems not to have
                              relied much, himself, on the efficacy of his proclamation.
                              The palace was therefore filled with arms, and
                              a detachment of marines ordered up from the Fowey.
                              Before day-break, on the morning of the 4th of May,
                              capt. Montague, the commander of that ship, landed a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2542"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="155" data-tei-n="142"> </a></span>

                                       produce satisfaction to me, and I earnestly wish to the
                                       colony in general. The people here, have it in charge
                                       from Hanover committee, to tender their service to
                                       you, as a public officer, for the purpose of escorting
                                       the public treasury to any place in this colony, where
                                       the money would be judged more safe than in the city
                                       of Williamsburg. The reprisal now made by the
                                       Hanover volunteers, though accomplished in a manner
                                       least liable to the imputation of violent extremity, may
                                       possibly be the cause of future injury to the treasury.
                                       If, therefore, you apprehend the least danger, a sufficient
                                       guard is at your service. I beg the return of the

                              it proper to proceed no farther. Their expedition having

                              in triumph to their respective homes. The committee

                              Mr. Henry, who had been on the point of setting out
                              for congress at the time when he had been called on by
                              the intelligence from Williamsburg, now resumed his
                              journey, and was escorted in triumph, by a large party
                              of gentlemen, as far as Hooe's ferry on the Potomack.
                              Messengers were sent after him from all directions;
                              bearing the thanks and the applauses of his assembled
                              countrymen, for his recent enterprise: and in such
                              throngs did these addresses come, that the necessity of
                              halting to read and answer them, converted a journey
                              of one day, into a triumph of many. Thus, the same
                              man, whose genius had in the year 1765 given the first
                              political impulse to the revolution, had now the additional
                              honour of heading the first military movement in
                              Virginia, in support of the same cause.

                           <p id="d145581e2790">I CANNOT learn that Mr. Henry distinguished himself
                              peculiarly, at this session of congress. The spirit of
                              resistance was sufficiently excited; and nothing remained
                              but to organize that resistance, and to plan and
                              execute the details which were to give it effect. In
                              business of this nature, Mr. Henry, as we have seen,
                              was not efficient. It has been already stated, that he
                              was unsuccessful in composition, of which much was
                              done, and eminently done, at this session; and the lax
                              habits of his early life, had implanted in him an insuperable
                              aversion to the drudgery of details. He could
                              not endure confinement of any sort, nor the labour of
                              close and solitary thinking. His habits were all social,
                              and his mind delighted in unlimited range. His conclusions
                              were never reached by an elaborate deduction of
                              thought; he gained them as it were

                              a certainty not less infallible than that of the driest and
                              severest logician. It is not wonderful therefore, that he
                              felt himself lost amid the operations in which congress
                              was now engaged; and that he enjoyed the relief which
                              was afforded him, by a military appointment from his
                              native state. It will be proper, however, to explain particularly
                              the proceedings which led to this incident in the
                              life of Mr. Henry.

                           <p id="d145581e2799">Shortly after the affair of the gunpowder, lord North's
                              conciliatory proposition, popularly called the Olive
                              Branch, arrived in America. Hereupon, the governor
                              of Virginia called a meeting of the house of burgesses;
                              and as if the quarrel were now completely over, lady

                              Dunmore and her family returned from the Fowey to

                              according to the proclamation of lord Dunmore, met at
                              the capitol in the city of Williamsburg. He addressed
                              them with great earnestness on the alarming state of the
                              colony; and exhibited the conciliatory proposition of
                              the British ministry, as an advance on the part of the
                              mother country, which it was the duty of the colonists
                              to meet with gratitude and devotion. The council
                              answered him in a manner perfectly satisfactory; but
                              before he could receive the answer of the house of
                              burgesses, an incident occurred, which drove his lordship
                              precipitately from his palace, and terminated for ever
                              all friendly relations between himself and the people of
                              Virginia.

                                    the people seem to have poured their feelings without reserve, that lady
                                    was eminently a favourite in this colony. Her residence here had been
                                    short; yet the exalted virtues which marked her character, and those domestic
                                    graces and attractions, which shone with the more lustre by contrast
                                    with his lordship, had already endeared her to the people; and would have
                                    consecrated her person, and those of her children, amid the wildest tumult
                                    to which this colony could possibly be excited. The people had been
                                    extremely wounded by her late departure for the Fowey: they considered it
                                    as a measure of his lordship's, and as an unjust reflection both upon the
                                    judgment and generosity of the people of this country. They had told him
                                    intelligibly enough, that they had formed a much more correct estimate of
                                    her worth than he himself appeared to have done; and that so far from her
                                    being insecure in the bosom of a people who thus admired, respected, and
                                    loved her, his lordship would have acted much more wisely to have kept her
                                    near his person, and covered himself under the sacred shield which sanctified
                                    her in the eyes of Virginians. In proportion to their regret and mortification
                                    at her departure, was the ardour of delight with which they hailed
                                    her return. A paragraph in Purdie's paper assured her, “that her arrival
                                    at the palace was to the great joy of the citizens of Williamsburg and of
                                    the people of the whole country, who had the most unfeigned regard and
                                    affection for her ladyship, and wished her long to live amongst them.”

                              removal of the powder, and while Mr. Henry was on
                              his march towards Willliamsburg, some of the inhahitants
                              of the town, to the great offence of the graver
                              citizens, had possessed themselves of a few of the guns
                              which still remained in the magazine. This step gave
                              great displeasure as well as alarm to the governor; and
                              although the mayor and council, as well as all the more
                              respectable inhabitants of the town, condemned it in
                              terms as strong as his own, and sincerely united in the
                              means which were used to recover the arms, yet his
                              lordship continued to brood over it in secret, until, with
                              the aid of the minions of the palace, he hatched a
                              scheme of low and cruel revenge, sufficient of itself to
                              cover him with immortal infamy. It was on Monday
                              night, the 5th of June, that this scheme discovered itself.
                              “Last Monday night,” says Purdie, “an unfortunate
                              accident happened to two persons of this city, who, with
                              a number of others, had assembled at the magazine, to
                              furnish themselves with arms. Upon their entering the
                              door, one of the guns, which had a spring to it, and
                              was charged eight fingers deep with swan shot, went
                              off and lodged two balls in one of their shoulders,
                              another entered at his wrist, and is not yet extracted; the
                              other person had one of his fingers shot off, and the next
                              to it so much shattered as to render it useless, by which
                              sad misfortune, he is deprived of the means of procuring
                              a livelihood by his business. Spring guns, it seems,
                              were placed at other parts of the magazine,

                              person lost his life, the perpetrator or perpetrators of
                              this diabolical invention, might have been justly branded

                              deliberate and barbarous treachery, which was at once
                              traced to lord Dunmore, was farther aggravated by a
                              discovery that several barrels of powder had been buried
                              in the magazine, with the purpose, it was reasonably
                              conjectured, of being used as a mine, and thus producing
                              still more fatal destruction, when the occasion
                              should offer. Early on the next morning, lord Dunmore
                              with his family, including captain Foy, fled from
                              the palace to return to it no more, and took shelter on
                              board the Fowey, from the vengeance which he knew
                              he so justly deserved. No commotion, however, had
                              ensued to justify his retreat. The people, indeed, were
                              highly indignant, but they were silent and quiet. The
                              suggestions of his lordship's conscience, had alone
                              produced his flight. He left behind him a message to the
                              speaker and house of burgesses, in which he ascribed
                              his movement to apprehensions for his personal safety;
                              stated that he should fix his residence on board the
                              Fowey; that no interruption should be given to the
                              sitting of the assembly; that he should make the access
                              to him easy and safe; and thought it would be more
                              agreeable to the house to send to him from time to time,
                              one or more of their members as occasion might require,
                              than to put the whole body to the trouble of moving
                              to be near him.

                           <p id="d145581e2833">On receiving this message, the house immediately
                              resolved itself into a committee of the whole, and
                              prepared an answer; in which they expressed their deep
                              concern at the step which he had taken—assuring him
                              that his apprehensions of personal danger were entirely
                              unfounded; regretting that he had not expressed them
                              to the house previous to his departure, since from their
                              zeal and attachment to the preservation of order and
                              good government, they should have judged it their
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2835"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="165" data-tei-n="152"> </a></span>
                              indispensable duty to have endeavoured to remove any
                              cause of disquietude. They express the anxiety with
                              which they contemplate the very disagreeable situation
                              of his most amiable lady and her family, and assure him,
                              that they should think themselves happy in being able
                              to restore their perfect tranquillity, by removing all their
                              fears. They regret his departure and the manner of
                              it, as tending to keep up the great uneasiness, which
                              had of late so unhappily prevailed in this country; and
                              declare that they will cheerfully concur in any measure
                              that may be proposed, proper for the security of himself
                              and his family; they remind him how impracticable it
                              will be to carry on the business of the session with any
                              tolerable degree of propriety, or with that despatch
                              which the advanced season of the year required, whilst
                              his lordship was so far removed from them, and so
                              inconveniently situated; and conclude, with entreating
                              him that he would be pleased to return with his lady
                              and family to the palace, which, they say, they are
                              persuaded will give the greatest satisfaction, and be the
                              most likely means of quieting the minds of the people.

                           <p id="d145581e2838">This communication was carried down to him by a
                              deputation of two members of the council, and four of
                              the house of burgesses; and in reply to language so
                              respectful, and assurances so friendly and conciliatory,
                              his lordship returned an answer in which he charged
                              them with having slighted his offers of respect and
                              civility, with giving countenance to the violent and disorderly
                              proceedings of the people, and with an usurpation
                              of the executive power in ordering and appointing
                              guards to mount in the city of Williamsburg, with the
                              view, 
                              <hi id="d145581e2840" style="font-style: italic;">as was pretended</hi> to protect the magazine, but
                              which might well be doubted, as there then remained
                              nothing therein which required being guarded: he
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2843"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="166" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span>
                              exhorts them to return within the pale of their
                              constitutional power; to redress the many grievances which
                              existed; to open the courts of justice; to disarm the
                              independent companies; and what was not less essential,
                              by their own example, and every means in their
                              power, to abolish the spirit of persecution which pursued
                              with menaces and acts of oppression, all his majesty's
                              loyal and orderly subjects. For the accomplishment of
                              which ends, he invited them to adjourn to the town of
                              York, opposite to which the Fowey lay, where he promised
                              to meet and remain with them till their business should
                              be finished. But with respect to their entreaty that he
                              would return to the palace, he represents to them that
                              unless they closed in with the conciliatory proposition
                              now offered to them by the British parliament, his
                              return to Williamsburg would be as fruitless to the
                              people, as possibly it might be dangerous to himself.
                              So that he places the event of his returning, on their
                              acceptance of lord North's offer of conciliation.

                           <p id="d145581e2846">The house of burgesses now took up that proposition;
                              and having examined it in every light, with
                              the utmost attention, they conclude with a firm and
                              dignified rejection of it, and an appeal “to the
                              even-handed justice of that Being who doth no wrong;
                              earnestly beseeching him to illuminate the councils, and
                              prosper the endeavours, of those to whom America had
                              confided her hopes, that through their wise direction,
                              we may again see re-united, the blessings of liberty and
                              prosperity, and the most permanent harmony with Great

                           <p id="d145581e2861">A correspondence on another topic was now opened
                              between the council and burgesses, and the governor
                              Dunmore. The former addressed him with a request,
                              that he should order a large parcel of arms which
                              he had left in the palace to be removed to the public
                              magazine, a place of greater safety. This he peremptorily
                              refused; and ordered that those arms, 
                              <hi id="d145581e2863" style="font-style: italic;">belonging to the
                                 king
                              </hi>, should not be touched without his express permission.
                              In their reply, they say, that the arms may in some
                              sort be considered as belonging to the king, as the supreme
                              head of the government, and that they were properly under
                              his lordship's direction; yet, they humbly conceived, that
                              they were originally provided, and had been preserved,
                              for the use of the country in cases of emergency. The
                              palace, they say, had indeed been hitherto much respected,
                              but not so much out of regard to the building, as
                              the residence of his majesty's representative. Had his
                              lordship thought fit to remain there, they would have had
                              no apprehensions of danger; but considering these
                              arms at present, as exposed to his lordship's servants
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e2866" style="font-style: italic;">and every rude invader</hi>, the security derived from his
                              lordship's presence could not now be relied on. They
                              therefore, again entreat him to order the removal of the
                              arms to the magazine. They then proceed to state,
                              that they cannot decline representing to him, that the
                              important business of the assembly had been much
                              impeded by his excellency's removal from the palace—
                              that this step had deprived them of that free and necessary
                              access to his lordship, to which they were entitled
                              by the constitution of the country—that there were
                              several bills of the last importance to the country now
                              ready to be presented to his excellency for his assent.
                              They complain of the inconvenience to which they had
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2869"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="168" data-tei-n="155"> </a></span>
                              been put in sending their members twelve miles to wait
                              on his excellency, on board of one of his majesty's ships
                              of war, to present their addresses—they state that they
                              think it would be highly improper, and too great a
                              departure from the constitutional and accustomed mode
                              of transacting business, to meet his excellency at any
                              other place than the capitol, to present such bills as were
                              ready for his signature—and therefore, beseech him to
                              return for this purpose.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2872">To all this he gave a very short answer; that as to
                              the arms, he had already declared his intention, and
                              conceived they were meddling with a subject which did
                              not belong to them; he desired to know whom they
                              designed by the term 
                              <hi id="d145581e2874" style="font-style: italic;">rude invader</hi>; that the disorders
                              in Williamsburg and other parts of the country, had
                              driven him from the palace; and that if any inconvenience
                              had arisen to the assembly on that account, he
                              was not chargeable with it, that they had not been
                              deprived of any necessary or free access to him; that
                              the constitution undoubtedly vested him with the power
                              of calling the assembly to any place in the colony, which
                              exigency might require; that not having been made
                              acquainted with the whole proceedings of the assembly,
                              he knew of no bills of importance, which if he were
                              inclined to risk his person again among the people, the
                              assembly had to present to him, nor whether they were
                              such as he could assent to.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2878">In the course of their correspondence he required
                              the house to attend him on board the Foley, for the
                              purpose of obtaining his signature to the bills; and some
                              of the members, to prevent an actual dissolution of the
                              government, and to give effect to the many necessary
                              bills which they had passed, proposed to yield to
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2880"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="169" data-tei-n="156"> </a></span>
                              this extraordinary requisition. The project, however,
                              was exploded by a member's rising in his place, and
                              relating the fable of the sick lion and the fox.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2883">The governor having thus virtually abdicated his
                              office, the government was, in effect, dissolved. The
                              house hereupon resolved, “That his lordship's message,
                              requiring the house to attend him on board one of his
                              majesty's ships of war, is a high breach of the rights
                              and privileges of this house.” “That the unreasonable
                              delays thrown into the proceedings of this house by the
                              governor, and his evasive answers to the sincere and
                              decent addresses of the representatives of the people,
                              give us great reason to fear that a dangerous attack
                              may be meditated against the unhappy people of this
                              colony.” “It is, therefore, our opinion, they say, that
                              they prepare for the preservation of their property, and
                              their inestimable rights and liberties with the greatest
                              care and attention:” “That we do and will bear faith
                              and true allegiance to our most gracious sovereign
                              George the III. our only lawful and rightful king; that
                              we will, at all times, to the utmost of our power, and at
                              the risk of our lives and properties, maintain and defend
                              his government in this colony, as founded on the established
                              laws and principles of the constitution: That
                              it is our most earnest desire to preserve and strengthen
                              those bonds of amity, with all our fellow-subjects in
                              Great Britain, which are so very essential to the prosperity
                              and happiness of both countries.” Having
                              adopted these resolutions without a dissenting voice,
                              they adjourned themselves to the 12th of October
                              following; and the delegates were summoned to
                              meet in convention at the town of Richmond, on the

                           <p id="d145581e2916">Immediately on the adjournment of the house of
                              burgesses, a very full meeting of the citizens of
                              Williamsburg, convened on the call of Peyton Randolph,
                              at the court house in that city, “to consider of the
                              expediency of stationing a number of men there, for
                              the public safety; as well to assist the citizens in their
                              nightly watches, as to guard against any surprise from
                              our enemies;” whereupon, it was unanimously agreed
                              (until the general convention should meet) to invite
                              down from a number of counties, to the amount of two
                              hundred and fifty men. Meanwhile, until they arrived,
                              the neighbouring counties, they say, were kind enough
                              to lend them their assistance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2919">On the 29th of June, the Fowey ship, and Magdalen
                              schooner sailed from York; on board the latter went
                              lady Dunmore, and the rest of the governor's family,
                              bound for England; and the colony was for a short time
                              relieved by the report, that the Fowey carried lord Dunmore
                              and captain Foy, on a visit to general Gage, at
                              Boston. This report, however, was unfounded. The
                              Fowey merely escorted the Magdalen to the capes, and
                              then returned again to her moorings before York.
                              The Otter sloop of war, commanded by capt. Squire,
                              thereupon fell down to the mouth of York river, with
                              the intention of cruising along the coast, and seizing all
                              provision vessels; and soon became distinguished, at
                              least, for the malignity of her attempts. The Fowey was
                              relieved by the ship Mercury of 24 guns, John Macartney,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2921"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="171" data-tei-n="158"> </a></span>
                              commander; and departed for Boston, carrying
                              with her the now obnoxious capt. Foy. The governor's
                              domestics left the palace, and removed to his farm at
                              Montibello, about six miles below Williamsburg; and
                              the governor, himself, fixed his station at the town of
                              Portsmouth. In this posture of things, on Monday, the
                              24th of July, 1775, the colonial convention met at the
                              city of Richmond.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2924">The proceedings of this convention were marked by
                              a character of great decision and vigour. One of their
                              first measures was an ordinance for raising and embodying
                              a sufficient force for the defence and protection of
                              this colony. By this ordinance, it was provided, that two
                              regiments of regulars, to consist of one thousand and
                              twenty privates rank and file, should be forthwith raised
                              and taken into the pay of the colony; and a competent
                              regular force was also provided for the protection of
                              the western frontier. The whole colony was divided
                              into sixteen military districts; with a provision, that a
                              regiment of six hundred and eighty men, rank and file,
                              should be raised on the eastern shore district, and a
                              battalion of five hundred in each of the others; to be
                              forthwith armed, trained, furnished with all military
                              accoutrements, and ready to march at a minute's warning.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2927">A committee, called the committee of safety, was also
                              organized, with functions and powers analogous to
                              those of the executive department; and apparently
                              designed to supply the vacancy occasioned by the
                              governor's abdication of that branch of the government.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2930">The convention now proceeded to the appointment
                              of officers to command the regular forces. The lofty
                              stand which Mr. Henry had taken in the American
                              cause, his increasing popularity, and the prompt and
                              energetic movement which he had made in the affair of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2932"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="172" data-tei-n="159"> </a></span>
                              the gunpowder, brought him strongly before the view
                              of the house; and he was elected the colonel of the
                              first regiment, 
                              <hi id="d145581e2934" style="font-style: italic;">and the commander of all the forces
                                 raised, and to be raised, for the defence of the colony
                              </hi>.
                              Mr. William Woodford, who is said to have distinguished
                              himself in the French and Indian war, was
                              appointed to the command of the second regiment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2939">The place of rendezvous for the troops was the city
                              of Williamsburg. Mr. Henry was at his post on the
                              20th of September, examining the grounds adjacent to
                              the city, for the purpose of selecting an encampment;
                              and the place chosen was at the back of William and
                              Mary college. The troops were recruited and poured
                              in with wonderful rapidity. The papers of the day
                              teem with the annunciation of company after company,
                              both regulars and minute men, with the highest encomiums
                              on the appearance and spirit of the troops; and
                              had the purpose been offensive war, col. Henry was
                              soon in a situation to have annihilated any force that
                              lord Dunmore could at that time, have arrayed against
                              him. But there was, in truth, something extremely
                              singular and embarrassing in the situation of the parties
                              in regard to each other. It was not war, nor was it peace.
                              The very ordinance by which these troops were raised,
                              was filled with professions of allegiance and fidelity to
                              George the III.—professions whose sincerity there is the
                              less reason to doubt, because they are confined to the
                              exercise of his constitutional powers, and stand connected
                              with an expression of their firm determination
                              to resist any attempt on the liberties of the country.
                              The only intelligible purpose, therefore, for which these
                              troops were raised, was a preparation for defence; and
                              for defence against an attempt to enforce the parliamentary
                              taxes upon this colony. With respect to lord
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e2941"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="173" data-tei-n="160"> </a></span>
                              Dunmore, he was indeed, considered as having abandoned
                              the duties of his office; yet still he was regarded
                              as the governor of Virginia; and there seems to have
                              been no disposition to offer violence to his person.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2944">Dunmore, on his part, considered the colony as in a
                              state of open and general rebellion; not merely designing
                              to resist an attempt to enforce upon them an obnoxious
                              tax; but to subvert the regal government wholly
                              and entirely; and had his power been equal to his
                              wishes, there is no reason to doubt that he would have
                              disarmed the colony; and hung up, without ceremony,
                              the leaders of this traitorous revolt, as he affected to
                              consider it. His impotence however, and the aversion
                              of the colonists to act otherwise than defensively,
                              produced a suspense full of the most painful anxiety.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e2947">In the mean time, capt. Squire, commander of his
                              majesty's sloop the Otter, had been labouring throughout
                              the summer with some success, to change the defensive
                              attitude of the colony. He was engaged in cruising
                              continually in James and York rivers, plundering the
                              defenceless shores, and carrying off the slaves, wherever
                              seduction or force could place them in his power.
                              These piratical excursions had wrought up the citizens
                              who were not in arms, to a very high pitch of resentment;
                              and an accident soon gave them an opportunity
                              of partial reprisal, which they did not fail to seize. On
                              the 2d of September, the captain, sailing in a tender,
                              on a marauding expedition from James to York river,

                              was driven on shore, upon Back river, near Hampton.
                              It was night, and the storm still raging:—the captain
                              and his men, distrusting (unjustly, as it would seem from
                              the papers) the hospitality of the inhabitants, made their
                              escape through the woods; the vessel was on the next

                              invasion. Squire, however, satisfied himself for the
                              present, by falling down to Hampton road, where he
                              seized the passage boats, with the negroes in them, by
                              way of reprisal as he alleged, for the stores, &amp;c. taken
                              out of his tender when driven ashore in the late storm;

                              property of his majesty's peaceable subjects in this colony—
                              on Wednesday night last, a party from an armed tender
                              landed near Hampton, and took away a valuable
                              negro slave and a sail from the owner. Next morning
                              there appeared off the mouth of Hampton river, a large
                              armed schooner, a sloop, and three tenders, with soldiers
                              on board, and a message was received at Hampton from
                              captain Squire, on board the schooner, that he would
                              that day land and burn the town; on which a company
                              of regulars, and a company of minute men,<a href="note60" class="ref-external" n="60" rend="sc"> *</a> who had
                              been placed there in consequence of former threats
                              denounced against that place, made the best disposition
                              to prevent their landing, aided by a body of militia who
                              were suddenly called together on the occasion. The
                              enemy accordingly attempted to land, but were retarded
                              by some boats sunk across the channel for that purpose.
                              Upon this they fired several small cannon at the
                              provincials without any effect, who in return discharged
                              their small arms so effectually, as to make the enemy
                              move off, with the loss of several men, as it is believed.
                              But they had in the mean time, burnt down a house
                              belonging to Mr. Cooper, on the river. On intelligence
                              of this reaching Williamsburg, about nine o'clock at
                              night, a company of riflemen was dispatched to the aid
                              of Hampton,

                              arrived about eight o'clock next morning. The enemy
                              had in the night cut through the boats sunk, and made
                              a passage for their vessels, which were drawn close up

                              arrival of the party from Williamsburg; but as soon as
                              our men were so disposed as to give them a few shot,
                              they went off so hastily that our people took a small
                              tender, with five white men, a woman, and two slaves,
                              six swivels, seven muskets, some small arms, a sword,
                              pistols, and other things, and several papers belonging
                              to lieutenant Wright, who made his escape by jumping
                              overboard and swimming away with Mr. King's man,

                              them. There were two of the men in the vessel
                              mortally wounded; one is since dead, and the other near
                              his end. Besides which, we are informed, nine were
                              seen to be thrown overboard from one of the vessels.
                              We have not a man even wounded. The vessels went
                              over to Norfolk, and we are informed the whole force
                              from thence is intended to visit Hampton this day. If
                              they should, we hope our brave troops are prepared for

                              it in vain. But the committee of safety<a href="note61" class="ref-external" n="61" rend="sc"> *</a> seem to
                              have distrusted too much his want of military experience,
                              to confide to him so important an enterprise.
                              The disgust which Mr. Henry had conceived at this
                              palpable reflection on his military capacity, was
                              increased by colonel Woodford's refusal to acknowledge
                              his superiority in command. This gentleman, after his

                              when not so, to the committee of safety. On the 6th

                                       out of town, I have not written you before last Monday,
                                       by the return of the honourable the convention's
                                       express, when I referred you to my letter to them, for
                                       every particular respecting mine and the enemy's situation.
                                       I wrote them again yesterday and this morning,
                                       which no doubt they will communicate to you, as
                                       commanding officer of the troops at Williamsburg. When
                                       joined, I shall always esteem myself immediately under
                                       your command, and will obey accordingly; but when
                                       sent to command a separate and distinct body of
                                       troops, under the immediate instructions of the
                                       committee of safety—whenever that body or the honourable
                                       convention is sitting, I look upon it as my indispensable
                                       duty to address my intelligence to them,
                                       as the supreme power in this colony. If I judge
                                       wrong, I hope that honourable body will set me right.
                                       I would wish to keep up the greatest harmony between
                                       us, for the good of the cause we are engaged in; but
                                       cannot bear to be supposed to have neglected my duty,
                                       when I have done every thing I conceived to be so.
                                       The enemy are strongly fortified on the other side the
                                       bridge, and a great number of negroes and tories with
                                       them; my prisoners disagree as to the numbers. We
                                       are situate here in mud and mire, exposed to every
                                       hardship that can be conceived, but the want of provisions,
                                       of which our stock is but small, the men suffering
                                       for shoes; and if ever soldiers deserved a second blanket
                                       in any service, they do in this; our stock of ammunition
                                       much reduced, no bullet moulds that were good for
                                       any thing sent to run up our lead, till those sent the

                                       other day by Mr. Page. If these necessaries and better
                                       arms had been furnished in time for this detachment,
                                       they might have prevented much trouble and great
                                       expense to this colony. Most of those arms I received
                                       the other day from Williamsburg, are rather to be considered
                                       as lumber, than fit to be put in men's hands, in
                                       the face of an enemy: with much repair, some of them
                                       will do; with those, and what I have taken from the
                                       enemy, hope to be better armed in a few days. I have
                                       written the convention, that it was my opinion, the
                                       greatest part of the 1st regiment ought immediately to
                                       march to the scene of action with some cannon, and a
                                       supply of ammunition, and every other necessary for
                                       war that the colony can muster, that a stop may be put
                                       to the enemy's progress. As to the Carolina troops and
                                       cannon, they are by no means what I was made to
                                       expect: 60 of them are here, and 100 will be here tomorrow;
                                       more, it is said, will follow in a few days,
                                       under col. Howe; badly armed, cannon not mounted,
                                       no furniture to them. How long these people will
                                       choose to stay, is impossible for me to say; 99 in 100
                                       of these lower people, rank tories. From all these
                                       informations, if you can make a diversion in my favour,
                                       it will be of service to the colony, and very acceptable
                                       to myself and soldiers; whom if possible, I will endeavour
                                       to keep easy under their hard duty, but begin to
                                       doubt whether it will be the case long.”

                              news of the victory of the Great Bridge, by which col.
                              Woodford at once threw into the shade the military
                              pretensions of all the other state officers; a circumstance
                              not very well calculated to gild the pill of contumacy,
                              which he had just presented to the commander
                              in chief. The committee of safety had now a delicate
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3223"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="184" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span>
                              part to act between these two officers; they were
                              extremely anxious to avoid the decision of the question
                              which had arisen between then, seeing very distinctly
                              that their decision could not but disappoint very painfully,
                              that gentleman who was their favourite officer.
                              They seem to have been apprehensive that col. Woodford
                              would be led, by that decision, to resign in disgust;
                              and were justly alarmed at the idea of losing the services
                              of so valuable an officer, especially after the
                              distinction which he had recently gained at the Great
                              Bridge. Mr. Henry, however, insisted that the committee
                              or convention should determine the question, as
                              being the only way to settle the construction of his
                              commission. It was accordingly taken up, and decided by
                              the following order of the committee.

                              proof of the very high estimate in which he was held by
                              the committee; and the same evidence furnishes very
                              decisive proof that colonel Henry had not owed his military

                              dexterity, to that object; the writer, after some introductory

                              I think, clearly gives the convention, and committee of
                              safety acting under their authority, the absolute direction
                              of the troops. The dispute between you must be
                              occasioned I suppose, (for I have not seen your letter to
                              the colonel) by disregard of him as commander, after
                              the adjournment of the committee of safety, and before
                              the meeting of the convention; at which time, I am apt
                              to think, though I am not military man enough to
                              determine, your correspondence should have been with
                              him as commanding officer. I have talked with colonel
                              Henry about this matter; he thinks he has been ill
                              treated, and insists the officers under his command
                              shall submit to his orders. I recommended it to him
                              to treat the business with caution and temper; as a
                              difference at this critical moment, between our troops,
                              would be attended with the most fatal consequences;
                              and took the liberty to assure him you would, I was
                              certain, submit to whatever was thought just and
                              reasonable. He has laid the letter before the committee of
                              safety, whose sentiments upon the subject, I expect you
                              must have received before this. I hope it will not come
                              before us,<a href="note63" class="ref-external" n="63" rend="sc"> *</a> but from what colonel Henry said, he intimated
                              it must, as it could be no otherwise determined.
                              My sentiments upon that delicate point, I partly
                              communicated upon the expected junction of the Carolina

                              troops with ours, which I presume you have received.
                              By your letter yesterday to the president, I find you
                              agree with me. I very cordially congratulate you on
                              the success at the Bridge and the reduction of the fort,
                              which will give our troops the benefit of better and
                              more wholesome ground. Your letter came to the
                              convention just time enough to read it before we broke
                              up, as it was nearly dark; it was however proposed,
                              and agreed that the President should transmit you the
                              approbation of your conduct in treating with kindness
                              and humanity the unfortunate prisoners; and that your
                              readiness to avoid dispute about rank with colonel
                              Howe, they consider as a further mark of your attachment
                              to the service of your country. I have had it in
                              contemplation paying you a visit, but have not been able
                              to leave the convention, as many of our members are
                              absent, and seem to be in continual rotation, some going,
                              others returning. We shall raise many more battalions,
                              and as soon as practicable, arm some vessels. A
                              comr. or general, I suppose, will be sent us by the
                              congress, as it is expected our troops will be upon
                              continental pay. I pray God to protect you, and prosper all
                              your endeavours.”

                           <p id="d145581e3306">But the letter from the chairman of the committee,
                              which enclosed the resolution, is a master-piece of
                              address, so far as relates to the feelings of col. Woodford;
                              though certainly not well judged to promote the
                              permanent harmony of those officers, by inspiring
                              sentiments of respect and subordination for the superior.
                              The letter bears date on the 24th December, 1775: it
                              is written in a strain of the most frank and conciliatory
                              friendship—full of deserved eulogy on col. Woodford's
                              conduct and very far from complimentary to the
                              colonel of the first regiment. In relation to this
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3308"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="188" data-tei-n="175"> </a></span>
                              gentleman, (after having mentioned the resolution of raising
                              other regiments,) he says, “The field officers to each
                              regiment will be named here, and recommended to
                              congress; in case our army is taken into continental pay,
                              they will send commissions. A general officer will be
                              chosen there, I doubt not, and sent us; 
                              <hi id="d145581e3310" style="font-style: italic;">with that matter,
                                 I hope, we shall not intermeddle, lest it should
                                 be thought propriety requires our calling or rather
                                 recommending our present first officer to that station
                              </hi>.
                              Believe me sir, the unlucky step of calling that gentleman
                              from our councils, where he was useful, into the
                              field, in an important station, the duties of which he
                              must in the nature of things, be an entire stranger to,
                              has given me many an anxious and uneasy moment. In
                              consequence of this mistaken step, which can't now be
                              retracted or remedied, for he has done nothing worthy
                              of degradation, and must keep his rank, we must be
                              deprived of the service of some able officers, whose
                              honour and former ranks will not suffer them to act
                              under him in this juncture, when we so much need
                              their services; however, I am told, that Mercer, Bucknel,
                              Dangerfield, and Weedon, will serve, and are all
                              thought of. I am also told, that Mr. Thurston and Mr.
                              Millikin are candidates for regiments: the latter, I
                              believe, will raise and have a German one. In the
                              course of these reflections, my great concern is on your
                              account. The pleasure I have enjoyed in finding your
                              army conducted with wisdom and success, and your
                              conduct meet with the general approbation of the
                              convention and country, makes me more uneasy at a
                              thought that the country should be deprived of your
                              services, or you made uneasy in it, by any untoward
                              circumstances. I had seen your letter to our friend Mr.
                              Jones, (now a member of the committee of safety,) and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3313"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="189" data-tei-n="176"> </a></span>
                              besides that, col. Henry has laid before the committee
                              your letter to him, and desired our opinion, whether he
                              was to command you or not. We never determined
                              this till Friday evening; a copy of the resolution I
                              enclose you. If this will not be agreeable, and prevent
                              future disputes, I hope some happy medium will be
                              suggested to effect the purpose, and make you easy; for the
                              colony cannot part with you, while troops are necessary
                              to be continued.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e3316">Mr. Henry had too much sagacity not to perceive the
                              light in which he was viewed by the committee of
                              safety, and too much sensibility not to be wounded by
                              the discovery. His situation was indeed, at this time,
                              most painfully embarassing. The rank which he held
                              was full of the promise of honour and distinction; he
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e3318" style="font-style: italic;">was the first officer of the Virginia forces</hi>; the celebrity
                              which he had already attained among his countrymen,
                              not only by his political resistance to the measures
                              of the British parliament, but by the bold and daring
                              military enterprise which he had headed the preceding
                              year, in the affair of the gunpowder, led his countrymen
                              to expect, that the appointment which he now
                              held would not a barren one, but that he would
                              mark it with the characters of his extraordinary genius,
                              and become as distinguished in the field, as he had been
                              in the senate. He knew that these expectations were
                              entertained, and had every disposition to realize them;
                              but his wishes and his hopes were perpetually over-ruled
                              by the comittee of safety, who commanded over him,
                              and who gratuitously distrusting his capacity for war,
                              would give him no opportunity of making trial of it.
                              Yet Mr. Henry untried, has been most unjustly slighted
                              as a soldier; and spoken of as a mere military cipher!
                              If I have not been misinformed, some of those who
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3321"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="190" data-tei-n="177"> </a></span>
                              composed this very committee, did in after times,
                              frequently allude to this period of his life, to prove the
                              practical inutility of his character, and have applied to
                              him the sayings, which Wilkes applied to lord Chatham,
                              that “all his power and efficacy was seated in his
                              tongue.”<a href="note64" class="ref-external" n="64" rend="sc"> *</a> What figure he might have made in war,
                              had the opportunity been allowed him, can now be only
                              matter of speculation. His personal bravery, so far as
                              I have heard, has never been called in question; or if
                              it has, it has been without evidence; and neither his
                              ardour in the public cause, or his strong natural sense,
                              can with any colour of justice be disputed. If we
                              superadd to these qualities, that presence of mind, that
                              promptitude, boldness, and novelty of view—that
                              dexterous address, and fertility of expedient, for which he
                              was remarkable—I can see no reason to doubt, that he
                              would have justified the highest expectations of his
                              admirers, had he been permitted to command the
                              expedition which he courted. As to his want of experience,
                              the alleged ground for keeping him so ignominiously
                              confined to head quarters, he possessed pretty nearly as
                              much experience as colonel Washington had, when he
                              covered the retreat of Braddock's routed forces; as
                              much too, as those young generals of ours, who have
                              recently covered themselves with so much glory on our
                              northern frontier: nor would it seem to comport with
                              that respect which the committee owed to the convention,
                              from whom both colonel Henry and themselves had
                              received their respective appointments, to arrogate the
                              power of reversing the decree of the convention, and
                              practically degrading the officer of their first choice.

                              It is certain that the committee were severely spoken
                              of at the day, and that the people, as well as the soldiery,
                              did not hesitate openly to impute their conduct towards
                              Mr. Henry, to personal envy.

                           <p id="d145581e3344">Other humiliations yet awaited him. Shortly after the
                              affair of the Great Bridge, colonel Howe of North
                              Carolina, at the head of five or six hundred men of
                              that state, joined colonel Woodford; and taking the
                              command of the whole, with the consent of the latter
                              gentleman, who yielded to the seniority of his commission,
                              marched with their united forces into Norfolk, which
                              had been evacuated by the British. From this post,
                              colonel Howe continually addressed his communications
                              to the committee of safety, or to the convention;
                              and colonel Henry, after having seen his lawful rights
                              and honours transferred in the first instance, to an
                              inferior officer of his own, had now the mortification
                              of seeing himself completely superseded, and almost
                              annihilated, by an officer from another state of only
                              equal rank.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e3347">But even this was not all: six additional regiments
                              had been raised by the convention, and congress had
                              been solicited to take the Virginia troops on continental
                              establishment. They resolved to take the six new regiments,
                              passing by the two first; a discrimination which
                              conveys so palpable a reflection on the two first regiments,
                              that it is difficult to account for it, except by
                              the secret influence of that unfriendly star, which had
                              hitherto controuled and obscured Mr. Henry's military
                              destinies. The measure was so exactly adjusted to the
                              wish expressed by colonel Woodford's correspondent,
                              that congress would not devolve the chief command of
                              the Virginia forces on colonel Henry, that it is difficult
                              to avoid the suspicion, that the suggestion came from
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3349"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="192" data-tei-n="179"> </a></span>
                              the same quarter. The convention however, now
                              interfered in behalf of their favorite; and remonstrated
                              against this degradation of the officers of their first
                              choice; earnestly recommending it to congress, if they
                              adhered to their resolution of taking into continental
                              pay no more than six regiments, to suffer the two first
                              to stand first in the arrangement. This course was
                              accordingly adopted; 
                              <hi id="d145581e3351" style="font-style: italic;">but at the same time, commissions
                                 of brigadier general, were forwarded by congress to
                                 colonel Howe and colonel Andrew Lewis
                              </hi>.

                              will not be surprised that Mr. Henry refused

                              offered to him, and immediately resigned that which he
                              held from the state. His resignation produced a
                              commotion in the camp, which wore at first an alarming
                              aspect; and would probably have had an extremely

                                       at continental expense; in answer to which, a letter was
                                       received from the delegates, dated the 30th of December,
                                       of which the following is an extract: ‘The resolutions
                                       of congress for taking our six additional (they
                                       would not agree to take our other two) battalions, into

                                       supplying our countrymen with salt, are enclosed.’ It
                                       was supposed from hence, an intention prevailed in

                                       of the new ones into continental pay; which, as it was

                                       ones of equal rank, was generally thought wrong, since
                                       it would degrade the officers of the two first battalions;
                                       and, to avoid this, the convention came to a resolution
                                       the 10th of January, of which the following is part:
                                       ‘Should the congress adhere to their resolution of taking
                                       into continental pay no more than six battalions, let
                                       it be earnestly recommended to them to suffer our two
                                       present battalions (to be completed as before mentioned)
                                       to stand first in the arrangement; since otherwise, the
                                       officers first appointed by this convention, most of whom
                                       have already gone through a laborious and painful

                                       service, will be degraded in their ranks, and there is too
                                       much reason to apprehend, that great confusion will ensue.’

                                       fixed to allow us but six battalions, you will please to
                                       attend to that part of the resolve which recommends
                                       their being the first six, as a point of great consequence

                                       battalion, with directions to deliver them. Colonel Henry
                                       was accordingly offered his commission, which he
                                       declined accepting, and retired without assigning any reasons.

                                       military operations would be retarded, and that there
                                       would be a considerable murmuring against the
                                       congress; but they are much mistaken. It is true the
                                       soldiers and officers were very unhappy at parting with
                                       so amiable a commander as colonel Henry, and might
                                       be a little imprudent in some expressions on the occasion;
                                       but there is not a man of them who is not so
                                       warmly attached to the glorious cause he is engaged in,
                                       as to serve with alacrity under any commander, rather
                                       than it should suffer. And colonel Henry himself, is a
                                       gentleman of so much honour, and so true a patriot,
                                       that he will never countenance a murmur against the
                                       congress; nay so far from it, that it is highly probable
                                       he will soon be found in that august assembly, urging
                                       with his powerful eloquence, the necessity of prosecuting
                                       the war with redoubled vigour. I am a sincere

                              would seem that the truly respectable and venerable
                              chairman of that committee, came in at the time, for
                              his full proportion of this censure, and that he smarted
                              severely under it: this I infer, from a letter of his to
                              colonel Woodford some time afterwards, in answer to
                              one by which that gentleman had consulted him as to
                              the propriety of his resigning his commission. After
                              having dissuaded him from this step by other topics, he
                              proceeded thus: “I am apprehensive that your resignation
                              will be handled to your disadvantage,

                              courtesy, could have been wrung from him only by the
                              bitterest provocations; and renders it highly probable,
                              that the numerous and enthusiastic admirers of Mr.
                              Henry had implicated this gentleman deeply in the
                              indignities which had recently been offered to their

                              life in its true light, upon the evidence in my possession,
                              has imposed upon me a very painful duty, in regard
                              to Mr. Pendleton. With the justice or injustice
                              of the construction placed upon his conflict in relation
                              to Mr. Henry, I have nothing to do. Even if just, the
                              infirmity of human nature may be easily excused in
                              feeling some uneasiness, at the eclipsing brightness with

                              of affairs in Virginia. It demands, however, no uncommon
                              measure of charity, to believe that what was

                              imputed to envy at the time, proceeded, so far as Mr.
                              Pendleton was concerned, from a single eye to the public
                              good, and a sincere belief on his part, (an opinion in
                              which he was by no means singular,) that Mr. Henry's
                              inexperience in military affairs, made it unsafe to commit
                              to his management the infancy of our war. The
                              people required to be animated by success in the
                              onset; and it was therefore very natural in the committee
                              of safety, on whom the responsibility for the
                              management of the war devolved, to select for the first
                              enterprises, the most experienced commander. Mr.
                              Pendleton was too virtuous a man, and too faithful a
                              patriot, to have yielded consciously to any other motive
                              of action than the public good. His country had fixed
                              its seal upon his exalted character, and the writer of
                              these sketches is much more disposed to brighten than
                              to efface the impression.

                                 conceived himself neglected by younger officers having been put above him,
                                 and preferred to him; particularly in the affair of the Great Bridge, where he
                                 wished to have commanded; but colonel Woodford received that appointment.
                                 He disliked his being kept in and about Williamsburg, and not appointed
                                 to some important post or expedition. He was thus induced to
                                 think he was neglected by those who had the power of appointment. He
                                 therefore resigned.”

                           <p id="d145581e3707">Immediately upon his resignation, he was elected a
                              delegate to the convention for the county of Hanover.
                              The session of that body, which was now coming on,
                              was pregnant with importance. Dunmore had abdicated
                              the chair of government, and the royal authority
                              in the colony was seen and felt no longer, but in acts
                              of hostility. The king had declared, from his throne,
                              that the colonists must be reduced by force, to submit
                              to the British claim of taxation; and the colonists, on
                              their part, had vowed that they never would submit to
                              this prostration of their rights; but on the contrary, that
                              they would hand down to their children, the birth-right
                              of liberty which they had enjoyed, or perish in the
                              attempt. On this quarrel, arms had been taken up on
                              both sides, and the appeal had been made to the God of
                              battles. The war had assumed a regular and settled
                              form; blood had been profusely shed in various
                              parts of the continent, and reconciliation had become
                              hopeless.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e3710">The people being thus abandoned by their king, put
                              out of his protection, declared in a state of open rebellion,
                              and treated as enemies, the social compact which
                              had united the monarch with his subjects, was at an
                              end; the colonial constitution, which could be set and
                              kept in motion only by the presence and agency of the
                              king, or his representative, was of course dissolved; and
                              all the rights and powers of government, reverted of
                              necessity, to their source, the people. These causes
                              produced the convention. It was the organ by which
                              the people chose to exercise the fundamental rights
                              thus thrown back upon them, by the dissolution of the
                              regal government. It was the substitute for the whole
                              government which had been withdrawn, legislative,
                              executive, and judiciary. It represented the whole
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e3712"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="191"> </a></span>
                              political power of the people; and had been expressly
                              elected 
                              <hi id="d145581e3714" style="font-style: italic;">to take care of the republic</hi>. The means of
                              accomplishing this object, were left to themselves, without
                              limitation or restriction on the part of the people.
                              Hitherto, while any hope of a restoration of the original
                              government on just terms, could be entertained, the
                              convention had been satisfied with temporary expedients;
                              the first convention however, had exercised the
                              power of the people in their highest capacity, by adopting
                              a species of constitution and organizing a government
                              under it; thus they erected an executive, under
                              the name of a committee of safety, which the people
                              recognised as flowing directly from themselves. Before
                              the meeting of the convention of 1776 however, it was
                              seen and well understood on every hand, that the contest
                              could not be maintained by the people, without the
                              aid of regular government; and that the political malady
                              of which they complained, could be extirpated in no
                              other way than by applying the knife to the root. The
                              newspapers of the preceding year, contain frequent
                              suggestions of this kind; the impression had now become
                              universal; and the papers present specimens of
                              explicit instructions from the people to their delegates
                              to this effect.<a href="note68" class="ref-external" n="68" rend="sc"> *</a> Thus instructed in the sentiments of

                              Williamsburg. Mr. Pendleton having been elected president,
                              after having thanked the house for the honour
                              done him, addressed them with great solemnity, in the
                              following terms:—“We are now met in general convention,
                              according to the ordinance for our election, at a
                              time truly critical, when subjects of the most important
                              and interesting nature require our serious attention.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e3789">“The administration of justice, and almost all
                              powers of government, have now been suspended for
                              near two years. It will become us to reflect whether

                              we can longer sustain the great struggle we are making,
                              in this situation.” Having then directed their
                              attention to certain specific subjects which required
                              attention, he concluded his short, but impressive address,
                              by exhorting the members to calmness, unanimity, and
                              diligence.

                                 the king and parliament of Great Britain, to restore
                                 peace and security to America under the British government,
                                 and a re-union with that people upon just and
                                 liberal terms, instead of a redress of grievances, have
                                 produced, from an imperious and vindictive administration,
                                 increased insult, oppression, and a vigorous attempt
                                 to effect our total destruction. By a late act, all these
                                 colonies are declared to be in rebellion, and out of the
                                 protection of the British crown; our properties subjected
                                 to confiscation; our people, when captivated,
                                 compelled to join in the murder and plunder of their
                                 relations and countrymen; and all former rapine and
                                 oppression of Americans declared legal and just.
                                 Fleets and armies are raised and the aid of foreign
                                 troops engaged to assist these destructive purposes.
                                 The king's representative in this colony hath not only
                                 withheld all the powers of government, from operating
                                 for our safety, but, having retired on board an armed

                                 alternative left, but an abject submission to the will of
                                 those overbearing tyrants, or a total separation from the
                                 crown and government of Great Britain: uniting and

                                    of independence of the United States, is of itself sufficient to establish
                                    the fact that they are from the same pen. But the constitution of Virginia
                                    preceded the declaration of independence, by nearly a month; and
                                    was wholly composed and adopted while Mr. Jefferson is known to have
                                    been out of the state, attending the session of congress at Philadelphia.
                                    From these facts alone, a doubt might naturally arise whether he was, as
                                    he has always been reputed, the author of that celebrated instrument,
                                    the declaration of American independence, or at least a recital of grievances

                                    from the preamble to the constitution of Virginia. To remove this doubt,
                                    it is proper to state, that there now exists among the archives of this state,
                                    an original rough draught of a constitution for Virginia, in the hand-writing
                                    of Mr. Jefferson, containing this identical preamble, and which was
                                    forwarded by him from Philadelphia, to his friend Mr. Wythe, to be submitted
                                    to the committee of the house of delegates. The body of the constitution is
                                    taken principally from a plan proposed by Mr. George Allison; and had been
                                    adopted by the committee before the arrival of Mr. Jefferson's plan: his
                                    preamble however, was prefixed to the instrument; and some of the
                                    modifications proposed by him, introduced into the body of it.
                                 </p>

                              the house proceeded to elect forthwith the first republican
                              governor for the commonwealth of Virginia. This
                              was the touchstone of public favour. The office was
                              of the first importance; and the whole state was open
                              to the choice of the house. The question was decided
                              on the first ballot. The votes stood thus:

                           <p id="d145581e4037">SHORTLY after Mr. Henry's election as governor, lord
                              Dunmore was driven from Gwinn's island and from the
                              state, to return to it no more; and Virginia was left in
                              repose from every external enemy. No opportunity,
                              therefore, was afforded to the governor to distinguish
                              himself in the exercise of that important constitutional
                              power, which created him the commander in chief of
                              the forces of the state. Duties however, of more
                              importance than lustre, remained for the executive of
                              the state—in keeping up the ardour of the commonwealth
                              in the public cause—in furnishing and forwarding,
                              their quota of military supplies to the grand continental
                              army—in awakening the spirit of the state to the
                              importance of discipline, and preparing the militia for the
                              effectual discharge of their 
                              <hi id="d145581e4039" style="font-style: italic;">routine</hi> of duty—in watching
                              and crushing the intrigues of the tories who still infested
                              the state, and went about clandestinely, preaching disaffection
                              to the patriot cause, and submission to Great
                              Britain—in counteracting the schemes of speculating
                              monopolists and extortioners, who sought to avail themselves
                              of the necessities of the times, and to grow rich
                              by preying on the misfortunes of the people—in short,
                              in eradicating and removing those numerous moral
                              diseases, which spring up with so much fecundity, and
                              flourish so luxuriantly, amid the calamities of a revolution
                              —and in keeping the body politic pure and healthy
                              in all its parts. The numerous and well directed
                              proclamations with which the papers of the day abound,
                              attest the vigilance and energy with these duties

                              were performed. To enter upon a detail of them,
                              would be to write the history of Virginia during this
                              period, instead of the life of Mr Henry; a work wholly
                              unnecessary, since it has been already executed with
                              minuteness and fidelity by an elegant writer,<a href="note71" class="ref-external" n="71" rend="sc"> *</a> whose
                              work will probably see the light before these sketches.
                              I shall confine myself to a few prominent incidents of
                              Mr. Henry's administration, on account of some of
                              which, a degree of censure has been unjustly I think,
                              attached to his character.

                           <p id="d145581e4048">The fall of the year 1776 was one of the darkest and
                              most dispiriting periods of the revolution. The disaster
                              at Long Island had occurred, by which a considerable
                              portion of the American army had been cut off
                              —a garrison of between three and four thousand men
                              had been taken at fort Washington—and the American
                              general, with the small remainder, disheartened and in
                              want of every kind of comfort, was retreating through
                              the Jersies before an overwhelming power, which
                              spread terror, desolation, and death, on every hand.
                              This was the period of which Payne in his crisis used
                              that memorable expression—“these are the times which
                              try the souls of men!” For a short time the courage of
                              the country fell. Washington alone remained erect,
                              and surveyed with godlike composure the storm that
                              raged around him. Even the heroism of the Virginia
                              legislature gave way; and, in a season of despair, the
                              mad project of a dictator was seriously meditated. That
                              Mr. Henry was thought of for this office, has been
                              alleged, and is highly probable; but that the project
                              was suggested by him, or even received his countenance,
                              I have met with no one who will venture to affirm.

                              There is a tradition that col. Archibald Cary the
                              speaker of the senate, was principally instrumental in
                              crushing this project; that meeting col. Syme, the
                              stepbrother of col. Henry, in the lobby of the house, he
                              accosted him very fiercely in terms like these:—“I am
                              told that your brother wishes to be dictator: tell him,
                              from me, that the day of his appointment shall be the
                              day of his death—for he shall feel my dagger in his
                              heart before the sunset of that day:” and the tradition
                              adds, that col. Syme in great agitation, declared, “that
                              if such a project existed, his brother had no hand in it,
                              for that nothing could be more foreign to him, than to
                              countenance any office which could endanger, in the
                              most distant manner, the liberties of his country.” The
                              intrepidity and violence of col. Cary's character renders
                              the tradition probable; but it furnishes no proof of Mr.
                              Henry's implication in the scheme. It is most certain,
                              that both himself and his friends have finally and
                              uniformly persisted in asserting his innocence; and there
                              seems to be neither candour nor justice in imputing to
                              him without evidence, a scheme which might just as
                              well have originated in the assembly itself. It was not
                              more than a month afterwards, that 
                              <hi id="d145581e4058" style="font-style: italic;">congress</hi> actually
                              did, with relation to general Washington, very nearly
                              what the Virginia legislature are said to have contemplated
                              in regard to Mr. Henry: they invested him with
                              powers very little short of dictatorial: yet no one ever
                              suspected general Washington of having prompted the
                              measure. Why then shall Mr. Henry be suspected?
                              Neither general Washington himself, nor any other
                              patriot, had maintained the principles of the revolution
                              with more consistency and uniformity than Patrick
                              Henry: and it will certainly never satisfy a fair enquirer,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4061"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="219" data-tei-n="206"> </a></span>
                              to attempt to balance a suspicion, without the shadow
                              of proof, against the whole course of a long and
                              patriotic life. The charge, moreover seems preposterous.
                              What advantage could a rational man promise
                              himself from the dictatorship of a single state, embarked
                              with twelve other sovereign and independent states, in
                              one common cause; a cause too, now so well understood
                              by the whole body of the American people, and
                              in which all their souls were so intensely engaged?
                              The man who was at the head of the armies of the
                              union, might have played the part of Caesar or Cromwell,
                              had he possessed their wicked spirit; but what
                              could the dictator 
                              <hi id="d145581e4063" style="font-style: italic;">of a single state do</hi>, and that too, a
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e4067" style="font-style: italic;">state of firm and enlightened patriots?</hi>
                              
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4071">It is impossible to believe that the legislature themselves
                              could have entertained a doubt of Mr. Henry's
                              innocence; since at the next annual election for governor
                              which took place on the 30th of May 1777, he
                              was re-elected 
                              <hi id="d145581e4073" style="font-style: italic;">unanimously</hi>; the house being composed
                              of nearly the same members, and the same colonel
                              Cary being speaker of the senate. This honourable
                              proof of confidence, by those who best knew the whole
                              case—who watched with a scrutiny so severely jealous,
                              the conduct of our prominent men—and among whom,
                              were some who derived no pleasure from the public
                              honours of Mr. Henry—will be decisive of this question,
                              with every man who is dispassionately searching
                              for the truth, and is willing to find it.

                              legislature, in re-electing him unanimously to the office
                              of governor, affected Mr. Henry most sensibly; and to
                              the committee who announced it to him, he gave the

                           <p id="d145581e4116">It was in the course of this year's administration of
                              the government by Mr. Henry, that that memorable
                              plot which disgraces our history, was formed to supplant
                              general Washington. This is said to have proceeded
                              from the glory which general Gates had gained
                              by the capture of Burgoyne and his army at Saratoga,
                              and was believed to have been suggested by general
                              Gates himself. The plot is said to have been an extensive
                              one, and to have embraced some of the members
                              of congress, and many officers of the army. The
                              high estimate which Mr. Henry had formed of the
                              abilities of general Washington, while that illustrious
                              man was comparatively unknown to his countrymen,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4118"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="221" data-tei-n="208"> </a></span>
                              has been already stated. This estimate, instead of having
                              been lowered, had been confirmed and raised by
                              subsequent events. Mr. Henry was too cool and judicious
                              an observer of events, to have imputed to the
                              commander in chief, the disasters of the autumn of
                              1776. His masterly retreat through the Jersies, the
                              brilliant strokes of generalship exhibited at Trenton

                              of soul with which he braved adversity, had excited his
                              grateful admiration, and established Washington in his
                              heart as one of the first of human beings. He not only
                              admired him as a general, but revered him as a patriot,
                              and loved him as a friend. Feeling for general Washington
                              sentiments like these, the reader may judge of
                              the indignation and horror with which he read the
                              following anonymous letter, addressed to him by one of
                              the conspirators against that father of his county.

                                       you and me together. I recollect with pleasure the
                                       influence of your conversation and eloquence upon the
                                       opinions of this country, in the beginning of the present
                                       controversy. You first taught us to shake off our
                                       idolatrous attachment to royalty, and to oppose its
                                       encroachments upon our liberties, with our very lives.
                                       By these means you saved us from ruin. The
                                       independence of America is the offspring of that liberal
                                       spirit of thinking and acting, which followed the destruction
                                       of the spectres of kings, and the mighty power
                                       of Great Britain.

                                       to fear from our enemies on the way. General Howe,
                                       it is true, has taken Philadelphia; but he has only
                                       changed his prison. His dominions are bounded on
                                       all sides, by his out-sentries. America can only be
                                       undone by herself. She looks up to her councils and
                                       arms for protection; but alas! what are they? Her
                                       representation in congress dwindled to only twenty-one

                                       no more among them. Her councils weak—and partial

                                       or accommodations, and more dying in them in one

                                       submitted daily to general Howe—and more wishing to
                                       do it, only to avoid the calamities which threaten our

                                       exalted merit hath ever been found to attract envy.

                                       just paid us a visit, and by him I learn sundry particulars
                                       concerning general Mifflin, that much surprised
                                       me. It is very hard to trace the schemes and windings

                                       too great to be managed well. A French ship mounting

                                       she ever will have my honest exertions to promote
                                       her interest. I cannot hope that my services have been

                                       the states in general, entertain towards me, gives me the

                              carried on a species of war against the innocent and
                              defenseless, at the bare mention of which humanity
                              shudders. Scarcely a night passed, without witnessing
                              the shrieks of women and children, flying by the light
                              of their own burning houses, from the assaults of these
                              merciless wretches; and every day was marked by the
                              desolation of some farm, by robberies on the highway,
                              or the assassination of some individual, whose patriotism
                              had incurred the displeasure of this fierce and
                              bloody leader of banditti. Every attempt to take them
                              had, hitherto proved abortive; when, in May, 1778, the
                              governor received the following letter from Col. John Wilson:

                                       April, respecting the holding the militia in readiness,
                                       and my attention to the arms and accoutrements, which
                                       I shall endeavour to comply with as far as in my power:
                                       that much however, may not be expected from this
                                       county, I beg to observe, that the militia, of late, fail
                                       much in appearing at musters, submitting to the trifling
                                       fine of five shillings, which they argue they can afford
                                       to pay, by earning more at home; but I have reason to
                                       fear, through disaffection. With such a set of men, it

                                       is impossible to render any service to country or county.
                                       A few days since, hearing of the ravages committed by
                                       Philips and his notorious gang, I ordered fifty men to
                                       be raised out of four companies, consisting of upwards
                                       of two hundred: of those only ten appeared, and it
                                       being at a private muster, I compelled twenty others
                                       into duty, putting them under the command of capt.
                                       Josiah Wilson, who immediately marched after the
                                       insurgents; and that very night one fourth of his men
                                       deserted. Capt. Wilson still pursued, but to no purpose:
                                       they were either taken to their secret places in
                                       the swamp, or concealed by their friends, that no intelligence
                                       could be obtained. He then returned, his men
                                       declaring they could stay no longer, on account of
                                       their crops. I considered, therefore, that rather than
                                       that they should wholly desert, it might be better to discharge
                                       them, and wait the coming of the Nansemond
                                       militia, when I trusted something might be done: but of
                                       those men I can hear no tidings; and unless they or some
                                       other better men do come, it will be out of my power
                                       to effect any thing with the militia of this county; for
                                       such is their cowardly disposition, joined to their
                                       disaffection, that scarce a man without being forced, can
                                       be raised to go after the outlyers. We have lost capt.
                                       Wilson, since his return: having some private business
                                       at a neighbour's within a mile of his own house, he
                                       was fired on by four men concealed in the house, and
                                       wounded in such a manner, that he died in a few hours,
                                       and this will surely be the fate of a few others, if their
                                       request of the removal of the relations and friends of
                                       those villains be not granted, which I am again pressed
                                       to solicit for, and in which case neither assistance, pay,
                                       or plunder, is expected; conceiving that to distress their
                                       supporters, is the only means by which we can root
                                       <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4435"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="232" data-tei-n="219"> </a></span>

                                       assembly with any thing that seemed of too little
                                       consequence for their deliberation. In that view, I have for
                                       some time, considered the insurrection in Princess
                                       Anne and Norfolk. I have from time to time, given
                                       orders to the commanding officers of those counties, to
                                       draw from the militia a force sufficient to quell it.
                                       These officers have often complained of the difficulty
                                       of the business, arising partly from the local circumstances
                                       attending it, but chiefly from the backwardness
                                       and even disaffection of the people. In order to remove
                                       the latter obstacle, I gave orders for one hundred men

                                       county; but I am sorry to say, the almost total want of
                                       discipline in that and too many other militias in the
                                       state, seems to forbid the hope of their doing much to effect.

                                       desired me to give orders accordingly. But thinking

                                       to the assembly, who are the only judges how far the
                                       methods of proceeding directed by law are to be

                              whole case of Josiah Philips. The reader will judge
                              whether Mr. Henry deserves censure for having
                              communicated to the legislature the letter of colonel
                              Wilson; or whether that body acted with too much
                              severity towards a wretch, who had not only set the laws
                              of his counties at defiance, but was ravaging a cruel and
                              dastardly war upon men without arms, upon women
                              and children; and acting, not the part of a brave and
                              open enemy, but that of an enemy of the human family.

                           <p id="d145581e4641">Just at the close of Mr. Henry's administration,
                              Virginia suffered an invasion of a few days under the
                              British officers, Collin and Matthew. They seized
                              fort Nelson near Norfolk, destroyed the naval stores
                              at Gosport, burnt Suffolk, and disappeared, before the
                              militia could be rallied to chastise their insolence. This
                              occurred in the month of May 1779; and the facility
                              and impunity with which the enterprise was accomplished,
                              very probably suggested the more serious invasion
                              of the state, which afterwards took place under the
                              traitor Arnold.

                              Mr. Henry to the office of governor a fourth time,
                              although the constitution declared him ineligible after

                              that his appointment for the first year, not having been
                              made by delegates who had themselves been elected
                              under the constitution, ought not to be counted as one
                              of the constitutional years of service. Mr. Henry,
                              however, had too scrupulous a respect for that instrument
                              to accept the office, even in a doubtful case;
                              and therefore, addressed the following letter to the speaker:

                              his early adversities, had died in the year 1775, after
                              having made him the father of six children. The anguish
                              of this blow was mitigated by the circumstance,
                              of her having been for several years, in a state of ill
                              health and of suffering, from which there was no hope
                              of recovery; and to her, therefore, death indeed, “came
                              like a friend to relieve her from pain.”

                              had lived, however, long enough to enjoy the first bloom
                              of his fame, and to see him the most celebrated and
                              rising character in the state. He had died about the
                              year 1770, and left behind him a name highly respectable
                              for every private and social virtue.

                              1776. Virginia had not hitherto, been the theatre of
                              hostile operations of a very serious character; her
                              sufferings had been rather those of sympathy with her
                              northern and southern sisters; but in this year, the calamities
                              of war were brought home to her own bosom.
                              Arnold's invasion took place in January: having carried
                              his ravages as high up as Richmond and Westham, he
                              retired to Portsmouth, where he rested till April, when
                              general Philips succeeded to the command, and paid
                              another visit of desolation to Manchester. In the next
                              month, came lord Cornwallis, with his victorious army
                              from the south, driving every thing; before him, and
                              striking terror into whatsoever quarter he approached.
                              Having formed a junction between his forces and those
                              under the command of general Philips, there was no
                              longer a military force in the state which had the power
                              to resist him. The inferior body of republican troops,
                              under the marquis la Fayette, moved before him, without
                              the ability to strike a blow; and Cornwallis roamed
                              at pleasure, and without any apprehension, through the
                              interior of the state.

                              for the meeting of the assembly at Richmond. A few
                              members met and took the oaths prescribed by law; but
                              the number not being sufficient to proceed to business,
                              the house was adjourned from day to day until the 10th;
                              when, upon information of the approach of the enemy,
                              they adjourned to the 24th, to meet at Charlottesville.
                              It was not until the 28th, that a house was formed to
                              proceed to business at this place; when Mr. Benjamin
                              Harrison was elected speaker, and after making the
                              usual acknowledgments for that honour, proceeded to
                              address the following remarks to the house; which I
                              quote, not because they are a very favourable specimen
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4794"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="243" data-tei-n="230"> </a></span>
                              of Mr. Harrison's oratory, but to show the panic which
                              prevailed even among the first men of the country.—
                              “The critical and dangerous situation of our country
                              leads me to hope, that my recommending it to you to

                              taken amiss: the people expect that effectual and decisive
                              measures will be taken to rid them of an implacable
                              enemy, that are now roaming at large in the very
                              bowels of our country, and I have no doubt of your
                              answering their expectations; the mode of doing this
                              may indeed be difficult; but it not being my province to
                              point it out, I shall leave it to your wisdom, in full
                              confidence that every thing that is necessary for quieting
                              the minds and dispelling the fears of our constituents,
                              will be done.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4803">Eight days after this address, Mr. John Jouett, a
                              citizen of the place, entered the town on horseback, at
                              full speed, and announced the near and rapid approach
                              of Tarlton, at the head of three hundred cavalry and
                              mounted infantry. The house had just met, and was
                              about to commence business, when the alarming cry of
                              “Tarlton and the British,” was spread through the
                              village; and they had scarcely taken time to adjourn
                              informally to Staunton, when Tarlton rushed like
                              a thunderbolt into the village, in the confident expectation
                              of seizing the whole assembly: but the birds had
                              flown. He made seven of them only prisoners. The
                              rest re-assembled in Staunton, on the 7th of June. On
                              the 10th of June, a false report of his approach produced
                              another panic; and the house having merely taken
                              time to resolve, that they would meet at the Warm
                              Springs, if it should be found dangerous to meet in
                              Staunton on the next day; and on their failure so to do,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4805"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="244" data-tei-n="231"> </a></span>
                              that the speaker might call a meeting, when and where
                              he pleased, again broke up and dispersed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4808">It was at this period of almost hopeless darkness,
                              when the energies of the state seemed to have been
                              pretty nearly paralized, that the project of a dictator was
                              again revived; and it is again highly probable, that Mr.
                              Henry was the character who was in view for that
                              office. Inquiries have been made of the surviving members
                              of that assembly to ascertain whether the project
                              could be traced to him, or whether he had any kind of
                              participation in the proposal; but those inquiries have
                              resulted in a conviction of his entire innocence. The
                              project came from other quarters, and seems to have
                              been the last refuge of that general despair, which,
                              for a short time, pervaded the whole commonwealth.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4811">But this period of deep darkness was the harbinger
                              of breaking day. The morning dawned with the arrival
                              of those aids from France, which Mr. Henry had so long
                              ago predicted; and the sun of American independence
                              arose, to set no more. He lived to witness the glorious
                              issue of that revolution which his genius had set in motion;
                              and (to repeat his own prophetic language, before the
                              commencement of the struggle) “to see America take
                              her stand among the nations of the earth.” The contest
                              closed with the capture of Cornwallis at Little York, on
                              the 19th of October, 1781; and thus, the ball of the
                              revolution rested in the same state in which it had
                              received the first impulse.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4814">This enlightened and patriotic statesman, however,
                              was not yet inclined to indulge himself in that repose to
                              which he was so well entitled. The constitution of the
                              state had as yet been tried only in war, when the sense
                              of common danger; and their ardour in the common
                              cause, might of themselves, have been sufficient to keep
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4816"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="245" data-tei-n="232"> </a></span>
                              the people together, and to supply, in a good degree, the
                              place of government.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4819">It was necessary to see how the instrument would
                              work in peace; what assurance it gave of public order
                              and well regulated liberty; or whether any, and what
                              defects in the plan, required amendment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4823">There were other considerations too, which called
                              loudly for attention. The war had left the country in a
                              most deplorable situation: poor and in debt; its warriors
                              unrequited; its finances wholly deranged; its jurisprudence
                              unsettled; and all its faculties weak, disordered
                              and exhausted. This was no time for the patriot to quit
                              his post. It demanded all his vigilance to guard the
                              infant republic against the machinations of its enemies,
                              both abroad and at home; it required all his care and
                              all his skill to heal the numerous disorders which had
                              flowed from the war; to nurse the new-born nation into
                              health and strength; to develope its resources, moral and
                              physical; and thus to give security and permanence to
                              its liberties.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4826">With the view of contributing his aid to those great
                              objects, Mr. Henry still continued to represent the
                              county of his residence, in the legislature of the state,
                              and controuled the proceedings of that body, with a
                              weight of personal authority, and a power of eloquence,
                              which it was extremely difficult, and indeed, almost
                              impossible to resist. A striking evidence of this power
                              was given, immediately on the close of the revolution, in
                              his advocating the return of the British refugees. The
                              measure was most vehemently opposed. There was no
                              class of human beings against whom such violent and
                              deep-rooted prejudices existed. The name of “British
                              tory,” was of itself, enough, at that period, to throw
                              almost any company in Virginia into flames, and was
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4828"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="246" data-tei-n="233"> </a></span>
                              pretty generally a signal for a coat of tar and feathers;
                              a signal which was not very often disobeyed. Mr.
                              Henry's proposition in favour of a class of people so
                              odious, could not fail to excite the strongest surprise
                              and was, at first, received with a repugnance apparently
                              insuperable. The late judge Tyler, then the speaker of
                              the house, opposed it in the committee of the whole, with
                              great warmth; and in the course of the discussion, turning
                              from the chairman to Mr. Henry, he asked him,
                              “how 
                              <hi id="d145581e4830" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi>, above all other men, could think of inviting
                              into his family, an enemy, from whose insults and injuries
                              he had suffered so severely?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e4834">To this Mr. Henry
                              answered, “that the personal feelings of a politician
                              ought not to be permitted to enter these walls. The
                              question (he said) was a national one, and in deciding it,
                              if they acted wisely, nothing would be regarded but the
                              interest of the nation. On the altar of his country's
                              good, he was willing to sacrifice all personal resentments,
                              all private wrongs—and he flattered himself, that he
                              was not the only man in the house, who was capable of
                              making such a sacrifice. We have, sir, (said he) an
                              extensive country, 
                              <hi id="d145581e4836" style="font-style: italic;">without population</hi>—what can be a
                              more obvious policy than that this country ought to be
                              peopled?—
                              <hi id="d145581e4839" style="font-style: italic;">people</hi>, sir, form the strength and constitute
                              the wealth of a nation. I want to see our vast forests
                              filled up, by some process a little more speedy than the
                              ordinary course of nature. I wish to see these states
                              rapidly ascending to that rank which their natural
                              advantages authorize them to hold among the nations
                              of the earth. Cast your eyes, sir, over this extensive
                              country—observe the salubrity of your climate; the
                              variety and fertility of your soil—and see that soil
                              intersected in every quarter, by bold navigable streams,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4842"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="247" data-tei-n="234"> </a></span>
                              flowing to the east and to the west, as if the finger of Heaven
                              were marking out the course of your settlements, inviting
                              you to enterprise, and pointing the way to wealth.
                              Sir, you are destined, at some time or other, to become
                              a great agricultural and commercial people; the only
                              question is, whether you choose to reach this point, by
                              slow gradations, and at some distant period—lingering
                              on, through a long and sickly minority—subjected,
                              meanwhile, to the machinations, insults and oppressions
                              of enemies foreign and domestic, without sufficient
                              strength to resist and chastise them—or whether you
                              choose rather to rush, at once, as it were, to the full
                              enjoyment of those high destinies, and be able to cope,
                              single-handed, with the proudest oppressor of the old
                              world. If you prefer the latter course, as I trust you
                              do, encourage emigration—encourage the husbandmen,
                              the mechanics, the merchants of the old world to
                              come and settle in this land of promise—make it the
                              home of the skillful, the industrious, the fortunate and
                              happy, as well as the asylum of the distressed—fill up
                              the measure of your population as speedily as you can,
                              by the means which Heaven hath placed in your
                              power—and I venture to prophecy there are those now
                              living, who will see this favoured land amongst the most
                              powerful on earth—able, sir, to take care of herself,
                              without resorting to that policy which is always so
                              dangerous, though sometimes unavoidable, of calling in
                              foreign aid. Yes, sir—they will see her great in arts
                              and in arms—her golden harvests waving over fields of
                              immeasurable extent—her commerce penetrating the
                              most distant seas, and her cannon silencing the vain
                              boasts of those, who now proudly affect to rule the waves.
                              But, sir, you must have 
                              <hi id="d145581e4844" style="font-style: italic;">men</hi>—you cannot get along
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e4847"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="248" data-tei-n="235"> </a></span>
                              without them—those heavy forests of valuable timbers
                              under which your lands are groaning, must be cleared
                              away—those vast riches which cover the face of your
                              soil, as well as those which lie hid in its bosom, are to
                              be developed and gathered only by the skill and enterprise
                              of men—your timber sir, must be worked up into
                              ships to transport the productions of the soil, from
                              which it has been cleared—then, you must have
                              commercial men and commercial capital, to take off your
                              productions and find the best markets for them abroad
                              —your great want sir, is the want of men; and these
                              you must have, and will have speedily, if you are wise.
                              Do you ask how you are to get them?—Open your
                              doors, sir, and they will come in—the population of the
                              old world is full to overflowing—that population is
                              ground too, by the oppressions of the governments under
                              which they live. Sir, they are already standing on tiptoe
                              upon their native shores, and looking to your coasts,
                              with a wishful and longing eye—they see here, a land
                              blessed with natural and political advantages, which are
                              not equalled by those of any other country upon earth
                              —a land on which a gracious Providence hath emptied
                              the horn of abundance—a land over which Peace hath
                              now stretched forth her white wings, and where Content
                              and Plenty lie down at every door! Sir, they see something
                              still more attractive than all this—they see a land
                              in which Liberty hath taken up her abode—that Liberty,
                              whom they had considered as a fabled goddess, existing
                              only in the fancies of poets—they see her here, a real
                              divinity—her altars rising on every hand, throughout
                              these happy states—her glories chaunted by three millions
                              of tongues—and the whole region smiling under
                              her blessed influence. Sir, let but this our celestial

                              the people of the old world—tell them to come, and bid
                              them welcome and you will see them pouring in from
                              the north—from the south—from the east, and from
                              the west—your wildernesses will be cleared and settled
                              —your deserts will smile—your ranks will be filled—
                              and you will soon be in a condition to defy the power
                              of any adversary.

                              Britain—and particularly to the return of the British
                              refugees. Sir, I feel no objection to the return of those
                              deluded people—they have to be sure, mistaken their
                              own interests most wofully, and most wofully have they
                              suffered the punishment due to their offenses. But the
                              relations which we bear to them and to their native
                              country, are now changed—their king hath acknowledged
                              our independence—the quarrel is over—peace
                              hath returned, and found us a free people. Let

                              and prejudices, and consider the subject in a
                              political light—those are an enterprising monied people
                              —they will be serviceable in taking off the surplus
                              produce of our lands, and supplying us with necessaries,
                              during the infant state of our manufactures. Even if
                              they be inimical to us in point of feeling and principle,
                              I can see no objection, in a political view, in making
                              them tributary to our advantage. And as I have no

                              that made the house start simultaneously. It continued
                              to be admired, long after the occasion which gave it

                              incident,<a href="note74" class="ref-external" n="74" rend="sc"> *</a> has favoured me also with the following
                              one, which I shall give in his own words:—“Mr.
                              Henry espoused the measure which took off the restraints
                              on British commerce, before any treaty was
                              entered into; in which I opposed him on this ground,
                              that that measure would expel from this country
                              the trade of every other nation, on account of our
                              habits, language, and the manner of conducting business
                              on credit between us and them: also on this
                              ground, in addition to the above, that if we changed
                              the then current of commerce, we should drive away
                              all competition, and never perhaps should regain it,
                              (which has literally happened.) In reply to these
                              observations, he was beyond all expression eloquent and
                              sublime. After painting the distresses of the people,
                              struggling through a perilous war, cut off from commerce
                              so long that they were naked and unclothed, he
                              concluded with a figure, or rather with a series of
                              figures, which I shall never forget, because, beautiful
                              as they were in themselves, their effect was heightened
                              beyond all description, by the manner in which he acted

                              what he spoke:—‘Why,’ said he, ‘should we fetter
                              commerce? If a man is in chains, he droops and bows
                              to the earth, for his spirits are broken; (looking
                              sorrowfully at his feet) but let him twist the fetters from
                              his legs, and he will stand erect (straightening himself,
                              and assuming a look of proud defiance). Fetter not
                              commerce, sir—let her be as free as air—she will range
                              the whole creation, and return on the wings of the four
                              winds of heaven, to bless the land with plenty.’ ”

                              advocated several measures which deserve particular
                              mention; one of them, on account of the originality
                              and boldness of mind from which it proceeded; and
                              others, because they have sometimes been made the
                              subjects of censure against him. The first, respects
                              the Indians. Those unfortunate beings, the natural
                              enemies of the white people, whom they regarded as
                              lawless intruders into a country set apart for themselves
                              by the Great Spirit, had continued, from their first
                              landing, to harass the white settlements, and hang like
                              a pestilence on their frontier, as it advanced itself towards
                              the west. The story of their accumulated
                              wrongs, handed down by tradition from father to son,
                              and emblazoned with all the colours of Indian oratory,
                              had kept their war fires smoking from age to age, and
                              the hatchet and scalping knife perpetually bright. They
                              had long since abandoned the hope of being able by
                              their single strength, to exterminate the usurpers of
                              their soil; but either from the spirit of habitual and
                              deadly revenge, or from the polices of checking as far
                              as they could, the perpetually extending encroachments
                              of the white men, they had waged an unremitting war
                              upon their borders, marked with horrors which eclipse

                              draw off the attention of the colonists from the usurpation
                              of the British court: and, in the recent war of the

                                    boldness, and ferocity, on the part of the savages, and of heroic and desperate
                                    defense by the semi-barbarous men, women, and children, who were

                                    little boys; of the sometimes total and sometimes partial havoc of families;
                                    of the captivity, tortures, and death, of some; and the miraculous escape,
                                    wanderings, and preservation, of others—would form a book of more interest

                                    would furnish the subject of many a novel, drama, and painting. The
                                    adventure of captain Smith and Pocahontas, if you put aside the dignity of
                                    their characters, is cold and tame, when compared with some which are
                                    related among the western inhabitants of this state.

                           <p id="d145581e4907">A treaty with the Indians, however, was well known
                              to be a miserable expedient; the benefit of which would
                              scarcely last as long as the ceremonies that produced
                              it. The reflecting politician could not help seeing
                              that, in order to remove the annoyance effectually,
                              the remedy must go to the root of the disease-—that
                              that inveterate, and fatal emnity which rankled in the
                              hearts of the Indians, must be eradicated—that a common
                              interest and congenial feelings between them and
                              their white neighbours must be created—and humanity
                              and civilization gradually superinduced upon the Indian
                              character. The difficulty lay in devising a mode to
                              effect these objects. The white people who inhabited
                              the frontier, from the constant state of warfare in which
                              they lived with the Indians, had imbibed much of their
                              character; and learned to delight so highly in scenes of
                              crafty, bloody, and desperate conflict, that they as often
                              gave as they received the provocation to hostilities.

                           <p id="d145581e4910">Hunting, which was their occupation, became dull
                              and tiresome, unless diversified occasionally, by the more
                              animated and piquant amusement of an Indian skirmish;
                              just as “the blood more stirs, to rouse a lion than
                              to start a hare.” The policy therefore, which was to
                              produce the deep and beneficial change that was
                              meditated, must have respect to both sides, and be
                              calculated to implant kind affections in bosoms, which at
                              present were filled only with reciprocal and deadly
                              hatred. The remedy suggested by Mr. Henry was to
                              encourage marriages between these coterminous enemies;

                              the progress of this bill was unimpeded. It passed
                              through a first and second reading, and was engrossed
                              for its final passage, when his election as governor took
                              effect, and displaced him from the floor: on the third

                              if not soundness of policy. Mr. Henry is said to
                              have been extremely sanguine as to its efficacy, and to
                              have supported it by some of the highest displays of his

                              These measures have been frequently stated in conversation,
                              as proofs of a leaning on the part of Mr. Henry
                              towards an established church, and that too, the aristocratic
                              church of England. To test the justness of this
                              charge, the journals of the house of delegates have been
                              examined, and this is the result of the evidence which
                              they furnish: on the 17th of November; 1784, Mr. Matthews
                              reported from the committee of the whole house,
                              on the state of the commonwealth, the following resolution:

                              easy to discern. It would seem to an ordinary mind,
                              that, on the same principle, the Christian religion itself
                              might be chargeable with partiality, since its offers,
                              though made to all, are accepted but by few; and it is
                              very certain that, if Mr. Henry is to be suspected of a
                              bias towards an established church, on account of this
                              vote, the charge will reach some of the foremost and
                              best established republicans in the state, whose names
                              stand recorded with Mr. Henry's on this occasion, and
                              who hold to this day, the undiminished confidence of
                              their countrymen.

                           <p id="d145581e5011">The other measure, the general assessment, proceeded
                              from a number of petitions from different counties of
                              the commonwealth, which prayed, that as all persons
                              enjoyed the benefits of religion, all might be required to
                              contribute to the expense of supporting 
                              <hi id="d145581e5013" style="font-style: italic;">some form of
                                 worship or other
                              </hi>. The committee to whom these petitions
                              were referred, reported a bill whose preamble sets
                              forth the grounds of the proceeding, and furnishes a
                              conclusive refutation of the charge of partiality to any
                              particular form of religion. The bill is entitled, “A
                              bill, establishing a provision for teachers of the Christian
                              religion;” and its preamble is in the following
                              words:—“Whereas, the general diffusion of Christian
                              knowledge hath a natural tendency to correct the
                              morals of men, restrain their vices, and preserve the
                              peace of society; which cannot be effected without a
                              competent provision for learned teachers, who may be
                              thereby, enabled to devote their time and attention to
                              the duty of instructing such citizens as, from their
                              circumstances and want of education, cannot otherwise
                              attain such knowledge; and it is judged such provision
                              may be made by the legislature, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5016" style="font-style: italic;">without counteracting
                                 the liberal principle heretofore adopted and intended to
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5018"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="258" data-tei-n="245"> </a></span>
                                 be preserved, by abolishing all distinctions of pre-eminence
                                 amongst the different societies or communities of
                                 Christians.”
                              </hi> The provisions of the bill are in the
                              strictest conformity with the principles announced in
                              the close of the preamble; the persons subject to taxes
                              are required, at the time of giving in a list of their titheables,
                              to declare to what particular religious society they
                              choose to appropriate the sums assessed upon them,
                              respectively; and, in the event of their failing or declining
                              to specify any appropriation, the sums thus circumstanced,
                              are directed to be paid to the treasurer, and
                              applied by the general assembly, to the encouragement
                              of 
                              <hi id="d145581e5021" style="font-style: italic;">seminaries of learning</hi>, in the counties where such
                              sums shall arise. If there be any evidence of a leaning
                              towards any particular religious sect in this bill, or any
                              indication of a desire for an established church, the
                              author of these sketches has not been able to discover
                              them. Mr. Henry was a sincere believer in the Christian
                              religion, and had a strong desire for the successful
                              propagation of the gospel, but there was no tincture of
                              bigotry or intolerance in his sentiments; nor have I been
                              able to learn, that he had a punctilious preference for any
                              particular form of worship. His faith regarded the vital
                              spirit of the gospel; and busied itself not at all, with
                              external ceremonies or controverted tenets.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5025">Both these bills “for incorporating the protestant
                              episcopal church,” and “establishing a provision for
                              teachers of the Christian religion,” were reported after
                              Mr. Henry had ceased to be a member of the house;
                              but the resolutions on which they were founded, were
                              adopted while he continued a member, and had his
                              warmest support. The first bill passed into a law; the
                              last was rejected by a small majority, on the third reading.

                           <p id="d145581e5030">The same session afforded Mr. Henry a double
                              opportunity of gratifying, in the most exquisite manner,
                              that naturally bland and courteous spirit, which so eminently
                              distinguished his character. General Washington
                              and the marquis la Fayette, both of them objects of the
                              warmest love and gratitude to this country, visited Richmond
                              in November. They arrived on different days.
                              The general entered the city on the 15th, and the
                              journal of the next morning exhibits the following
                              order: “The house being informed of the arrival

                              his late public character, but have, since his return to
                              private life, experienced proofs, that no change of situation
                              can turn his thoughts from the welfare of his
                              country, so his happiness can never cease to be an
                              object of their most devout wishes and fervent supplications.”

                              sensibility. It is worthy of insertion, as showing, in

                              close of hostilities, made his entree on the morning of
                              the 18th of November; and the house immediately on
                              its meeting, came to the following resolution: “The
                              house being informed of the arrival, this morning, of
                              the marquis de la Fayette in this city, Resolved,

                              present to him the affectionate respects of this house,
                              to signify to him their sensibility to the pleasing proof,
                              given by this visit to the United States, and to this state
                              in particular; that the benevolent and honourable sentiments
                              which originally prompted him to embark in the
                              hazardous fortunes of America, still render the prosperity
                              of its affairs an object of his attention and regard;
                              and to assure him, that they cannot review the scenes
                              of blood and danger through which we have arrived at
                              the blessings of peace, without being touched, in the
                              most lively manner, with the recollections, not only of the
                              invaluable services for which the United States at large
                              are so much indebted to him, but of that conspicuous
                              display of cool intrepidity and wise conduct, during his
                              command in the campaign of 1781, which, by having
                              so essentially served this state in particular, have given
                              him so just a title to its particular acknowledgments.

                              lustre of his character, they cannot form a wish more
                              suitable, than that the lesson it affords may inspire all
                              those whose noble minds may emulate his glory, to pursue
                              it by means equally auspicious to the interests of humanity.”

                                       body, permit me to acknowledge, not only the flattering
                                       favour they are now pleased to confer, but also
                                       the constant partiality and unbounded confidence of this
                                       state, which, in trying times, I have so happily experienced.
                                       Through the continent, gentlemen, it is most
                                       pleasing for one to join with any friends in mutual
                                       congratulations; and I need not add, what my sentiments
                                       must be in Virginia, where step by step have I so keenly
                                       felt for her distress, so eagerly enjoyed her recovery.
                                       Our armed force was obliged to retreat, but your
                                       patriotic hearts stood unshaken; and, while either at that
                                       period, or in our better hours, any obligations to you are
                                       numberless; I am happy in this opportunity to observe,
                                       that the excellent services of your militia were continued
                                       with unparalleled steadiness. Impressed with the
                                       necessity of federal union, I was the more pleased in
                                       the command of an army so peculiarly federal; as Virginia
                                       herself freely bled in defence of her sister states.

                                       ever, has devoted me to her. May her fertile soil rapidly
                                       increase her wealth—may all the waters which so
                                       luxuriantly flow within her limits, be happy channels of
                                       the most extensive trade—and may she in her wisdom,
                                       and the enjoyment of prosperity, continue to give the
                                       world unquestionable proofs of her philanthropy and
                                       her regard for the liberties of all mankind.

                           <p id="d145581e5094">Time had now brought forward several new political
                              characters, who had risen high in the public estimation;
                              but Mr. Henry and Mr. Lee still kept their
                              ground, far in the van. A gentleman of great distinction,
                              who began his public career in 1783, found both
                              these eminent men in the house of delegates, and heard
                              them for the first time in debate: he served through the
                              two sessions of that and those of the following year,
                              and has communicated to me so vivid and interesting a
                              comparison of their merits, as they struck his young
                              and ardent mind, that I cannot consent to withhold it
                              from the reader.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5098">“I met with Patrick Henry in the assembly in May,
                              1783: I also then met with Richard H. Lee. I lodged
                              with Mr. Lee one or two sessions, and was perfectly
                              acquainted with him, while I was yet a stranger to Mr.
                              Henry. These two gentlemen were the great leaders
                              in the house of delegates, and were almost constantly
                              opposed: there were many other great men who belonged
                              to that body; but, as orators, they cannot be
                              named with Henry or Lee. Mr. Lee was a polished
                              gentleman: he had lost the use of one of his hands, but
                              his manner was perfectly graceful. His language was
                              always chaste, and although somewhat too monotonous,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5100"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="263" data-tei-n="250"> </a></span>
                              his speeches were always pleasing; yet he did not ravish
                              your senses, nor carry away your judgment by storm.
                              His was the mediate class of eloquence described by
                              Rollin in his 
                              <hi id="d145581e5102" style="font-style: italic;">

                              meandering through a flowery mead, but which never
                              overflowed its banks. It was Henry who was the mountain
                              torrent that swept away every thing before it: it
                              was he alone who thundered and lightened: he alone
                              attained that sublime species of eloquence, also mentioned
                              by Rollin.

                           <p id="d145581e5109">“It has been one of the greatest pleasures of my
                              life to hear these two great masters, almost constantly
                              opposed to each other; for several sessions. I had no
                              relish for any other speaker. Henry was almost always
                              victorious. He was as much superior to Lee in temper
                              as in eloquence; for while with a modesty approaching
                              almost to humility, he would apologize to the house for
                              being so often “obliged to differ from the honourable
                              gentleman, which he assured them was from no want of
                              respect for him.” Lee was frequently much chafed by
                              the opposition; and I once heard him say aloud, and
                              petulantly, after sustaining a great defeat, that “if the
                              votes were weighed instead of being counted, he
                              should not have lost it.”<a href="note78" class="ref-external" n="78" rend="sc"> *</a>

                                 have heard it mentioned by several others who were members of the house,
                                 and particularly by judge Tyler. This gentleman represented it as having
                                 occurred after a division and count of the house, and just as the members
                                 were about to return to their seats. A member who was in the majority,
                                 and who was not very remarkable either for intellect or urbanity, said, with
                                 a coarse laugh, to Mr. Lee, “Well, you see you have lost it.”—Upon which
                                 the latter, looking at him with rather a contemptuous and sneering
                                 countenance, answered, “Yes, I 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5119" style="font-style: italic;">have</hi> lost it; but if votes were

                           <p id="d145581e5153">“Mr. Henry was inferior to Mr. Lee in the gracefulness
                              of his action, and perhaps also the chasteness of
                              his language; yet his language was seldom incorrect,
                              and his address always striking. He had a fine blue
                              eye, and an earnest manner which made it impossible
                              not to attend to him. His speaking was unequal, and
                              always rose with the subject and the exigency. In this
                              respect he differed entirely from Mr. Lee, who was
                              always equal, and therefore less interesting. At some
                              times Mr. Henry would seem to hobble, (especially at
                              the beginning of his speeches,) and at others, his tones
                              would be almost disagreeable: yet it was by means of
                              his tones, and the happy modulation of his voice, that
                              his speaking had perhaps its greatest effect. He had a
                              happy articulation—a clear, bold, strong voice—and
                              every syllable was distinctly uttered. He was always
                              very unassuming, and very respectful towards his
                              adversaries; the consequence was, that no feeling of
                              disgust or animosity was arrayed against him. He was
                              great at a reply, and greater in proportion to the pressure
                              which was bearing upon him; and it seemed to
                              me, from the frequent opportunities of observation
                              afforded me during the period of which I have spoken,
                              that the resources of his mind and of his eloquence
                              were equal to any drafts which could possibly be made
                              upon them.”

                           <p id="d145581e5156">This inequality in the speeches of Mr. Henry was
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5158"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="265" data-tei-n="252"> </a></span>
                              imputed by some of his observers to art. He always
                              spoke they say, for victory, and wishing to carry every
                              one with him, adapted the different parts of his discourse
                              to their different capacities. A critic of a higher
                              order would sometimes think him trifling, when in
                              truth he was making a most powerful impression on the
                              weaker members of the house. By these means, it is
                              said, he contrived to worm his way through the whole
                              body, and to intimate his influence into every mind.
                              When he hobbled, it was like the bird that thus artfully
                              settles to decoy away the foot of the intruder from
                              the precious deposit of her brood; and at the moment
                              when it would be thought that his strength was almost
                              exhausted, he would spring magnificently from the earth,
                              and tower above the clouds.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5162">He knew all the local interests and prejudices of
                              every quarter of the state, and of every county in it:
                              and whether these prejudices were rational or irrational,
                              it is said that he would appeal to them without
                              hesitation, and, whenever he found it necessary, enlist
                              them in his cause. His address on these occasions has
                              been highly admired, even by those who have censured
                              the course as deficient in dignity and candour. It was
                              executed with so much delicacy and adroitness, and
                              covered under a countenance of such apostolic solemnity,
                              that the persons on whom he was operating were
                              unconscious of the design. Winding his way thus
                              artfully through the house, from county to county, from
                              prejudice to prejudice, with the power of moving them,
                              when he pleased, from tears to laughter, from laughter
                              to tears, of astonishing their imaginations, and overwhelming
                              their judgments and hearts, it is easy to conceive
                              how irresistible he must have been. When with
                              these prodigious faculties the reader connects his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5164"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="266" data-tei-n="253"> </a></span>
                              engaging deportment out of the house—the uncommon
                              kindness and gentleness of his nature—the simplicity,
                              frankness, and amenity of his manners—the innocent
                              playfulness and instruction of his conversation—the
                              integrity of his life and the high sense of the services
                              which he had rendered to the cause of liberty and his
                              country—he will readily perceive, that the opinions and
                              wishes of such a man would be, of themselves, almost
                              decisive of any question.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5167">The artifice of resorting to erroneous local
                              prejudices, in a legislative debate, is certainly not to be
                              commended. Truth stands in need of no such aids.
                              It must be admitted that there is more purity, as well
                              as dignity, in supporting a sound measure, by sound
                              arguments only; and we must be prepared to become
                              jesuits, before we can justify a resort to wrong means, to
                              promote even a right end. In excuse of Mr. Henry, we
                              have nothing to urge except immemorial and almost universal
                              usage: and it is moreover, highly probable that many
                              of the instances, in which he was accused of resorting
                              improperly to local prejudices, were cases in which the
                              questions were, from their nature, to be decided in a great
                              measure by local interests. Of this description is the
                              following one, now furnished at my request, in writing
                              by judge Archibald Stuart, from whom I had the
                              pleasure to hear it in conversation several years ago.

                           <p id="d145581e5170">“At your request, I attempt a narrative of the extraordinary
                              effects of Mr. Henry's eloquence in the Virginia
                              legislature, about the year 1784, when I was present
                              as a member of that body.

                           <p id="d145581e5173">The finances of the country had been much deranged
                              during the war, and public credit was at a low ebb:
                              a party in the legislature thought it then high time to
                              place the character and credit of the state on a more
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5175"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="267" data-tei-n="254"> </a></span>
                              respectable footing, by laying taxes commensurate with
                              all the public demands. With this view, a bill had been
                              brought into the house and referred to a committee of
                              the whole; in support of which, the then speaker (Mr.
                              Tyler,) Henry Tazewell, Mann Page, William Ronald,
                              and many other members of great respectability
                              (including to the best of my recollection, Richard H. Lee,
                              and perhaps Mr. Madison) took an active part. Mr.
                              Henry, on the other hand, was of opinion that this was
                              a premature attempt; that policy required that the people
                              should have some repose, after the fatigues and
                              privations to which they had been subjected during a
                              long and arduous struggle for independence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5178">“The advocates of the bill, in committee of the
                              whole house, used their utmost efforts, and were
                              successful in conforming it to their views, by such a
                              majority (say thirty) as seemed to insure its passage. When
                              the committee rose, the bill was instantly reported to
                              the house; when Mr. Henry, who had been excited
                              and roused by his recent defeat, came foward again in
                              all the majesty of his power. For some time after he
                              commenced speaking, the countenances of his opponents
                              indicated no apprehension of danger to their cause.

                           <p id="d145581e5181">“The feelings of Mr. Tyler, which were sometimes
                              warm, could not on that occasion be concealed, even
                              in the chair. His countenance was forbidding, even
                              repulsive, and his face turned from the speaker. Mr.
                              Tazewell was reading a pamphlet; and Mr. Page was
                              more than usually grave. After some time, however,
                              it was discovered that Mr. Tyler's countenance gradually
                              began to relax: he would occasionally look at Mr.
                              Henry; sometimes smile; his attention by degrees became
                              more fixed; at length it became completely so;
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5183"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="268" data-tei-n="255"> </a></span>
                              he next appeared to be in good humour; he leaned
                              towards Mr. Henry; appeared charmed and delighted,
                              and finally lost in wonder and amazement. The progress
                              of these feelings was legible in his countenance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5187">“Mr. Henry drew a most affecting picture of the
                              state of poverty and suffering, in which the people of
                              the upper counties had been left by the war. His
                              delineation of their wants and wretchedness was so
                              minute, so full of feeling, and with all so true, that he
                              could scarcely fail to enlist on his side, every sympathetic
                              mind. He contrasted the severe toil by which
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e5189" style="font-style: italic;">they</hi> had to gain their daily subsistence, with the facilities
                              enjoyed by the people of the lower counties. The
                              latter, he said, residing on the salt rivers and creeks,
                              could draw their supplies at pleasure, from the waters
                              that flowed by their doors; and then he presented such
                              a ludicrous image of the members who had advocated
                              the bill, (the most of whom were from the lower counties,)
                              peeping and peering along the shores of the
                              creeks, to pick up their mess of crabs, or paddling off to
                              the oyster rocks to rake for

                              the house with a roar of merriment. Mr Tazewell laid
                              down his pamphlet, and shook his sides with laughter;
                              even the gravity of Mr. Page was affected; a corresponding
                              chafe of countenances prevailed through the
                              ranks of the advocates of the bill, and you might discover
                              that they had surrendered their cause. In this
                              they were not disappointed: for on a division, Mr.
                              Henry had a majority of upwards of this thirty against the

                              it is) in which Mr. Henry was accused of appealing
                              improperly to local prejudices, the censure seems
                              undeserved. It is obvious that the considerations urged by
                              him, on this occasion, belonged properly to the subject,
                              and that the appeal to local circumstances was fairly
                              made. Candour will justify us in looking, with great
                              distrust, to the censures cast on this extraordinary man,
                              by rivals whom he had obscured.

                              again elected governor of Virginia, to commence his
                              service from the 30th day of the same month. The
                              communication made by him to the first legislature
                              which met after his election, is inserted in the Appendix;
                              it is given at large, as a specimen of Mr. Henry's style
                              in more extended compositions than have yet been
                              submitted to the reader, and for the further purpose of
                              showing, that the objects with which a governor of Virginia,

                              is a circumstance whose frequent and indeed constant
                              recurrence, presses itself most painfully on the attention:
                              I mean the resignation of state officers, on the plea of a
                              necessity to resort to some more effectual means of
                              subsistence. It is not generally known, that the councils
                              of Virginia were, during the period of which we are
                              now speaking, enlightened and adorned by some of the
                              brightest of her sons: much less is it known that they

                              were driven from those councils, by that wretched
                              policy which has always regulated the salaries of officers
                              in Virginia. The letters of resignation, during
                              the years 1784, 1785 and 1786, which now stand on
                              the public files, afford the best comment on this policy.
                              Virginia lost, during those years, the services of such
                              men as have rarely existed in this or any other county;
                              and such as she can never hope to see again in her
                              councils, until the system of penury shall yield to that of
                              liberality. At the close of the war indeed, there was
                              some apology for this penury; the country was wretchedly
                              poor, and in debt. But this cause has long since
                              ceased, and with it also, should cease the effect. Virginia
                              is now rich, and may fill her offices with the flower
                              of her sons; but can it be expected that men who wish
                              to live free from debt, and to leave their families
                              independent at their deaths, will relinquish the pursuits by
                              which they are able to effect these objects, and enter
                              upon a service full of care, responsibility, and anxiety; a
                              service whose certain fruits (if it be their only dependence)
                              must be a life of pecuniary embarrassment, and
                              (what is still worse) their wives and children after their
                              deaths, must be cast on the charity of a cold and unfeeling
                              world? Ought such a sacrifice to be expected?
                              and yet must it not be the inevitable consequence of
                              an exclusive dependence on the salary of any office
                              in Virginia, which requires talents of the highest order?<a href="note81" class="ref-external" n="81" rend="sc"> *</a>

                                 who, having worn out the prime and vigour of life in the service of his country,
                                 instead of being enabled to retire, in old age, to the repose and peace
                                 which he has so justly deserved, is compelled to toil on for subsistence, though
                                 trembling, perhaps, under the weight of eighty winters, oppressed by
                                 debt, harassed by his creditors, with the certainty before him of dying
                                 poor and involved; and leaving his posterity, if he have any, on the
                                 parish! How forcibly does it remind us of that pathetic examination of

                              fall of 1786, while yet a year remained of his constitutional
                              term, Mr. Henry was under the necessity of retiring
                              from the office of governor. There never was a
                              man whose style of living was more perfectly unostentatious,
                              temperate, and simple; yet the salary had been
                              inadequate to the support of his family; and, at the end
                              of two years, he found himself involved in debts which,
                              for the moment, he saw no hope of paying, but by the
                              sacrifice of a part of his estate. Let it be remembered,
                              that this occurred in the year 1786; and let it be further
                              remembered, that the salary was the very nearly what
                              it still remains!

                              proposed to be held in Philadelphia, on the following
                              May, for the purpose of revising the federal constitution.

                           <p id="d145581e5307">The same cause, however, which had constrained
                              Mr. Henry's retirement from the executive chair of the
                              state, disabled him now from obeying this honourable
                              call of his country. On his resigning the government,
                              he retired to Prince Edward county, and endeavoured
                              to cast about for the means of extricating himself from
                              his debts. At the age of fifty years, worn down by
                              more than twenty years of arduous service in the cause
                              of his country, eighteen of which had been occupied
                              by the toils and tempests of the revolution, it was natural
                              for him to wish for rest, and to seek some secure
                              and placid port in which he might repose himself from
                              the fatigues of the storm. This however was denied
                              him; and after having devoted the bloom of youth and
                              the maturity of manhood to the good of his country
                              he had now in his old age to provide for his family.

                              the reply was to this effect: ‘Go back to the bar; your

                              go, I will give you a retaining fee on the spot.’

                              man of Mr. Henry's disposition and habits, at his time
                              of life, and tempest-beaten as he was, to resume the
                              practise of such a profession as the law. He would not,
                              however, undertake the technical duties of the profession;
                              his engagements were confined to the argument of
                              the cause; and his clients had of course, to employ
                              other counsel, to conduct the pleadings, and ripen their
                              cases for hearing. Hence his practise was restricted to
                              difficult and important cases; but his great reputation
                              kept him constantly engaged: he was frequently called
                              to distant courts: the light of his eloquence shone in
                              every quarter of the state, and thousands of tongues
                              were every where employed in repeating the fine
                              effusions of his genius.

                              at Philadelphia, had now come forth, and produced an
                              agitation which had not been felt since the return of
                              peace. The friends and the enemies to its adoption,
                              were equally zealous and active in their exertions to
                              promote their respective wishes; the presses throughout
                              the continent, teemed with essays on the subject;
                              and the rostrum, the pulpit, the field, and the forest,
                              rung with declamations and discussions of the most
                              animated character. Every assemblage of people, for
                              whatsoever purpose met, either for court or church,
                              muster or barbacue, presented an

                              combatants; and in some quarters of the union,
                              such was the public anxiety of the occasion, that gentlemen
                              in the habit of public speaking, converted themselves
                              into a sort of itinerant preachers, going from
                              county to county, and from state to state, collecting the
                              people by distant appointments, and challenging all
                              adversaries to meet and dispute with them, the propriety
                              of the adoption of the federal constitution. All who

                              candidates for popular favour, and especially the junior
                              members of the bar, flocked to these meetings from the
                              remotest distances, and entered the lists with all the
                              ardour and gallantry of the knights of former times, at
                              their tilts and tournaments. Never was there a theme
                              more fruitful of discussion, and never was there one
                              more amply or ably discussed.

                              this instrument in Virginia, Mr. Henry was chosen a
                              member for the county of Prince Edward. Although
                              the constitution had come forth with the sanction of the
                              revered name of Washington, and carried with it all
                              the weight of popularity which that name could not
                              fail to attach to any proposition, it had not the good
                              fortune to be approved by Mr. Henry. He was (to
                              use his own expression) “most awfully alarmed” at the
                              idea of its adoption; for he considered it as threatening
                              the liberties of his country; and he determined therefore,
                              to buckle on once more the armour which he had
                              hung up in the temple of peace, and try the fortune of
                              this, the last of his political fields.

                           <p id="d145581e5356">THE convention met in Richmond on the 2d of June,
                              1788, and exhibited such an array of variegated talents,
                              as had never been collected before within the limits of
                              the state, and such an one as it may well be feared we
                              shall never see again. A few of the most eminent of
                              these statesmen, are still alive; of whom, therefore,
                              delicacy forbids us to speak as they deserve. Their
                              powers however, and the peculiar characters of their
                              intellectual excellence are so well known, that their
                              names will be sufficient to speak their respective eulogies.
                              We may mention, therefore, Mr. Madison, the
                              late president of the United States; Mr. Marshall, the
                              chief justice; and Mr. Monroe, now the president.
                              What will the reader think of a body, in which men
                              like these were only among their equals! Yet such is
                              the fact; for there, were those sages of other days,
                              Pendleton and Wythe; there was seen displayed, the
                              Spartan vigour and compactness of George Nicholas;
                              and there shone the radiant genius and sensibility of
                              Grayson; the Roman energy and the Attic wit of
                              George Mason was there; and there, also, the classic
                              taste and harmony of Edmund Randolph; “the splendid
                              conflagration” of the high minded Innis; and the
                              matchless eloquence of the immortal Henry!<a href="note83" class="ref-external" n="83" rend="sc"> *</a>

                              <p id="d145581e5364"> * The debates and proceedings of this convention, by Mr. David Robertson
                                 of Petersburg, have passed through two editions; yet it is believed, that
                                 their circulation has been principally confined to Virginia; and even in this
                                 state, from the rapid progress of our population, that book is supposed to be
                                 in, comparatively, few hands. Hence it has been thought proper to give a
                                 short sketch of Mr. Henry's course in this body. It ought to be premised,
                                 however, that the published debates have been said by those who attended
                                 the convention, to present but an imperfect view of the discussions of that
                                 body. In relation to Mr. Henry, they are confessedly imperfect; the reporter
                                 having sometimes dropped him in those passages, in which the reader
                                 would be most anxious to follow him. From the skill and ability of the
                                 reporter, there can be no doubt that the substance of the debates, as well as
                                 their general course, are accurately preserved. The work is, therefore, a
                                 valuable repository of the arguments by which the constitution was
                                 opposed on one hand, and supported on the other; but it must have been
                                 utterly impossible for a man, who possesses the sensibility and high relish
                                 for eloquence which distinguish the reporter, not to have been so far
                                 transported by the excursions of Mr. Henry's genius, as sometimes, unconsciously,
                                 to have laid down his pen.

                           <p id="d145581e5371">It was not until the 4th, that the preliminary arrangements
                              for the discussion were settled. Mr. Pendleton
                              had been unanimously elected the president of the
                              convention; but it having been determined that the subject
                              should be debated in committee of the whole, the house
                              of that day, resolved itself into committee, and the
                              venerable Mr. Wythe was called to the chair. In conformity
                              with the order which had been taken, to discuss
                              the constitution, clause by clause, the clerk now read
                              the preamble and the two first sections; and the debate
                              was opened by Mr. George Nicholas. He confined himself
                              strictly to the sections under consideration, and
                              maintained their policy with great cogency of argument.
                              Mr. Henry rose next, and soon demonstrated
                              that his excursions were not to be restrained by the
                              rigour of rules. Instead of proceeding to answer Mr.
                              Nicholas, he commenced by sounding an alarm calculated
                              to produce a most powerful impression. The
                              effect, however, will be entirely lost upon the reader,
                              unless he shall associate with the speech, which I am
                              about to lay before him, that awful solemnity and look
                              of fearful portent, by which Mr. Henry could imply
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5373"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="278" data-tei-n="265"> </a></span>
                              even more than he expressed; and that slow, distinct,
                              emphatic enunciation, by which he never failed to move
                              the souls of his hearers.

                              <p id="d145581e5378">“Mr. Chairman—The public mind, as well as my
                                 own, is extremely uneasy at the proposed change of
                                 government. Give me leave to form one of the number
                                 of those who wish to be thoroughly acquainted with
                                 the reasons of this perilous and uneasy situation—and
                                 why we are brought hither to decide on this great
                                 national question. I consider myself as the servant of
                                 the people of this commonwealth—as a sentinel over
                                 their rights, liberty, and happiness. I represent their
                                 feelings when I say, that they are exceedingly uneasy,
                                 being brought from that state of full security which
                                 they enjoyed, to the present 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5380" style="font-style: italic;">delusive appearance of
                                    things
                                 </hi>. A year ago, the minds of our citizens were at
                                 perfect repose. Before the meeting of the late federal
                                 convention at Philadelphia, a general peace and an
                                 universal tranquillity prevailed in this country—but
                                 since that period, they are exceedingly uneasy and
                                 disquieted. When I wished for an appointment to this
                                 convention, my mind was extremely agitated for the
                                 situation of public affairs. I conceive the republic to
                                 be in extreme danger. If our situation be thus uneasy,
                                 whence has arisen this fearful jeopardy? It arises from
                                 this fatal system—it arises from a proposal to change
                                 our government—a proposal that goes to the utter
                                 annihilation of the most solemn engagements of the states—
                                 a proposal of establishing nine states into a confederacy,
                                 to the eventual exclusion of four states. It goes to the
                                 annihilation of those solemn treaties we have formed
                                 with foreign nations. The present circumstances of
                                 France—the good offices rendered us by that kingdom,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5383"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="279" data-tei-n="266"> </a></span>
                                 require our most faithful and most punctual adherence
                                 to our treaty with her. We are in alliance with the
                                 Spaniards, the Dutch, the Prussians: those treaties
                                 bound us as thirteen states, confederated together. Yet
                                 here is a proposal to sever that confederacy. Is it possible
                                 that we shall abandon all our treaties and national
                                 engagements? And for what? I expected to have
                                 heard the reasons of an event, so unexpected to any
                                 mind and many others. Was our civil polity or public
                                 justice endangered or sapped? Was the real existence
                                 of the country threatened—or was this preceded by a
                                 mournful progression of events? This proposal of altering
                                 our federal government is of a most alarming nature:
                                 make the best of this new government—say it is composed
                                 by any thing but inspiration—you ought to be
                                 extremely cautious, watchful, jealous of your liberty;
                                 for instead of securing your rights, you may lose them
                                 for ever. If a wrong step be now made, the republic
                                 may be lost for ever. If this new government will not
                                 come up to the expectation of the people, and they
                                 should be disappointed, their liberty will be lost, and
                                 tyranny must and will arise. I repeat it again, and I
                                 beg gentlemen to consider, that a wrong step made now
                                 will plunge us into misery, and our republic will be lost.
                                 It will be necessary for this convention to have a faithful
                                 historical detail of the facts that preceded the session
                                 of the federal convention, and the reasons that actuated
                                 its members in proposing an entire alteration of government,
                                 and to demonstrate the dangers that awaited
                                 us: if they were of such awful magnitude, as to
                                 warrant a proposal so extremely perilous as this, I must
                                 assert, that this convention has an absolute right to a
                                 thorough discovery of every circumstance relative to
                                 this great event. And here I would make this inquiry
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5385"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="280" data-tei-n="267"> </a></span>
                                 of those worthy characters who composed a part of
                                 the late federal convention. I am sure they were fully
                                 impressed with the necessity of forming a great consolidated
                                 government, instead of a confederation. That
                                 this is a consolidated government, is demonstrably clear;
                                 and the danger of such a government is to my mind
                                 very striking. I have the highest veneration for those
                                 gentlemen; but, sir, give me leave to demand, what
                                 right had they to say, 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5387" style="font-style: italic;">we, the people</hi>? My political
                                 curiosity, exclusive of my anxious solicitude for the public
                                 welfare, leads me to ask, who authorized them to speak
                                 the language of, we, the people, instead of, 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5390" style="font-style: italic;">we, the states?
                                    States
                                 </hi> are the characteristics, and the soul of a 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5394" style="font-style: italic;">confederation</hi>.
                                 If the 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5397" style="font-style: italic;">states</hi> be not the agents of this compact,
                                 it must be one 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5400" style="font-style: italic;">great, consolidated, national government
                                    of the people of all the states
                                 </hi>. I have the highest
                                 respect for those gentlemen who formed the convention;
                                 and were some of them not here, I would express some
                                 testimonial of esteem for them. America had, on a
                                 former occasion, put the utmost confidence in them; a
                                 confidence which was well placed; and I am sure sir,
                                 I would give up any thing to them; I would cheerfully
                                 confide in them as my representatives. But, sir, on
                                 this great occasion, I would demand the cause of their
                                 conduct. Even from that illustrious man, who saved us
                                 by his valour, I would have a reason for his conduct—
                                 that liberty which he has given us by his valour, tells me
                                 to ask this reason—and sure I am, were he here, he
                                 would give us that reason: but there are other gentlemen
                                 here, who can give us this information. 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5403" style="font-style: italic;">The people</hi>
                                 gave them no power to use their name. That they
                                 exceeded their power, is perfectly clear. It is not mere
                                 curiosity that actuates me—I wish to hear the real,
                                 actual, existing danger, which should lead us to take

                                 those steps so dangerous in my conception. Disorders
                                 have arisen in other parts of America; but here, sir,
                                 no dangers, no insurrection, or tumult, has happened—
                                 every thing has been calm and tranquil. But, notwithstanding
                                 this, 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5408" style="font-style: italic;">we are wandering on the great ocean of
                                    human affairs. I see no landmark to guide us. We
                                    are running we know not whither
                                 </hi>. Difference in opinion
                                 has gone to a degree of inflammatory resentment, in
                                 different parts of the country, which has been occasioned
                                 by this perilous innovation. The federal convention
                                 ought to have 
                                 <hi id="d145581e5412" style="font-style: italic;">amended the old system</hi>—for

                                 to know what danger could have arisen under the
                                 present confederation, and what are the causes of this
                                 proposal to change our government?”

                              from Mr. Randolph; and the debate passed into other

                              to Mr. Henry's opening speech, addressed the chair as

                                 often displayed, have attracted my respect and attention.
                                 On so important an occasion, and before so respectable a

                              again said, rather tauntingly, of Mr. Henry:—“The

                           <p id="d145581e5465">Mr. Henry rising immediately after these sarcastic
                              remarks, gave a striking specimen of that dignified
                              self-command, and that strict and uniform 
                              <hi id="d145581e5467" style="font-style: italic;">decorum</hi>, by which
                              he was so pre-eminently distinguished in debate. Far
                              from retorting the sarcasms of his adversary, he seemed
                              to have heard nothing but the compliments with which
                              they stood connected, and rising slowly from his seat, with
                              a countenance expressive of unaffected humility, he
                              began with the following modest and disqualifying
                              exordium.

                           <p id="d145581e5472">“Mr. Chairman—I am much obliged to
                              the very worthy gentleman for his encomium. I wish
                              I 
                              <hi id="d145581e5474" style="font-style: italic;">was</hi> possessed of talents, or possessed of

                              that might enable me to elucidate this great subject.
                              I own, sir, I am not free from suspicion. I am apt to
                              entertain doubts. I rose on yesterday, not to enter
                              upon the discussion, but merely to ask a question which
                              had arisen in my own mind. When I asked that question,
                              I thought the meaning of my interrogation was
                              obvious. The fate of America may depend on this
                              question. Have they said, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5480" style="font-style: italic;">we, the states</hi>? Have they

                              made a proposal of a compact between 
                              <hi id="d145581e5485" style="font-style: italic;">states</hi>. If they
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e5489" style="font-style: italic;">had</hi>, this would be a confederation; it is, otherwise,
                              most clearly, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5492" style="font-style: italic;">a consolidated government</hi>. The whole
                              question turns, sir, on that 
                              <hi id="d145581e5495" style="font-style: italic;">poor little thing</hi>; the expression,
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e5498" style="font-style: italic;">we, the people</hi>, instead of, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5501" style="font-style: italic;">the states</hi> of America.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5505">He then proceeded to set forth, in terrible array, his
                              various objections to the constitution; not confining
                              himself to the clauses under debate, but ranging through
                              the whole instrument, and passing from objection to
                              objection, as they followed each other in his mind.
                              This departure from the rule of the house, although at
                              first view censurable, was insisted upon by himself and
                              his colleagues, as being indispensable to a just examination
                              of the particular clause under consideration;
                              because the policy or impolicy of any provision, did not
                              always depend upon itself alone, but on other provisions
                              with which it stood connected, and indeed, upon the
                              whole system of powers and checks that were associated
                              with it in the same instrument, and thus formed only
                              parts of one entire whole. The truth of this position,
                              in relation to some of the provisions, could not be justly
                              denied; and a departure once made from the rigour of
                              the rule, the debate became at large, on every part of
                              the constitution; the disputants at every stage, looking
                              forward and backward throughout the whole instrument,
                              without any controul other than their own discretion.
                              Thus freed from restraints, under which his
                              genius was at all times impatient, uncoupled and let
                              loose to range the whole field at pleasure, Mr. Henry
                              seemed to have recovered, and to luxuriate in all the
                              powers of his youth. He had, indeed, occasion for them
                              all; for while he was supported by only three effective
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5507"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="284" data-tei-n="271"> </a></span>
                              auxiliaries, opposed to him stood a phalanx, most formidable
                              both for talents and weight of character; and of
                              several of whom it might be said, with truth, that

                              was 
                              <hi id="d145581e5512" style="font-style: italic;">“in himself a host;”</hi> for at the head of the opposing
                              ranks stood Mr. Pendleton—Mr. Wythe—Mr. Madison
                              —Mr. Marshall—Mr. Nicholas—Mr. Randolph—Mr.
                              Innis—Mr. Henry Lee—and Mr. Corbin. Fearful
                              odds! and such as called upon him for the most strenuous
                              exertion of all his faculties. Nor did he sink below
                              the occasion. For twenty days, during which this
                              great discussion continued without intermission, his
                              efforts were sustained, not only with undiminished
                              strength, but with powers which seemed to gather new
                              force from every exertion. All the faculties useful
                              for debate were found united in him, with a degree of
                              perfection, in which they are rarely seen to exist, even
                              separately, in different individuals: irony, ridicule, the
                              purest wit, the most comic humour, exclamations that
                              made the soul start, the most affecting pathos, and the
                              most sublime apostrophes, lent their aid to enforce his
                              reasoning, and to put to flight the arguments of his
                              adversaries.

                           <p id="d145581e5516">The objection that the constitution substituted a
                              consolidated in lieu of a confederated government, and
                              that this new consolidated government threatened the
                              total annihilation of the state sovereignties, was pressed
                              by him with most masterly power: he said there was no
                              necessity for a change of government, so entire and
                              fundamental—and no inducement to it, unless it was to
                              be found in this 
                              <hi id="d145581e5518" style="font-style: italic;">splendid government</hi>, which we were
                              told was to make us 
                              <hi id="d145581e5521" style="font-style: italic;">a great and mighty people</hi>.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5525">“We
                              have no detail,” said he, “of those great considerations,
                              which, in my opinion, ought to have 
                              <hi id="d145581e5527" style="font-style: italic;">abounded</hi>, before
                              we should recur to a government of this kind. Here
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5530"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="285" data-tei-n="272"> </a></span>
                              is a revolution as 
                              <hi id="d145581e5532" style="font-style: italic;">radical</hi> as that which separated us
                              from Great Britain. It is as radical, if in this transition
                              our rights and privileges are endangered, and the
                              sovereignty of the states be relinquished: and cannot
                              we plainly see, that this is actually the case? The
                              rights of conscience, trial by jury, liberty of the press,
                              all your immunities and franchises, all pretensions to
                              human rights and privileges, are rendered insecure, if
                              not lost, by this change so loudly tolled of by some,
                              and so inconsiderately by others. Is this tame relinquishment
                              of rights worthy of freemen? Is it worthy
                              of that manly fortitude that ought to characterize
                              republicans? It is said eight states have adopted this plan: I
                              declare, that if 
                              <hi id="d145581e5535" style="font-style: italic;">twelve states and an half</hi> had adopted
                              it, I would with manly firmness, and in spite of an
                              erring world, reject it. You are not to inquire how
                              your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e5538" style="font-style: italic;">a great and powerful people</hi>, but how

                              can be secured; for 
                              <hi id="d145581e5545" style="font-style: italic;">liberty</hi> ought to be the

                              of your government. Is it necessary for your 
                              <hi id="d145581e5551" style="font-style: italic;">liberty</hi>,
                              that you should abandon those great rights by the adoption
                              of this system? Is the relinquishment of the trial
                              by jury, and the liberty of the press, necessary for your
                              liberty? Will the abandonment of your most sacred
                              rights tend to the security of your liberty? Liberty,
                              the greatest of all earthly blessings—
                              <hi id="d145581e5554" style="font-style: italic;">give us that precious
                                 jewel, and you may take every thing else!
                              </hi> But I
                              am fearful I have lived long enough to become an old
                              fashioned fellow. Perhaps an invincible attachment to
                              the dearest rights of man, may, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5557" style="font-style: italic;">in these refined, enlightened
                                 days
                              </hi>, be deemed 
                              <hi id="d145581e5561" style="font-style: italic;">old fashioned</hi>: if so, I am contented
                              to be so: I say, the time has been, when every
                              pulse of my heart beat for American liberty, and
                              which, I believe, had a counterpart in the breast of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5564"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="286" data-tei-n="273"> </a></span>
                              every true American; but suspicions have gone forth—
                              suspicions of my integrity—publicly reported that my
                              professions are not real—twenty-three years ago was I
                              supposed a traitor to my country: I was then said to be
                              a bane of sedition, because I supported the rights of
                              my county: I may be thought suspicious, when I say
                              our privileges and rights are in danger: but sir, a number
                              of the people of this country are weak enough to
                              think these things are too true. I am happy to find,
                              that the gentleman on the other side declares they are
                              groundless: but sir, suspicion is a virtue, as long as its
                              object is the preservation of the public good, and as
                              long as it stays within proper bounds: should it fall on
                              me, I am contented: conscious rectitude is a powerful
                              consolation: I trust there are many who think my
                              professions for the public good to be real. Let your
                              suspicion look to both sides: there are many on the other
                              side, who possibly may have been persuaded of the
                              necessity of these measures, which I conceive to be
                              dangerous to your liberty. Guard with jealous attention,
                              the public liberty. Suspect every one who approaches
                              that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve
                              it but downright force: whenever you give up that
                              force, you are inevitably ruined. I am answered by
                              gentlemen, that though I might speak of terrors, yet
                              the fact was, that we were surrounded by none of the
                              dangers I apprehended. I conceive this new government
                              to be one of those dangers: it has produced those
                              horrors, which distress many of our best citizens. We
                              are come hither to preserve the poor commonwealth of
                              Virginia, if it can be possibly done: something must be
                              done to preserve your liberty and mine. The confederation,
                              this same despised government, merits in my
                              opinion, the highest encomium: it carried us through a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5566"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="287" data-tei-n="274"> </a></span>
                              long and dangerous war: it rendered us victorious in
                              that bloody conflict with a powerful nation: it has
                              secured us a territory greater than any European monarch
                              possesses: and shall a government which has been
                              thus strong and vigorous, be accused of imbecility, and
                              abandoned for want of energy? Consider what you
                              are about to do, before you part with this government.
                              Take longer time in reckoning things: revolutions like
                              this have happened in almost every country in Europe;
                              similar examples are to be found in ancient Greece and
                              ancient Rome: instances of the people losing their
                              liberty by their own carelessness and the ambition of a
                              few. We are cautioned by the honourable gentleman
                              who presides, against faction and turbulence: I acknowledge
                              that licentiousness is dangerous, and that it ought
                              to be provided against: I acknowledge also, the new
                              form of government may effectually prevent it: yet there
                              is another thing, it will as effectually do: it will oppress
                              and ruin the people. There are sufficient guards placed
                              against faction and licentiousness: for when power is
                              given to this government to suppress these, or for any
                              other purpose, the language it assumes is clear, express,
                              and unequivocal: but when this constitution speaks of
                              privileges, there is an 
                              <hi id="d145581e5568" style="font-style: italic;">ambiguity</hi>, sir, a 
                              <hi id="d145581e5571" style="font-style: italic;">fatal ambiguity,
                                 an ambiguity
                              </hi> which is very astonishing!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5575">The adoption of the instrument had been maintained
                              upon the ground that it should increase our military
                              strength, and enable us to resist the lawless ambition
                              of foreign princes:—it had been urged too, that if
                              the convention should rise without adopting the instrument,
                              disunion and anarchy would be the certain consequences.
                              In answer to these topics he said—“Happy
                              will you be, if you miss the fate of those nations, who
                              omitting to resist their oppressors, or negligently suffering
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5577"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="288" data-tei-n="275"> </a></span>
                              their liberty to be wrested from them, have groaned
                              under intolerable despotism! Most of the human race
                              are now in this deplorable condition. And those nations
                              who have gone in search of 
                              <hi id="d145581e5579" style="font-style: italic;">grandeur, power</hi>,
                              and 
                              <hi id="d145581e5582" style="font-style: italic;">splendour</hi>, have also fallen a sacrifice, and been
                              the victims of their own folly. While they acquired
                              those visionary blessings, they lost their freedom. My
                              great objection to this government is, that it does not
                              leave us the means of defending our rights, or of waging
                              war against tyrants. It is urged by some gentlemen,
                              that this new plan will bring us an acquisition of
                              strength, an army, and the militia of the states. This
                              is an idea extremely ridiculous: gentlemen cannot be
                              in earnest. 
                              <hi id="d145581e5585" style="font-style: italic;">This acquisition will trample on your fallen
                                 liberty!
                              </hi> Let my beloved Americans guard against that
                              fatal lethargy that has pervaded the universe. Have
                              we the means of resisting disciplined armies, when our
                              only defence, the militia, is put into the hands of congress?
                              The honourable gentleman said, that great
                              danger would ensue, if the convention rose without
                              adopting this system. I ask, where is that danger? I
                              see none. Other gentlemen have told us within these
                              walls, that the union is gone—or, that the union will be
                              gone. Is not this trifling with the judgment of their
                              fellow-citizens? Till they tell us the ground of their fears,
                              I will consider them as imaginary. I rose to make inquiry
                              where those dangers were; they could make no
                              answer: I believe I never shall have that answer. Is
                              there a disposition in the people of this country to revolt
                              against the dominion of laws? Has there been a
                              single tumult in Virginia? Have not the people of Virginia,
                              when labouring under the severest pressure of
                              accumulated distresses, manifested the most cordial
                              acquiescence in the execution of the laws? What could
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5588"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="289" data-tei-n="276"> </a></span>
                              be more awful than their unanimous acquiescence under
                              general distresses? Is there any revolution in Virginia?
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e5591" style="font-style: italic;">Whither is the spirit of America gone? Whither
                                 is the genius of America fled? It was but yesterday
                                 when our enemies marched in triumph through our
                                 country. Yet the people of this country could not be
                                 appalled by their pompous armaments: they stopped
                                 their career, and victoriously captured them!
                              </hi> Where
                              is the peril now, compared to that? Some minds are
                              agitated by foreign alarms: Happily for us, there is no
                              real danger from Europe: that country is engaged in
                              more arduous business: from that quarter there is no
                              cause of fear: you may sleep in safety for ever for them.
                              Where is the danger? If sir, there was any, I would
                              recur to the American spirit to defend us—that spirit
                              which has enabled us to surmount the greatest difficulties:
                              to that illustrious spirit I address my most fervent
                              prayer, to prevent our adopting a system destructive to
                              liberty. Let not gentlemen be told that it is not safe to
                              reject this government. Wherefore is it not safe? We
                              are told there are dangers; but those dangers are ideal;
                              they cannot be demonstrated. To encourage us to
                              adopt it, they tell us that there is a plain easy way of
                              getting amendments. When I come to contemplate
                              this part, I suppose that I am mad, or that my countrymen
                              are so. The way to amendment, is in my conception
                              shut. Let us consider this 
                              <hi id="d145581e5594" style="font-style: italic;">plain, easy way</hi>.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5598">He then proceeds to demonstrate, that as the constitution
                              required the concurrence of three-fourths of the
                              states to any amendment, it followed that six-tenths of
                              the people, in four of the smallest states, (not containing
                              collectively one-tenth part of the population of the
                              United States) would have it in their power to defeat
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5600"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="290" data-tei-n="277"> </a></span>
                              the most salutary amendments; and then asks, “Is this,
                              sir, an easy mode of securing the public liberty? It is,
                              sir, a most fearful situation, when the most contemptible
                              minority can prevent the alteration of the most oppressive
                              government: for it may, in many respects, prove to be
                              such. Is this the spirit of republicanism? What, sir,
                              is the genius of democracy? Let me read that clause of
                              the bill of rights of Virginia, which relates to this: 3d
                              Art. ‘That government is, or ought to be, instituted for
                              the common benefit, protection, and security of the
                              people, nation, or community; of all the various modes
                              and forms of government, that is best which is capable
                              of producing the greatest degree of happiness and
                              safety, and is most effectually secured against the danger
                              of mal-administration; and that whenever any government
                              shall be found inadequate, or contrary to these
                              purposes, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5602" style="font-style: italic;">a majority of the community</hi> hath an indubitable,
                              unalienable, and indefeasible right to reform,
                              alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged
                              most conducive to the public weal.’ This, sir, is the
                              language of democracy; 
                              <hi id="d145581e5605" style="font-style: italic;">that a majority of the community</hi>
                              have a right to alter their government when found to be
                              oppressive; but how different is the genius of your new
                              constitution from this? How different from the sentiments
                              of freemen, that a contemptible minority can
                              prevent the good of the majority? If then, gentlemen
                              standing on this ground, are come to that point, that
                              they are willing to bind themselves and their posterity
                              to be oppressed, 
                              <hi id="d145581e5608" style="font-style: italic;">I am amazed, and inexpressibly
                                 astonished!
                              </hi> If this be the opinion of the majority, I
                              must submit; but to me, sir, it appears perilous and
                              destructive; I cannot help thinking so; perhaps it may
                              be the result of my age; these may be feelings natural
                              to a man of my years, when the American spirit has
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5611"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="291" data-tei-n="278"> </a></span>
                              left him, and his mental powers, like the members of
                              the body, are decayed. If, sir, amendments are left to
                              the twentieth, or to the tenth part of the people of
                              America, your liberty is gone for ever. We have heard
                              that there is a great deal of bribery practised in the
                              house of commons in England; and that many of the
                              numbers raised themselves to preferments by selling
                              the rights of the people. But, sir, the tenth part of
                              that body cannot continue oppressions on the rest of
                              the people. English liberty is, in this case, on a
                              firmer foundation than American liberty. It will be
                              easily contrived to procure the opposition of one-tenth
                              of the people to any alteration, however judicious.”

                           <p id="d145581e5615">Mr. Pendleton had repelled the idea of danger from
                              the adoption of the constitution, on the ground of the
                              facility with which the people could recall their delegated
                              powers and change their servants.—“We will
                              assemble in conventions,” said Mr. Pendleton, “wholly
                              recall our delegated powers, or reform them so as to
                              prevent such abuse, and punish our servants.” In
                              reply to this, Mr. Henry said—

                              are founded; but its defective and imperfect construction,
                              puts it in their power to perpetrate the worst of
                              mischiefs, should they be bad men; and, sir, would not
                              all the world, from the eastern to the western hemisphere,
                              blame our distracted folly in resting our rights

                              liberties of the people were placed on the sole chance
                              of their rulers being good men, without a consequent
                              loss of liberty? I say, that the loss of that dearest privilege
                              has ever followed, with absolute certainty, every
                              such mad attempt.

                              he shall rule his people, and interpose such checks as
                              shall prevent him from infringing them: 
                              <hi id="d145581e5686" style="font-style: italic;">but the president
                                 in the field, at the head of his army, can prescribe
                                 the terms on which he shall reign master, so far that it
                                 will puzzle any American ever to get his neck from

                                 of this idea

                              bail, or do what Mr. Chief Justice will order him. If
                              he be guilty, will not the recollection of his crimes

                              being master of every thing, and being ignominiously
                              tried and punished, powerfully excite him to make this

                                 shall have a king: the army will salute him monarch;

                              reducible to the following heads.

                           <p id="d145581e5716">I. That it was a consolidated, instead of a confederated
                              government: that in making it so, the delegates
                              at Philadelphia had transcended the limits of their
                              comission: changed fundamentally the relations which the
                              states had chosen to bear to each other: annihilated
                              their respective sovereignties: destroyed the barriers
                              which divided them: and converted the whole into one
                              solid empire. To this leading objection, almost all the
                              rest had reference, and were urged principally with the

                              the clauses which authorized congress 
                              <hi id="d145581e5721" style="font-style: italic;">to pass all laws

                              of powers an idle illusion: since by the force of
                              construction arising from that clause, congress might easily
                              do any thing and every thing it chose, under the pretence
                              of giving effect to some specified power.

                              the states were no longer to be required in their federative

                              towards the expenses and engagements of the
                              general government: but congress were authorized to
                              go directly to the pockets of the people, and sweep from
                              them,

                              might suggest. It was contended that such a power
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5730"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="297" data-tei-n="284"> </a></span>
                              could not be exercised, without just complaint, over a
                              county so extensive, and so diversified in its productions
                              and the pursuits of its people: that it was impossible
                              to select any subject of general taxation which
                              would not operate unequally on the different sections
                              of the union, produce discontent and heart burnings
                              among the people, and most probably terminate in open
                              resistance to the laws: that the representatives in congress
                              were too few to carry with them a knowledge of
                              the wants and capacities of the people in the different
                              parts of a large state: and that the representation could
                              not be made full enough to attain that object, without
                              becoming oppressively expensive to the county: that
                              hence taxation ought to be left to the states themselves,
                              whose representation was full, who best knew the habits
                              and circumstances of their constituents, and on what
                              subjects a tax could be most conveniently laid: Mr.
                              Henry said that he was willing to grant this power
                              conditionally; that is, upon the failure of the states to
                              comply with requisitions from congress: but that the absolute
                              and unconditional grant of it in the first instance,
                              filled his mind with the most awful anticipations. It
                              was resolved, he saw clearly, that we must be a great and
                              splendid people: and that in order to be so, immense
                              revenues must be raised from the people: the people
                              were to be bowed down under the load of their taxes,
                              direct and indirect: and a swarm of federal tax gatherers
                              were to cover this land, to blight every blade of grass,
                              and every leaf of vegetation, and consume its productions
                              for the enrichment of themselves and their masters:
                              it was not contended, he supposed, but that the
                              state legislatures also, might impose taxes for their own
                              internal purposes; thus the people were to be doubly

                              sheriffs, to be ground to dust: on this subject he drew
                              such a vivid and affecting picture of these officers,
                              entering in succession the cabin of the broken-hearted
                              peasant, and the last one rifling the poor remains which
                              the first had left, as is said to have drawn tears from
                              every eye.

                              and still more emphatically, the controul given to the
                              general government over the militia of the states, was most
                              strenuously opposed. The power thus given, was a part
                              of the means of that aggrandizement which was obviously
                              meditated, and there could be no doubt that it would
                              be exercised: so that this republic, whose best policy
                              was peace, was to be saddled with the expense of
                              maintaining standing armies and navies, useless for any other
                              purpose than to insult her citizens, to afford a pretext
                              for increased taxes, and an augmented public debt, and
                              finally to subvert the liberties of her people; her militia
                              too, her last remaining defence, was gone. “Congress,”
                              said Mr. Henry, “by the power of taxation—
                              by that of raising an army and navy—and by their controul
                              over the militia—have the sword in the one hand,
                              and the purse in the other. Shall we be safe without
                              either? Congress have an unlimited power over both;
                              they are entirely given up by us. Let him (Mr. Madison)
                              candidly tell me, where and when did freedom
                              exist, when the sword and purse were given up from
                              the people? Unless a miracle in human affairs shall
                              interpose, no nation ever did or ever can retain its
                              liberty, after the loss of the sword and the purse.”

                              this power was opposed, on the ground, that congress,

                              which it possessed, might transfer to the president the
                              power of calling forth the militia, and thus enable him
                              to disarm all opposition to his schemes.

                              jurisdictions of the state and federal courts; and secondly,
                              because infinite power was given to congress to multiply
                              inferior federal courts, at pleasure: a power which
                              they should not fail to exercise, in order to swell the
                              patronage of the president,

                              in civil cases, by that clause which gives to the supreme

                              case: and which thereby enabled that tribunal to annihilate
                              both the verdict and judgment of the inferior
                              courts: and that in criminal cases also, the trial by jury
                              was worse than gone, because it was admitted, that the
                              common law which alone gave the challenge for favour
                              would not be in force, as to the federal courts: and

                              the most formidable features in the instrument: in as
                              much as it put it in the power of the president and any

                              distributing, moreover, throughout the society, a band

                              tax gatherers, which would render him irresistible in

                              that they could not be guarded with too much caution:
                              among these were the liberty of speech and of

                              after day, with all the powers of reasoning and of
                              eloquence: and where argument and declamation were found
                              unavailing, the force of ridicule was freely resorted to.
                              Thus, in relation to the objection of consolidation, Mr.
                              Madison had said, “There are a number of opinions as
                              to the nature of the government; but the principal question
                              is, whether it be a federal or consolidated government.
                              In order to judge properly of the question before
                              us, we must consider it minutely in its principal parts.
                              I conceive myself, that it is of a mixed nature:—it is,
                              in a manner, unprecedented: we cannot find one express
                              example in the experience of the world:—it
                              stands by itself. In some respects, it is a government
                              of a federal nature; in others, it is of a consolidated
                              nature.” He then proceeds to point out and discriminate
                              its federal from its national features. Mr. Corbin,
                              on the same side, expressed himself satisfied with Mr.
                              Madison's definition of the instrument; but begged
                              leave to call it by another name, viz. 
                              <hi id="d145581e5811" style="font-style: italic;">“a representative

                              that case in the following terms:—“there is one example
                              of this violation (of the state constitution) in Virginia,
                              of a most striking and shocking nature,—an example
                              so horrid, that if I conceived my country would

                              thus:—from a mere reliance on general reports,

                                 in the house of delegates informed the house

                              crimes; 
                              <hi id="d145581e5905" style="font-style: italic;">he therefore, moved for leave to attaint him; he
                                 obtained that leave instantly; no sooner did he obtain,
                                 it, than he drew from his pocket, a bill ready written for
                                 that effect; it was read three times in one day

                              to the senate; I will not say that it passed the same

                                 was afterwards actually executed

                              this compatible with the spirit of freedom? This sir,
                              has made the deepest impression in my heart, and I
                              cannot contemplate it without horror.” Now the reader,
                              by adverting to the statement which has been already
                              given of Philip's case, and which is founded on record,
                              will find that there is not one word of this eloquent
                              invective that is consistent with the facts. What makes
                              the case still more strange is, that Mr. Randolph, at the
                              happening of the occurrence to which he alludes, held
                              the double office of clerk of the house of delegates, and
                              attorney general of the commonwealth; in the first
                              character, he had only 
                              <hi id="d145581e5913" style="font-style: italic;">ten</hi> years before, been officially
                              informed, that the bill of attainder had not been founded
                              on report, but

                                 whose resolutions led to the bill in question

                              Mr. Randolph, but all the other members who had
                              occasion to advert to the circumstance, and even Mr. Henry,
                              on whom it is supposed to have been designed to bear,
                              proceed in their several criminations and defences,
                              upon the admission that Philips had fallen a victim to
                              the bill of attainder. Had the incident been of a common
                              character, there would have been nothing strange
                              in its having been forgotten; but it is one of so singular
                              and interesting a nature, that this total oblivion of it
                              by the principal actors themselves, becomes a matter of
                              curious history.<a href="note84" class="ref-external" n="84" rend="sc"> *</a>

                           <p id="d145581e5952">The convention had been attended from its commencement,
                              by a vast concourse of citizens of all ages
                              and conditions. The interest so universally felt in the
                              question itself, and not less the transcendent talents
                              which were engaged in its discussion, presented such
                              attractions as could not be resisted. Industry deserted
                              its pursuits, and even dissipation gave up its objects,
                              for the superior enjoyments which were presented by
                              the hall of the convention. Not only the people of the
                              town and neighbourhood, but gentlemen from every
                              quarter of the state, were seen thronging to the
                              metropolis, and speeding their eager way to the building
                              in which the convention held its meetings. Day after
                              day, from morning till night, the galleries of the house
                              were continually filled with an anxious crowd, who
                              forgot the inconvenience of their situation, in the excess
                              of their enjoyment, and far from giving any interruption

                              to the course of the debate, increased its interest
                              and solemnity, by their silence and attention. No
                              bustle, no motion, no sound was heard among them,
                              save only a slight movement when some new speaker
                              arose, whom they were all eager to see as well as to
                              hear, or when some master stroke of eloquence shot
                              thrilling along their nerves, and extorted an involuntary
                              and inarticulate murmur. Day after day, was this banquet
                              of the mind and of the heart spread before them,
                              with a delicacy and variety which could never cloy.
                              There every taste might find its peculiar gratifications
                              —the man of wit—the man of feeling—the critic—
                              the philosopher—the historian—the metaphysician—
                              the lover of logic—the admirer of rhetoric—every man
                              who had an eye for the beauty of action, or an ear for
                              the harmony of sound, or a soul for the charms of
                              poetic fancy—in short every one who could see, or hear,
                              or feel, or understand, might find in the wanton profusion
                              and prodigality of that attic feast, some delicacy
                              adapted to his peculiar taste. Every mode of attack
                              and of defence, of which the human mind is capable,
                              in decorous debate—every species of weapon and
                              armour; offensive and defensive, that could be used with
                              advantage, from the Roman javelin to the Parthian
                              arrow, from the cloud of Aeneas, to the shield of
                              Achilles—all that could be accomplished by human
                              strength, and almost more than human activity, was
                              seen exhibited on that celebrated floor. Nor did the
                              debate become oppressive by its unvarying formality.
                              The stateliness and sternness of extended argument,
                              were frequently relieved by quick and animated dialogue.
                              Sometimes the conversation would become
                              familiar and friendly. The combatants themselves,
                              would seem pleased with this relief; forget that they
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5962"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="308" data-tei-n="295"> </a></span>
                              were enemies, and by a sort of informal truce, put off
                              their armour, and sit down amicably together to repose,
                              as it were, in the shade of the same tree. By this agreeable
                              intermixture of colloquial sprightliness and brilliancy,
                              with profound, and learned, and vigorous argument
                              —of social courtesy with heroic gallantry, the audience,
                              far from being fatigued with the discussion, looked
                              with regret to the hour of adjournment.

                           <p id="d145581e5965">In this great competition of talents, Mr. Henry's
                              powers of debate still shone pre-eminent. They were
                              now exhibiting themselves in a new aspect. Hitherto
                              his efforts, however splendid, had been comparatively
                              short and occasional. In the house of burgesses in
                              1765, in the congress of 1774, and the state convention
                              of 1775, he had exhibited the impetuous charge of the
                              gallant Francis the first: but now, in combination with
                              fiery force, he was displaying all the firm and dauntless
                              constancy of Charles the fifth. No shock of his adversaries
                              could move him from his ground. His resources
                              never failed. His eloquence was poured from inexhaustible
                              fountains, and assumed every variety of hue and
                              form and motion, which could delight or persuade,
                              instruct or astonish. Sometimes it was the limpid rivulet,
                              sparkling down the mountain's side, and winding its silver
                              course between margins of moss—then gradually
                              swelling to a bolder stream, it roared in the headlong
                              cataract, and spread its rainbows to the sun—now, it
                              flowed on in tranquil majesty, like a river of the west,
                              rejecting from its polished surface, forest, and cliff, and
                              sky—anon, it was the angry ocean, chafed by the tempest,
                              hanging its billows, with deafening clamours,
                              among the cracking shrouds, or hurting them in sublime
                              defiance, at the storm that frowned above.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e5968">Towards the close of the session, an incident occured
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5970"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="309" data-tei-n="296"> </a></span>
                              of a character so extraordinary as to deserve
                              particular notice. The question of adoption or rejection
                              was now approaching. The decision was still uncertain,
                              and every mind and every heart was filled with
                              anxiety. Mr. Henry partook most deeply of this feeling;
                              and while engaged, as it were, in his last effort,
                              availed himself of the strong sensation which he knew
                              to pervade the house, and made an appeal to it which,
                              in point of sublimity, has never been surpassed in any
                              age or country of the world. After describing, in
                              accents which spoke to the soul, and to which every
                              other bosom deeply responded, the awful immensity of
                              the question to the present and future generations, and
                              the throbbing apprehensions with which he looked to
                              the issue, he passed from the house and from the
                              earth, and looking, as he said, “beyond that horizon
                              which binds mortal eyes,” he pointed—with a countenance
                              and action that made the blood run back upon
                              the aching heart—to those celestial beings, who were
                              hovering over the scene, and waiting with anxiety, for a
                              decision which involved the happiness or misery of more
                              than half the human race. To those beings—with the
                              same thrilling look and action—he had just addressed
                              an invocation, that made every nerve shudder with
                              supernatural horror—when lo! a storm, at that instant
                              arose, which shook the whole building, and the spirits
                              whom he had called, seemed to have come at his bidding.
                              Nor did his eloquence, or the storm, immediately
                              cease—but, availing himself of the incident, with a
                              master's art, he seemed to mix in the fight of his aetherial
                              auxiliaries, and “rising on the wings of the tempest, to
                              seize upon the artillery of Heaven, and direct its fiercest
                              thunders against the heads of his adversaries.” The
                              scene became insupportable; and the house rose, without
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e5972"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="310" data-tei-n="297"> </a></span>
                              the formality of adjournment, the members rushing
                              from their seats with precipitation and confusion.<a href="note85" class="ref-external" n="85" rend="sc"> *</a>
                              But all his efforts were in vain. Either the justice
                              of the opposing causes or the powers of his adversaries,
                              or the prejudged opinions and instructions of the members
                              rendered his reasoning and his eloquence equally
                              unavailing. Out of a house, composed of one hundred
                              and sixty-eight members, the question of ratification was
                              carried by a majority of ten. Mr. Henry himself, seemed
                              to have a presage of this result. After the storm
                              which has been mentioned, colonel Innis, who, in his
                              character of attorney general, had been hitherto attending
                              a court of 
                              <hi id="d145581e5977" style="font-style: italic;">oyer</hi> and 
                              <hi id="d145581e5980" style="font-style: italic;">terminer</hi>, came into the house,
                              and the debate was renewed. Mr. Henry, in answering

                                 heard. If I shall be in the minority, I shall have those
                                 painful sensations which arise from a conviction of
                                 being overpowered in a good cause. Yet, I will be a

                                 shall be free to retrieve the loss of liberty, and remove
                                 the defects of that system, in a

                                       voted against the side of the question, supported by Mr. Henry. The incident

                                       were witnesses of the scene; and by comparing it with the corresponding

                                 yet gone; nor the cause of those who are attached to
                                 the revolution, yet lost—I shall therefore patiently

                              the arguments by which they had been supported,
                              although they had not succeeded in preventing the
                              ratification of the constitution, had produced a very serious
                              effect on the house. Before their final dissolution,
                              they agreed to a bill of rights, and a series of amendments
                              (twenty in number) embracing and providing for
                              the objections of Mr. Henry and his associates. A copy
                              of these amendments engrossed on parchment, and signed
                              by the president of the convention, was ordered to
                              be transmitted to congress, together with the instrument
                              of ratification. Similar copies were ordered to
                              be transmitted to the executives and legislatures of the
                              several states; and fifty copies of the ratification and
                              proposed amendments, were ordered to be struck
                              for the use of each county in this commonwealth.

                           <p id="d145581e6004">Mr. Henry lost no ground with the people, at the time,
                              for the part which he had taken on this occasion: and
                              when afterwards the constitution began to develope its
                              tendencies by practical operation, so many of his
                              predictions were believed by a majority of the people of
                              Virginia to be fulfilled, and so many more in a rapid
                              prowess of fulfillment, that his character for political
                              penetration rose higher than ever. That he had lost
                              no ground at the time, two signal proofs were given in
                              the session of assembly immediately following that of
                              the convention. The latter body rose on the 27th of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6006"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="312" data-tei-n="299"> </a></span>
                              June, and the assembly met on the 20th of October
                              following. This interval had been too short to permit
                              the subsidence of that high excitement, which the canvass
                              of the constitution had provoked; and the assembly
                              was consequently discriminated by feelings of party as
                              strong and determined, as those which had characterized
                              the convention itself.

                           <p id="d145581e6010">The constitution having been adopted by a sufficient
                              number of states to carry it into effect, it became necessary
                              at this session, to provide for its organization, and,
                              among other measures, to choose two senators to represent
                              this state, in the congress of the United States.
                              For this office, Mr. Madison was presented by those who
                              were at that time distinguished by the appellation of
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6012" style="font-style: italic;">federalists</hi>; by which nothing more was then meant,
                              than that they were advocates for the adoption of the
                              new federal constitution. The anti-federalists, on the
                              contrary, who were alarmed by the vast powers which
                              they considered as granted by the constitution, regarded
                              it as a salutary check on the constructive extension of
                              those powers, and as the best means of securing those
                              amendments which they deemed essential to the liberties
                              of the people, that the first congress should be
                              composed of men of their own sentiments. In opposition
                              to Mr. Madison therefore, Mr. Henry took the
                              unusual liberty of nominating two candidates, Mr.
                              Richard E. Lee and Mr. Grayson; and, notwithstanding
                              the great accession of character which Mr. Madison
                              had acquired by the ability with which he had espoused
                              the ratification of the constitution, those gentlemen
                              were elected by a considerable majority.

                                 imperfections might exist in the constitution, ought
                                 rather to be examined in the mode prescribed therein,
                                 than to bring the union into danger by a delay, with a
                                 hope of obtaining amendments previous to the ratification.’
                                 And whereas, in pursuance of the said declaration,
                                 the same convention did, by their subsequent act
                                 of the 27th of June aforesaid, agree to such amendments
                                 to the said constitution of the government for

                                 spirit of those amendments as far as the said constitution
                                 would admit:

                           <p id="d145581e6061">On this proposal of amendment, a very animated
                              debate ensued, which resulted in its rejection, and the
                              adoption of the original report, by a majority of more
                              than two for one.

                           <p id="d145581e6064">These two measures—the election of the senators
                              named by Mr. Henry, in opposition to so formidable a
                              competitor as Mr. Madison—and the carrying so strong
                              a measure, as the call of a new continental convention,
                              for the purpose of revising and altering the constitution—
                              certainly furnish the most decisive proof, that his influence
                              remained unimpaired by the part which he had
                              taken in the convention of the state.

                           <p id="d145581e6067">It was in the course of the debate which has been
                              just mentioned, that Mr. Henry was driven from his
                              usual 
                              <hi id="d145581e6069" style="font-style: italic;">decorum</hi> into a retaliation, that became a theme
                              of great public merriment at the time, and has continued
                              ever since, one of the most popular anecdotes that
                              relate to him. He had insisted it seems, with great
                              force, that the speedy adoption of the amendments was
                              the only measure that could secure the great and
                              unalienable rights of the freemen of this country—that the
                              people were known to be exceedingly anxious for this
                              measure—that it was the only step which could reconcile
                              them to the new constitution—and assure that public
                              contentment, security and confidence, which were the
                              sole objects of government, and without which no
                              government could stand—that whatever might be the
                              individual sentiments of gentlemen, yet the wishes of
                              the people, the fountain of all authority, being known,
                              they were bound to conform to those wishes—that, for
                              his own path, he considered 
                              <hi id="d145581e6072" style="font-style: italic;">his</hi> opinion as nothing,
                              when opposed to those of his constituents; and that he
                              was ready and willing, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6075" style="font-style: italic;">at all times</hi> and

                              </hi>—A young gentleman, on the federal side of
                              the house, who had been a member of the late convention,
                              and had in that body, received, on one occasion, a
                              slight touch of Mr. Henry's lash, resolved now, in an
                              ill-fated moment, to make a set charge upon the veteran,
                              and brave him to the combat. He possessed fancy,
                              a graceful address, and an easy, sprightly elocution; and
                              had been sent by his father (an opulent man, and an
                              officer of high rank and trust under the regal government)
                              to finish his education in the colleges of England,
                              and acquire the polish of the court of St. James; 
                              <hi id="d145581e6083" style="font-style: italic;">where
                                 he had passed the whole period of the American revolution
                              </hi>.
                              Returning with advantages which were rare in
                              this country; and with the confidence natural to his
                              years; presuming a little too far upon those advantages,
                              he seized upon the words, “bow to the majesty of the
                              people,” which Mr. Henry had used, and rung the
                              changes upon them with considerable felicity. He denied
                              the solicitude of the people for the amendments,
                              so strenuously urged on the other side; he insisted that
                              the people thought their “
                              <hi id="d145581e6087" style="font-style: italic;">great and unalienable rights</hi>”
                              sufficiently secured by the convention which they had
                              adopted; that the preamble of the constitution itself,
                              which was now to be considered as the language of the
                              people, declared its object to be among others, the
                              security of those very rights; the people then, declare the
                              constitution the guaranty of their rights, while the gentleman,
                              in opposition to this public declaration of their
                              sentiments, insists upon 
                              <hi id="d145581e6090" style="font-style: italic;">his amendments</hi>, as furnishing
                              that guaranty; yet the gentleman tells us, that “he bows
                              to the majesty of the people:” these words he accompanied
                              with a most graceful bow. “The gentleman,
                              he proceeded, “had set himself in opposition to the will
                              of the people, throughout the whole course of this
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6093"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="318" data-tei-n="305"> </a></span>
                              transaction: the people approved of the constitution: the
                              suffrage of their constituents in the last convention, had
                              proven it—the people wished, most anxiously wished,
                              the adoption of the constitution, as the only means of
                              saving the credit and the honour of the country, and
                              producing the stability of the union: the gentleman, on
                              the contrary, had placed himself at the head of those
                              who opposed its adoption—
                              <hi id="d145581e6095" style="font-style: italic;">yet, the gentleman is ever
                                 ready and willing, at all times and on all occasions,
                                 “to bow to the majesty of the people:
                              </hi>” (with another
                              profound and graceful bow.) Thus he proceeded,
                              through a number of animated sentences, winding up
                              each one with the same words, sarcastically repeated,
                              and the accompaniment of the same graceful obeisance.
                              Among other things, he said, “it was of little importance,
                              whether a country was ruled by a despot, with a
                              tiara on his head, or by a demagogue in a red cloak, a
                              card-bare wig, &amp;c.” (describing Mr. Henry's dress so
                              minutely, as to draw every eye upon him) “although he
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6098" style="font-style: italic;">should profess on all occasions, to bow to the majesty
                                 of the people
                              </hi>.” A gentleman who was present, and
                              who, struck with the singularity of the attack, had the
                              curiosity to number the vibrations on those words, and
                              the accompanying action, states that he counted 
                              <hi id="d145581e6101" style="font-style: italic;">thirteen</hi>
                              of the most graceful bows he had ever beheld. The
                              friends of Mr. Henry, considered such an attack on a
                              man of his years and high character, as very little short
                              of sacrilege; on the other side of the house, there was,
                              indeed, a smothered sort of dubious laugh, in which
                              there seemed to be at least as much apprehension as
                              enjoyment. Mr. Henry had heard the whole of it,
                              without any apparent mark of attention. The young
                              gentleman having finished his philippic, very much at
                              least to his own satisfaction, took his seat, with the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6105"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="319" data-tei-n="306"> </a></span>
                              gayest expression of triumph in his countenance—
                              “
                              <hi id="d145581e6107" style="font-style: italic;">

                              Mr. Henry raised himself up, heavily and with affected
                              awkwardness—“Mr. Speaker;” said he, “I am a plain
                              man, and have been educated altogether in Virginia.
                              My whole life has been spent among planters and other
                              plain men of similar education, who have never had
                              the advantage of that polish, which a court alone can
                              give, and which the gentleman over the way, has so
                              happily acquired; indeed sir, the gentleman's employments,
                              and mine (in common with the great mass of his
                              countrymen) have been as widely different as our fortunes;
                              for while that gentleman was availing himself of
                              the opportunity which a splendid fortune afforded him,
                              of acquiring a foreign education, mixing among the
                              great, attending levees and courts, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6113" style="font-style: italic;">basking in the
                                 beams of royal favour at St. James'
                              </hi>, and exchanging
                              courtesies with crowned heads, I was engaged in the
                              arduous toils of the revolution; and was probably as far
                              from thinking of acquiring those polite accomplishments
                              which the gentleman has so successfully cultivated, as
                              that gentleman 
                              <hi id="d145581e6116" style="font-style: italic;">then</hi> was, from sharing in the toils and
                              dangers in which 
                              <hi id="d145581e6119" style="font-style: italic;">his unpolished countrymen</hi> were engaged.
                              I will not therefore, presume to vie with the
                              gentleman, in those courtly accomplishments, of which
                              he has just given the house so agreeable a specimen,
                              yet such a bow as I can make, shall be ever at the
                              service of the people”—herewith, although there was no
                              man who could make a more graceful bow than Mr.
                              Henry, he made one so ludicrously awkward and clownish,
                              as took the house by surprise, and put them into a
                              roar of laughter—“the gentleman, I hope, will commiserate
                              the disadvantages of education under which I
                              have laboured, and will be pleased to remember, that I

                              have never been a favourite with that monarch, whose
                              gracious smile he has had the happiness to enjoy.” He
                              pursued this contrast of situations and engagements, for
                              fifteen or twenty minutes, without a smile, and without
                              the smallest token of resentment, either in countenance
                              expression or manner. “You would almost have
                              sworn,” says a correspondent, “that he thought himself
                              making his apology for his own awkwardness, before a
                              full drawing-room at St. James'. I believe there was
                              not a person that heard him, the sufferer himself
                              excepted, who did not feel every risible nerve affected.
                              His adversary mean time, hung down his head, and
                              sinking lower and lower, until he was almost concealed
                              behind the interposing forms, submitted to the discipline
                              as quietly as a Russian malefactor, who had
                              been beaten with the knout, till all sense of feeling was lost.”

                                 the congress of the United States, in the following

                                 that were necessary for carrying it into effect. Having
                                 thus shown themselves obedient to the voice of
                                 their constituents, all America will find, that so far as it
                                 depends on them, that plan of government will be carried
                                 into immediate operation. But the sense of the

                                 and but little regarded, if we went no further. In the
                                 very moment of adoption, and coeval with the ratification
                                 of the new plan of government, the general voice
                                 of the convention of this state, pointed to objects no
                                 less interesting to the people we represent, and equally
                                 entitled to your attention. At the same time, that from
                                 motives of affection for our sister states, the convention
                                 yielded their assent to the ratification, they gave the
                                 most unequivocal proofs, that they dreaded its operation
                                 under the present form.

                                 opinion, as those objections were not founded on

                                 hath presented an alternative, by admitting the

                                       propriety of immediately calling a convention of the
                                       states, to take into consideration the defects of the
                                       constitution was admitted; and in consequence thereof, an
                                       application agreed to to be presented to the congress
                                       so soon as it shall be convened, for the accomplishment
                                       of that important end. We herewith transmit to your
                                       excellency, a copy of this application, which we request
                                       may be laid before your assembly at their next meeting.
                                       We take occasion to express our most earnest wishes,
                                       that it may obtain the approbation of New-York, and
                                       of all other sister states.”

                                       the federal constitution, expressed a desire that many

                                       should be amended—the general assembly, as well from

                                       a sense of duty as a conviction of its defects, have
                                       thought proper to take the earliest measures in their
                                       power, for the accomplishment of this important object.
                                       They have accordingly, agreed upon an application to be
                                       presented to the congress, so soon as it shall be assembled,
                                       requesting that honourable body to call a convention of
                                       deputies from the several states, to take the same into
                                       their consideration, and report such amendments, as they
                                       shall find best calculated to answer the purpose. As we
                                       conceive that all the good people of the United States
                                       are equally interested in obtaining those amendments
                                       that have been proposed, we trust that there will be
                                       an harmony in their sentiments and measures, upon
                                       this very interesting subject. We herewith transmit

                              continued a member of the assembly, I find nothing
                              worthy of particular remark. In the spring of 1791,
                              he declined a re-election, with the purpose of bidding
                              a final adieu to public life: and although the tender of
                              the most honourable appointments, the solicitations of
                              his numerous friends and admirers, and ultimately, his
                              own wishes conspired to draw him from his retreat, he
                              never again made his appearance in a public character.

                           <p id="d145581e6212">MR. HENRY still continued, however, rather through
                              necessity than choice, the practise of the law: and in
                              the fall of this year, 1791, a cause came on, to be argued
                              before the circuit court of the United States, in which
                              he made what has been considered his most distinguished
                              display of professional talents. This was the
                              celebrated case of the British debts; a case in which,
                              from its great and extensive interest, the whole power
                              of the bar of Virginia was embarked, and which was
                              dismissed with so much learning, argument, and eloquence,
                              as to have placed that bar, in the estimation of
                              the federal judges, (if the reports of the day may be
                              accredited,) above all others in the United States.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6215">The cause was argued first in 1791, before judges
                              Johnson and Blair, of the supreme court, and Griffin,
                              judge of the district; and aftewards in 1793, before
                              judges Jay and Iredell, and the same district judge. Mr.
                              Henry was one of the counsel for the defendant, and
                              argued the cause on both occasions. The deep interest
                              of the question in a national point of view, and the
                              manner in which it involved more particularly, the honour
                              of the state of Virginia, and the fortunes of her
                              citizens, had excited Mr. Henry to a degree of preparation
                              which he had never before made; and he came
                              forth on this occasion, a perfect master of every principle
                              of law, national and municipal, which touched the
                              subject of investigation in the most distant point.

                           <p id="d145581e6218">Of the first argument, a manuscript report is still
                              extant, taken in short-hand by Mr. Robertson, the same
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6220"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="326" data-tei-n="313"> </a></span>
                              gentleman who reported the debates of the convention
                              of Virginia, in 1788. The second argument was not
                              reported; because, as Mr. Robertson states, he was
                              informed by the counsel, that it would be nothing more
                              than a repetition of the first; and he adds, that he was
                              afterwards told it was much inferior. What must we
                              conclude, then, as to the powers displayed by Mr. Henry
                              in the first argument, when, in the course of the second
                              and inferior one, he extorted from judge Iredell, as he
                              sat on the bench, the exclamation—“Gracious God!—
                              he is an 
                              <hi id="d145581e6222" style="font-style: italic;">orator, indeed</hi>!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6227">The report of the first argument, as deciphered by
                              Mr. Robertson, from his stenographic notes, has been
                              obligingly submitted to the author of these sketches
                              and he has extracted from it an imperfect analysis of
                              Mr. Henry's speech. The report may unquestionably
                              be relied on, so far as it professes to state the principles
                              of law, and the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6229" style="font-style: italic;">substance</hi> of the arguments, urged
                              by the very eminent counsel engaged in the cause; and
                              in this point of view, it is to be lamented that so valuable
                              a work should still exist only in the form of a manuscript.
                              But, as a sample of Mr. Henry's peculiar and
                              inimitable eloquence, it is subject to all the objections
                              which have been already urged to the printed debates
                              of the Virginia convention. This manuscript report
                              bears upon its face the most conclusive proof of its
                              inaccuracy in those passages, in which it attempts to
                              exhibit either the captivating flights of Mr. Henry's
                              fancy, or those unexpected and overwhelming assaults
                              which he made upon the hearts of his judges; for in
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6232" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> such passages, (it is believed, without an exception,)
                              the pen has been drawn through the sentence, as originally
                              written, in such a manner, however, as to leave
                              the words still legible; while the same thought, or
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6235"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="327" data-tei-n="314"> </a></span>
                              something like it, has been interlined in other words; and
                              even the interlineations themselves, are oftener than
                              otherwise, erased, altered, and farther interlined, for
                              the purpose of seeking to amend the expression: so
                              that, in casting one's eyes over the manuscript report
                              of Mr. Henry's speech, in order to single out the most
                              brilliant passages, those which are the most blotted and
                              blurred by erasures and interlineations, may be selected
                              at once, without the hazard of mistake. Hence it is
                              obvious, that the reporter had not, in his stenographic
                              notes, the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6237" style="font-style: italic;">very expression</hi> of the speaker; but some
                              hint merely, of the thought, which he was afterwards
                              unable to fill up to his own satisfaction. If farther
                              evidence on this subject were required, it is found in
                              this circumstance, that on reading Mr. Robertson's
                              imitations of the splendid parts of Mr. Henry's speech,
                              to several of those who heard it delivered, there has
                              not been one who has not turned off from the recital,
                              with the strongest expressions of disappointment, and in
                              several instances corrected by memory the language of
                              the reporter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6241">This explanation is equally due to the memory of Mr.
                              Henry, to the reader, and the author; for the author is
                              fully aware that if the truth of the general character
                              which he has attempted to give of Mr. Henry's eloquence,
                              shall be tested by those imperfect specimens to
                              which, for want of more accurate ones, he has been
                              compelled to resort, discredit will be thrown upon the whole
                              work, and it will be regarded, rather as romance than
                              history. But the ingenuous and candid reader will look
                              beyond those poor and wretched imitations, and my own
                              equally poor and wretched descriptions, to that proof of
                              Mr. Henry's eloquence which is furnished by its practical
                              effects. Can there be any doubt of the supreme
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6243"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="328" data-tei-n="315"> </a></span>
                              eloquence of that man who awakened and hushed, at
                              his pleasure, “the stormy wave of the multitude?” who,
                              by his powers of speech, roused the whole American
                              people, from north to south? put the revolution into
                              motion and bore it upon his shoulders, as Atlas is
                              said to do the heavens? to whose charms of persuasion,
                              not the rabble merely, but all ranks of society have
                              borne the most unanimous evidence? who moved, not
                              merely the populace, the rocks and stones of the field,
                              but “by the summit took the mountain oak, and
                              and made him stoop to the plain?”—Instead then, of
                              comparing our descriptions of Mr. Henry's eloquence,
                              with the specimens which his reporters have made of
                              it, let the reader compare that description with the
                              effects which it actually wrought, and the universal
                              testimony which is born to it, by the rapturous admiration
                              of every one who ever had the happiness to hear him;
                              and the author, so far from being afraid of the charge
                              of exaggeration, will be apprehensive only, of that of
                              presumption, in attempting a description of powers so
                              perfectly undescribable.

                              British debts. In order to render intelligible the analysis
                              which we propose to give to the reader, it will be necessary
                              to prefix to it, a statement of the case, of the pleadings,
                              and the points made in argument, by the opening counsel.

                              of the mercantile house of Farrell and Jones, brought an
                              action of debt, in the federal court at Richmond, against
                              doctor Thomas Walker, of the county of Albemarle, in
                              Virginia, on a bond which bore date before the revolutionary
                              war; to wit,on the 11th of May, 1772. To this
                              action the defendant pleaded five several pleas:
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6252"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="329" data-tei-n="316"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6254">1. The first was, the plea of payment generally, on
                              which the plaintiff took issue; but it was not tried, the
                              cause having gone off on the demurrers growing out of
                              the subsequent pleadings.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6258">2. In his second plea, the defendant relies on the act
                              of sequestration passed by the legislature of Virginia
                              during the revolutionary war, to wit, on the 20th of
                              October, 1777; by which it was enacted, that “it should
                              be lawful for any citizen of this commonwealth, owing
                              money to a subject of Great Britain, to pay the same, or
                              any part thereof, from time to time, as he should think
                              fit, into the loan office of the state; taking thereout a
                              certificate for the same in the name of the creditor, with
                              an indorsement under the hand of the commissioner of
                              the loan office, expressing the name of the payee,
                              delivering such certificate to the governor and council,
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6260" style="font-style: italic;">whose receipt should discharge him from so much of the
                                 debt
                              </hi>:”—and the defendant exhibits the governor's
                              receipt for 2151 l. 18s. which he offers in bar, to so much
                              of the plaintiff's demand.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6264">3. In his third plea, he sets out the act of forfeiture,
                              passed by the assembly on the 3d of May, 1779, whereby
                              it was, among other things, enacted, “that all the
                              property, real and personal, within the commonwealth
                              belonging at that time to any British subject should be
                              deemed to be vested in the commonwealth;” as also the
                              act of the 6th of May, 1789, whereby it was enacted,
                              “that no demand whatsoever, originally due to a subject
                              of Great Britain, should be recoverable in any court
                              in this commonwealth, although the same might be
                              transferred to a citizen of this state, or to any other person
                              capable of maintaining such action, unless the
                              assignment had been or might be made for a valuable
                              consideration 
                              <hi id="d145581e6266" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</hi> paid before the first of May,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6269"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="330" data-tei-n="317"> </a></span>
                              1777:” and the plea insists, that the debt in the declaration
                              mentioned, was personal property of a British
                              subject, forfeited to the commonwealth under the
                              first mentioned act, and a demand, whose recovery in
                              the courts of the commonwealth, was barred by the last.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6272">4. The fourth plea takes the ground, that the king
                              of Britain and his subjects were still alien enemies, and
                              that the state of war still continued, on the ground of
                              the several direct violations of the definitive treaty of
                              peace, which follow:—1. In continuing to carry off the
                              negroes in his possession, the property of American
                              citizens and refusing to deliver them, or permit the
                              owners to take them, according to the express stipulations
                              of that treaty:—2. In the forcible detention of the
                              forts Niagara and Detroit, and the adjacent territory:—
                              3. In supplying the Indians, who were at war with the
                              United States, with arms and ammunition, furnished
                              within the territories of the United States, to visit, at the
                              forts Detroit and Niagara, and at other forts and stations
                              forcibly held by the troops and armies of the
                              king, within the United States, and in purchasing from
                              the Indians, within the territories aforesaid, the plunder
                              taken by them in war, from the United States, and the
                              persons of American citizens made prisoners; which
                              several infractions, the plea contends, had abolished
                              the treaty of peace, and placed Great Britain and the
                              United States, in a state of war, and that hence, the
                              plaintiff, being an alien enemy, had no right to sue in
                              the courts of the United States.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6275">5. The fifth plea sets forth, that at the time of
                              contracting the debt in the declaration mentioned, the
                              plaintiff and the defendant were fellow-subjects of the
                              same king and government: that on the fourth of July
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6277"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="331" data-tei-n="318"> </a></span>
                              1776, the government of the British monarch in this
                              country, was dissolved, and the co-allegiance of the
                              parties severed; whereby the plea contends, that the debt
                              in the declaration mentioned was annulled.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6280">To the second plea the plaintiff replied, insisting on
                              the treaty of peace of 1783, whereby it was stipulated
                              that creditors on either side should meet with no lawful
                              impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling
                              money, of all 
                              <hi id="d145581e6282" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</hi> debts, theretofore contracted;
                              and also on the constitution of the United States of
                              1787, by which it had been expressly declared, that
                              treaties which were 
                              <hi id="d145581e6285" style="font-style: italic;">then</hi> made, or which should

                              be made, under the authority of the United States,
                              should be 
                              <hi id="d145581e6291" style="font-style: italic;">the supreme law of the land</hi>, any thing in the
                              constitution, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6294" style="font-style: italic;">or the laws of any state to the contrary
                                 notwithstanding

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6298">The defendant rejoined, that the treaty had been
                              annulled by the infractions of it on the part of Great
                              Britain, and so could not aid the cause of the plaintiff,—
                              and farther, that the debt in the declaration mentioned
                              was not 
                              <hi id="d145581e6300" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</hi> due, and owing to the plaintiff at the
                              date of the treaty, in so much as the same (or at least
                              2151

                              set forth in the second plea; and hence that it was not
                              a subsisting debt, within the terms and provisions of the
                              treaty.

                              fifth pleas of the defendant, the plaintiff demurred; and
                              the cause came on to be argued, on these demurrers,
                              at Richmond on the 24th of November 1791.

                           <p id="d145581e6319">The cause was opened with great fairness and ability,
                              by Mr. Ronald and Mr. Baker, in succession; they
                              were answered by all the counsel of the defendant; and
                              Mr. Wickham, Mr. Starke, and Mr. Baker were heard
                              in the reply.

                           <p id="d145581e6322">The opening counsel made the following points:</p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6325">First, That debts were not a subject of confiscation, in war.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6328">Secondly, That if they were, Virginia at the time of
                              passing the acts relied on by the defendant, was not a
                              sovereign and independent state; Great Britain, not
                              having at that time assented to her independence; and
                              hence, that she had not the power of legislating away
                              the debts of fellow-subjects, not represented in her
                              legislative councils—which councils were themselves, a
                              usurpation, in the eye of the law.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6332">Thirdly, That if debts were subject to confiscation,
                              and Virginia were competent to pass laws to that effect,
                              she had not done so; and Mr. Baker, particularly,
                              entered into a minute and ingenious scrutiny of the
                              language of the several acts of assembly, to prove that, so
                              far from having been forfeited, the debts were recognized
                              as existing British debts down to the year 1782.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6335">Fourthly, That if all these points were against the
                              plaintiff, the right of recovering those debts was restored
                              by the treaty of 1783, and the constitution of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6337"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="333" data-tei-n="320"> </a></span>
                              the United States, which recognized that treaty as the
                              supreme law of the land; and,
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6340">Fifthly, That the alleged infractions of the treaty on
                              the part of Great Britain, did not produce the effect of
                              abolishing the treaty; that this was a national concern,
                              with which the individual plaintiff and defendant had
                              nothing to do; that the question of infraction was one
                              to be decided by the supreme power of the nation only,
                              and one of which the court could not, with any propriety,
                              take cognizance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6343">Mr. Baker closed his opening speech on Thursday
                              evening the 24th of November, and it was publicly
                              understood that Mr. Henry was to commence his reply
                              on the next day. The legislature was then in session;
                              but when 11 o'clock, the hour for the meeting of the
                              court, arrived, the speaker found himself without a
                              house to do business. All his authority and that
                              of his sergeant at arms were unavailing to keep the
                              members in their seats; every consideration of public
                              duty yielded to the anxiety which they felt, in common
                              with the rest of their fellow-citizens, to hear this great
                              man on this truly great and extensively interesting
                              question. Accordingly, when the court was ready to
                              proceed to business, the court room of the capitol, large
                              as it is, was insufficient to contain the vast concourse
                              that was pressing to enter it. The portico, and the area
                              in which the statue of Washington stands, were filled
                              with a disappointed crowd, who nevertheless maintained
                              their stand without. In the court room itself, the judges,
                              through condescension to the public anxiety, relaxed
                              the rigour of respect which they were in the habit of
                              exacting, and permitted the vacant seats of the bench,
                              and even the windows behind it, to be occupied by the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6345"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="334" data-tei-n="321"> </a></span>
                              impatient multitude. The noise and tumult occasioned
                              by seeking a more favourable station was at length
                              hushed, and the profound silence which reigned within
                              the room gave notice to those without, that the orator
                              had risen, or was on the point of rising. Every eye in
                              front of the bar was rivetted upon him with the most
                              eager attention: and so still and deep was the silence,
                              that every one might hear the throbbing of his own
                              heart. Mr. Henry however, appeared wholly unconscious
                              that all this preparation was on his account, and
                              rose with as much simplicity and composure, as if the
                              occasion had been one of ordinary occurrence. Nothing
                              can be more plain, modest, and unaffected, than
                              his exordium:—“I stand here, may it please your honours,
                              to support according to my power, that side of
                              the question which respects the American debtor. I beg
                              leave to beseech the patience of this honourable court;
                              because the subject is very great and important, and
                              because I have not only the greatness of the subject to
                              consider, but those numerous observations which have
                              come from the opposing counsel to answer. Thus
                              therefore, the matter proper for my discussion is
                              unavoidably accumulated. Sir, there is a circumstance
                              in this case, that is more to be deplored than that which
                              I have just mentioned; and that is this:—Those animosities,
                              which the injustice of the British nation hath
                              produced, and which I had well hoped would never
                              again be the subject of discussion, are necessarily
                              brought forth. The conduct of that nation, which bore
                              so hard upon us in the late contest, becomes once more
                              the subject of investigation. I know, sir, how well it
                              becomes a liberal man and a Christian to forget and to
                              forgive. As individuals, professing a holy religion, it is
                              out bounden duty to forgive injuries done us as
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6347"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="335" data-tei-n="322"> </a></span>
                              individuals. But, when to the character of Christian you
                              add the character of patriot, you are in a different situation.
                              Our mild and holy system of religion inculcates
                              an admirable maxim of forbearance. If your enemy
                              smites one cheek, turn the other to him. But you must
                              stop there. You cannot apply this to your country.
                              As members of a social community, this maxim does
                              not apply to you. When you consider injuries done to
                              your country, your political duty tells you of vengeance.
                              Forgive as a private man, but never forgive public injuries.
                              Observations of this nature are exceedingly unpleasant,
                              but it is my duty to use them.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6350">With the same primeval simplicity, he enters upon
                              the argument; not making a formal division of the whole
                              subject, but merely announcing the single proposition
                              which he was about to maintain, for the time; thus,
                              immediately after the exordium which has been quoted, he
                              proceeds thus:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6353">“The first point which I shall endeavour to establish
                              will be, that debts, in common wars, become subject to
                              forfeiture; and if forfeited in common wars, much more
                              must they be so, in a revolution war, as the late contest
                              was. In considering this subject, it is will be necessary to
                              define what a debt is.—I mean by it an engagement, or
                              promise by one man to pay to another for a valuable
                              consideration, an adequate price. By a contract thus
                              made, for a valuable consideration, there arises what,
                              in the law phrase is called a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6355" style="font-style: italic;">lien</hi>, on the body and goods
                              of the promissor or debtor. This interest which the
                              creditor becomes entitled to, in the goods and body, of
                              his debtor, is such as may be taken from the creditor, if
                              he be found the subject of a hostile country. This
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6358"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="336" data-tei-n="323"> </a></span>
                              position is supported by the following authorities.”
                              He then cites and reads copious extracts from Grotius
                              and Vattel, which seem to support his position decisively
                              —and then proceeds thus: “This authority
                              decides in the most clear and satisfactory manner, that,
                              as a nation, we had powers as extensive and unlimited
                              as any nation on earth. This great writer, after stating
                              the equality and independence of nations, and who are,
                              and who are not enemies, does away the distinction
                              between corporeal and incorporeal rights, and declares
                              that war gives the same right 
                              <hi id="d145581e6360" style="font-style: italic;">over the debts</hi>, as over the
                              other goods of an enemy. He illustrates his doctrine
                              by the instance of Alexander's remitting to the Thessalians,
                              a debt due by them to the Theban commonwealth
                              —This is a case in point—For supposing the
                              subjects of Alexander had been indebted to the Thebans,
                              might he not have remitted the debts due by
                              them to that people, as well as the debts due them by
                              his allies, the Thessalians? Let me not be told that he
                              was entitled to the goods of the Thebans, because he
                              had conquered then. If he could remit a debt due by
                              those whose claim of friendship was so inferior, those
                              who were only attached to him by the feeble ties of
                              contingent and temporary alliance—if his Macedonians,
                              his immediate and natural subjects, were indebted to
                              the Thebans, could he not have remitted 
                              <hi id="d145581e6363" style="font-style: italic;">their</hi> debts?
                              This author states in clear, unequivocal terms, by fair
                              inference and unavoidable deduction, that when two
                              nations are at war, either nation has a right, according
                              to the laws of nature and nations, to remit to its own
                              citizens, debts which they may owe to the enemy. If
                              this point wanted further elucidation—it is pointedly
                              proved by the authority which I first quoted from Grotius,
                              that it is an inseparable concomitant of sovereign
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6366"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="337" data-tei-n="324"> </a></span>
                              power; that debts, and contracts similar to those which
                              existed in America, at the time the war with Great
                              Britain broke out, may, in virtue of the eminent domain

                                 greater right in the goods of his subjects, for the public
                                 advantage, than the proprietors themselves. And when
                                 the exigency of the state requires a supply, every man is
                                 more obliged to contribute towards it, than to satisfy his
                                 creditors
                              </hi>. The sovereign may discharge a debtor from

                              </hi>.’ What language can be more expressive than this?
                              Can the mind of man conceive any thing more
                              comprehensive? Rights are of two sorts, private or inferior—
                              or 
                              <hi id="d145581e6375" style="font-style: italic;">eminent</hi> and

                              common benefit. The latter is paramount to the former.—
                              A king or chief of a nation, has a greater right
                              than the owner himself, over any property in the nation.
                              The individual who owns private property cannot dispose
                              of it, contrary to the will of his sovereign, to injure
                              the public. This author is known to be no advocate
                              for tyranny, yet he mentions that a king has a superior
                              power over the property in his nation, and that by virtue
                              thereof, he may discharge his subjects for ever from
                              debts which they owe to an enemy.

                           <p id="d145581e6383">“The instance which our author derives from the
                              Roman history, affords a striking instance of the length
                              to which the necessities and exigencies of a nation will
                              warrant it to go. It was a juncture critical to the Roman
                              affairs. But their situation was not more critical or
                              dangerous than ours, at the time these debts were
                              confiscated. It was after the total defeat, and dreadful
                              slaughter at Cannae, when the state was in the most
                              imminent danger. Our situation in the late war was
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6385"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="338" data-tei-n="325"> </a></span>
                              equally perilous. Every consideration must give way
                              to the public safety. That admirable Roman maxim,
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6387" style="font-style: italic;">

                              </hi>, governed that people in every
                              emergency. It is a maxim that ought to govern every
                              community. It was not peculiar to the Roman people.
                              The impression came from the same source from
                              which we derive our existence. Self-preservation, that
                              great dictate implanted in us by nature, must regulate
                              our conduct; we must have a power to act according to
                              our necessities, and it remains for human judgment to
                              decide what are the proper occasions for the exercise
                              of this power. Call to your recollection our situation
                              during the late arduous contest. Was it not necessary
                              in our day of trial, to go to the last iota of human
                              right? The Romans fought for their altars and household
                              gods. By these terms they meant every thing
                              dear and valuable to men. Was not our stake as
                              important as theirs? But many other nations engage in the
                              most bloody wars, for the most trivial and frivolous
                              causes. If other nations who carried on wars for a
                              mere point of honour, or a punctilio of gallantry, were
                              warranted in the exercise of this power; were not we,
                              who fought for every thing most inestimable and valuable
                              to mankind, justified in using it? Our finances
                              were in a more distressing situation than theirs at this
                              awful period of our existence. Our war was in opposition
                              to the most grievous oppression—we resisted, and
                              our resistance was approved and blessed by heaven.
                              The most illustrious men who have considered human
                              affairs, when they have revolved human rights, and
                              considered how far a nation is warranted to act in
                              cases of emergency, declare that the only ingredient
                              essential to the rectitude and validity of its measures is,
                              that they be for the public good. I need hardly observe
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6393"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="339" data-tei-n="326"> </a></span>
                              that the confiscation of these debt was for the public
                              good. Those who decided it, were constitutionally
                              enabled to determine it. Grotius shows that you have
                              not only power over the goods of your enemies, but
                              according to the exigency of affairs, you may seize the
                              property of your citizens.” After reading the opposite
                              passage from Grotius, he says—“I read these authorities
                              to prove, that the property of an enemy is liable to
                              forfeiture, and that debts are as much the subject of
                              hostile contest as tangible property. And Vattel, p.
                              484, as before mentioned, pointedly enumerates 
                              <hi id="d145581e6395" style="font-style: italic;">rights</hi>
                              and 
                              <hi id="d145581e6398" style="font-style: italic;">debts</hi> among such property of the enemy, as is
                              liable to confiscation. To this last author, I must
                              frequently resort in the course of my argument. I
                              put great confidence in him, from the weight of his
                              authority,—for he is universally respected by all the
                              wise and enlightened of mankind, being no less celebrated
                              for his great judgment and knowledge, than for
                              his universal philanthrophy. One of his first principles
                              of the law of nations, is a perfect equality of rights
                              among nations: that each nation ought to be left in the
                              peaceable enjoyment of that liberty it has derived from
                              nature. I refer your honours to his preliminary discourse
                              from 6th to the 12th page, and as it will greatly
                              elucidate the subject, and tend to prove the position I
                              have attempted to support, I will read section 17, 18,
                              19, and 20 of this discourse.” Having read these
                              sections, he touches transiently, but powerfully,
                              the objection to the want of national independence
                              to pass the laws of forfeiture, till that independence
                              was assented to by the king of Great Britain.
                              “When the war commenced,” said he, “these things,
                              called British debts, lost their quality of external
                              obligation, and became matters of internal obligation,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6402"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="340" data-tei-n="327"> </a></span>
                              because the creditors had no right of constraint over
                              the debtors. They were before the war, matters of
                              perfect external obligation, accompanied by a right of
                              constraint; but the war having taken away this right of
                              constraint over the debtors, they were changed into an
                              internal obligation, binding the conscience only. For
                              it will not surely be denied, that the creditor lost the
                              right of constraint over his debtor. From the authority
                              of this respectable author, therefore—from the clearest
                              principles of the laws of nature and nations, these debts
                              became subject to forfeiture or remission. Those
                              authors state, in language as emphatic and nervous as
                              the human mind can conceive, or the human tongue
                              can utter, that independent nations have the power of
                              confiscating the property of their enemies: and so had
                              this gallant nation. America, being a sovereign and
                              complete nation, in all its forms and departments,
                              possessed all the rights of the most powerful and ancient
                              nations. Respecting the power of legislation, it was a
                              nation complete, and without human control. Respecting
                              public justice, it was a nation blessed by heaven,
                              with the experience of past times; not like those nations,
                              whose crude systems of jurisprudence originated
                              in the ages of barbarity and ignorance of human rights.
                              America was a sovereign nation, when her sons stepped
                              forth, to resist the unjust hand of oppression, and declared
                              themselves independent. The consent of Great
                              Britain was not necessary, (as the gentlemen on the
                              other side urge,) to create us a nation. Yes, sir, we
                              were a nation, long before the monarch of that little
                              island in the Atlantic ocean, gave his 
                              <hi id="d145581e6404" style="font-style: italic;">puny</hi> assent to it.
                              (These words he accompanied by a most significant
                              gesture—rising on tiptoe—pointing as to a vast distance,
                              and half closing his eye-lids, as if endeavouring, with
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6407"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="341" data-tei-n="328"> </a></span>
                              extreme difficulty, to draw a sight on some object
                              almost too small for vision—and blowing out the words,
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6409" style="font-style: italic;">puny</hi> assent, with his lips curled with unutterable contempt.)
                              America was long before that time a great and
                              gallant nation. In the estimation of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6412" style="font-style: italic;">other nations</hi>, we
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6415" style="font-style: italic;">were</hi> so: the beneficent hand of Heaven enabled her to
                              triumph, and secured to her the most sacred rights
                              mortals can enjoy. When these illustrious authors,
                              these friends to human nature, these kind instructors of
                              human errors and frailties,<a href="note86" class="ref-external" n="86" rend="sc"> *</a> contemplate the obligations
                              and corresponding rights of nations, and define the
                              internal right, which is without constraint and not binding,
                              do they not understand such rights as these, which
                              the British creditors now claim? Here this man tells
                              us what conscience says ought to be done, and what is
                              compulsory. These British debts must come within
                              the grasp of human power, like all other human things.
                              They ceased to have that external quality, and fell into
                              that mass of power, which belonged to our legislature
                              by the law of nations.”

                              required both address and vigour to remove. Vattel,

                              in the fullest latitude, yet the customary law of Europe
                              is against the exercise of this power of confiscation of
                              debts; in support of which position, they rely on what
                              is added by Vattel, p. 484. Let us examine what he
                              says:—‘The sovereign has naturally the same right
                              over what his subjects may be indebted to enemies:
                              therefore he may confiscate debts of this nature, if the
                              term of payment happen in the time of war, or at least
                              he may prohibit his subjects from paying while the war
                              lasts. 
                              <hi id="d145581e6433" style="font-style: italic;">But at present, in regard to the advantage and
                                 safety of commerce, all the sovereigns of Europe have
                                 departed from this rigour. And as this custom has
                                 generally been received, he who should act contrary to it,
                                 would injure the public faith; for strangers trusted his
                                 subjects only, from a firm persuasion
                              </hi>, that the general
                              custom would be observed.’ Excellent man! and excellent
                              sentiments! The principle cannot be denied to be
                              good; but when you apply it to the case before the court,
                              does it warrant their conclusions? The author says,
                              that although a nation has a right to confiscate debts
                              due by its people to an enemy, yet, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6436" style="font-style: italic;">at present, the custom
                                 of Europe is contrary
                              </hi>. It is not enough for this
                              author to tell us that this 
                              <hi id="d145581e6439" style="font-style: italic;">custom</hi> is contrary to the

                              <hi id="d145581e6446" style="font-style: italic;">right</hi>. Let us see whether this
                              custom has existence here. Vattel, having spoken of
                              the necessary law of nations, which is immutable, and
                              the obligations whereof are indispensable, proceeds to
                              distinguish the several other kinds of natural law in the

                              to its effects, as in relation to the matter itself:
                              and in this last respect, these rules will serve to distinguish
                              the lawful and innocent customs, from those that
                              are unjust and illegal!

                              was there a customary law of

                              customary law of nations did not apply in their favour.
                              Were these debts contracted 
                              <hi id="d145581e6573" style="font-style: italic;">from a persuasion of its
                                 observance? Did the creditors trust to this customary
                                 law of nations
                              </hi>? No, sir. They trusted to what they
                              thought as firm, the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6576" style="font-style: italic;">statute</hi> and 
                              <hi id="d145581e6579" style="font-style: italic;">common law of
                                 England
                              </hi>.—Victorious and successful as their nation
                              had lately been, when they, in their pride and
                              inconsiderate self-confidence, stretched out the hand
                              of oppression, their subjects placed no reliance on
                              the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6583" style="font-style: italic;">customs of particular nations</hi>. They put confidence
                              in those barriers of right, which were derived from their
                              own nation. Their reliance was, that the tribunals established
                              in this country, under the same royal authority
                              as in England, would do them justice. If we were not
                              willing, they possessed the power of compelling us to
                              do them justice. The debts having therefore, not
                              been contracted 
                              <hi id="d145581e6586" style="font-style: italic;">from any reliance on the customary
                                 law of nations
                              </hi>, were they contracted 
                              <hi id="d145581e6589" style="font-style: italic;">from a regard ‘to
                                 the rights of commerce
                              </hi>?’ From a view of promoting
                              the commerce of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6592" style="font-style: italic;">those little things called colonies</hi>? This
                              regard could not have been the ground they were
                              contracted on, for their 
                              <hi id="d145581e6595" style="font-style: italic;">conduct</hi> evinced that 
                              <hi id="d145581e6598" style="font-style: italic;">they wished
                                 to take the right of commerce from us
                              </hi>. What other
                              ingredient remains to show the operation of this custom
                              in their favour? The book speaks of strangers trusting
                              subjects of a different nation, from a reliance on the
                              observance of the customary law. The fact here was,
                              that fellow-subjects trusted us, on the footing just
                              stated; trusting to the existing compulsory process of
                              law, not relying on a passive inert custom. A fearful,
                              plodding, sagacious trader, would not rely on so
                              flimsy, so uncertain a dependence. Something similar
                              to what he thought positive satisfaction, he relied on.
                              Were we not subject to the same king? The cases are
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6602"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="346" data-tei-n="333"> </a></span>
                              then at variance. He states the custom to exist for
                              the advantage of commerce, and that a departure from
                              it would injure the public faith. Public faith is in this
                              case out of the question. The public faith was not
                              pledged—it could not therefore be injured. I have
                              already read to your honours from the 11th page of
                              the preliminary discourse of Vattel, ‘
                              <hi id="d145581e6604" style="font-style: italic;">that the customary
                                 law of nations is only binding on those who have
                                 adopted it, and that it is not universal, any more
                                 than conventional laws
                              </hi>.’ It is evident we could not
                              be bound by any convention or treaty to which we
                              ourselves were not a party: and from this authority it is
                              equally obvious, that we could not be bound by any
                              customary law to which we were not parties. I think
                              therefore, with great submission to the court, that the
                              right for which I contended, that is, that in common wars
                              between independent nations, either of the contending
                              parties has a right to confiscate or remit debts due by
                              its people to the enemy, is not shaken by the customary
                              law of nations, as far as it regards us, because the custom
                              could not affect us. But gentlemen say we were
                              not completely independent till the year 1783! To take
                              them on their own ground, their arguments will fail
                              them. There is a customary law which will operate
                              pretty strongly on our side of the question. What
                              were the inducements of the debtor? On what did the
                              American debtor rely? Sir, he relied for protection,
                              on that system of common and statute law on which
                              the creditors depended. Was he deceived in that reliance?
                              That he was most miserably deceived, I believe
                              will not admit of a doubt. The customary law of nations
                              will only apply to distinct nations, mutually consenting
                              thereto. When tyranny attempted to rivet her
                              chains upon us, and we boldly broke them asunder, we
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6607"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="347" data-tei-n="334"> </a></span>
                              were remitted to that amplitude of freedom which the
                              beneficent hand of nature gave us. We were not
                              bound by fetters which are of benefit to one party,
                              while they are destructive to the other. Should it be
                              proper that we should be bound, and they unrestrained?”
                              As a still farther answer to the objection,
                              and as giving the only rule of restraint in operating on
                              the property of a belligerent, he cites the following
                              principle from Vattel, and applies it to the actual state
                              of America. “Vattel, book the 3d, ch. 8, sect. 137,
                              says, that the lawful end gives a true right only to those
                              means 
                              <hi id="d145581e6609" style="font-style: italic;">which are necessary for obtaining such end</hi>.
                              Whatever exceeds this, is censured by the laws of nature
                              as faulty, and will be condemned at the tribunal
                              of conscience. Hence it is, that the right to such or
                              such acts of hostility, varies according to their circumstances.
                              What is just and perfectly innocent in a war,
                              in one particular situation, is not always so in another.
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6612" style="font-style: italic;">Right goes hand in hand with necessity</hi>, and the exigency
                              of the case; but never exceeds it.” “This sir, is
                              the first dictate of nature, and the practice of nations;
                              and if your misfortunes and distresses should be sad
                              and dreadful, you are let loose from those common
                              restraints which may be proper on common occasions,
                              in order to preserve the great rights of human nature.
                              This is laid down by that great writer, in clear and
                              unequivocal terms. If then, sir, it be certain from a
                              recurrence to facts, that it was necessary for America
                              to seize on British property, this book warrants the
                              legislature of this state, in passing those confiscating and
                              prohibitory laws. I need only refer to your recollection,
                              for our pressing situation during the late contest;
                              and happy am I, that this all important question comes
                              on, before the heads of those who were actors in the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6615"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="348" data-tei-n="335"> </a></span>
                              great scene, are laid in the dust. An uninformed
                              posterity would be unacquainted with the awful necessity,
                              which impelled us on. If the means were within reach—
                              we were warranted by the laws of nature and nations, to
                              use them. The fact was that we were attacked by one
                              of the most formidable nations under heaven; a nation
                              that carried terror and dread with its thunder to both
                              hemispheres.” (This illustration of the power of Great
                              Britain was, if we may trust respectable tradition, much
                              more expanded than we find it in the report; and such
                              was the force of his imagination, and the irresistible
                              energy of his delivery and action, that the audience
                              now felt themselves instinctively recoiling from the
                              tremendous power of that very nation, which but a
                              short time before had been exhibited as a mere
                              dot in the Atlantic, a point so microscopic as to be
                              scarcely visible to the naked eye: he proceeds to
                              close the first member of his first point, thus:) “Our
                              united property enabled us to look in the face
                              that mighty people. Dared we to have gone in opposition
                              to them, bound hand and foot? Would we have
                              dared to resist them, fettered? for we should have been
                              fettered, if we had been deprived of so considerable a
                              part of our little stock of national resources. In that
                              most critical and dangerous emergency, our all was but
                              a little thing. Had we a treasury—an exchequer? Had
                              we commerce? Had we any revenue? Had we any
                              thing from which a nation could drawwealth? No, sir.
                              Our credit became the scorn of our foes. However
                              the efforts of certain patriotic characters, (there were
                              not a few of them, thank heaven,) gave us credit among
                              our own people. But we had not a farthing to spare:
                              We were obliged to go on a most grievous anticipation,
                              the weight of which we feel at this day. Recur to our
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6618"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="349" data-tei-n="336"> </a></span>
                              actual situation, and the means we had of defending
                              ourselves. The actual situation of America is described
                              here, where this author says, ‘
                              <hi id="d145581e6620" style="font-style: italic;">that right goes hand in
                                 hand with necessity
                              </hi>.’ The necessity being great and
                              dreadful, you are warranted to lay hold of every atom
                              of money within your reach, especially if it be the
                              money of your enemies. It is prudent and necessary
                              to strengthen yourselves and weaken your enemies.
                              Vattel, book 3d, ch. 8, sect. 138, says, ‘the business of
                              a just war being, to suppress violence and injustice, it
                              gives a right to compel by force, him who is deaf to the
                              voice of justice. It gives a right of doing against the
                              enemy, whatever is necessary for weakening him—for
                              disabling him from making any farther resistance in
                              support of his injustice—and the most effectual, the
                              most proper methods may be chosen, provided they have
                              nothing odious, be not unlawful in themselves, or
                              exploded by the law of nature.’ Here let me pause for
                              a moment, and ask, whether it be odious in itself, or
                              exploded by the law of nature, to seize those debts?
                              No—because the money was taken from the very
                              offenders. We fought for the great, unalienable,
                              hereditary rights of human nature. An unwarrantable
                              attack was made upon us. An attack, not only not
                              congenial with motherly or parental tenderness, but
                              incompatible with the principles of humanity or civilization.
                              Our defence then was a necessary one. What
                              says Vattel, book 3d, ch. 8, sect. 136? ‘The end of a
                              just war is to 
                              <hi id="d145581e6623" style="font-style: italic;">revenge or prevent injury</hi>; that is, to procure
                              by force the justice which cannot otherwise be
                              obtained; to compel an unjust person to repair an injury
                              already done, or to give securities against any wrong
                              threatened by him. On a declaration of war, therefore,
                              this nation has a right of doing against the enemy whatever
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6626"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="350" data-tei-n="337"> </a></span>
                              is necessary to this justifiable end of bringing him
                              to reason, and obtaining justice and security from him.’
                              We have taken nothing in this necessary defence, but
                              from the very offenders—those who unjustly attacked
                              us:—for we had a right of considering every individual
                              of the British nation as an enemy. This I prove by
                              the same great writer, p. 519, sect. 139, of the same
                              book. An enemy attacking me unjustly, gives me an
                              undoubted right of repelling his violences; and he who
                              opposes me in arms, when I demand only my right,
                              becomes himself the real aggressor, by his unjust
                              resistance. He is the first author of the violence, and
                              obliges me to make use of force, for securing myself
                              against the wrongs intended me, either in my person or
                              possessions; for if the effects of this force proceed so
                              far as to take away his life, he owes the misfortune to
                              himself; for if, by sparing him, I should submit to the
                              injury, the good would soon become the prey of the
                              wicked. Hence the right of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6628" style="font-style: italic;">killing</hi> enemies in a just
                              war is derived; when their resistance cannot be
                              suppressed—when they are not to be reduced by milder
                              methods, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6631" style="font-style: italic;">there is a right of taking away their life</hi>. Under
                              the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6635" style="font-style: italic;">name of enemies</hi>, as we have already shown
                              are comprehended not only the first author of the war,
                              but likewise 
                              <hi id="d145581e6638" style="font-style: italic;">all who join him, and fight for his cause</hi>.’
                              Thus I think the first part of my position confirmed and
                              unshaken; that in common wars, a nation not restrained
                              by the customary law of nations, has a right to confiscate
                              debts.” In the second member of that point, he is
                              released from the servility of quotation; and, to borrow
                              a phrase of his own, “remitted to the amplitude” of his
                              natural genius: the reader will therefore be amused by
                              a more copious extract. “From this I will go on to the
                              other branch of my position. That if, in common wars,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6641"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="351" data-tei-n="338"> </a></span>
                              debts be liable to forfeiture, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6643" style="font-style: italic;">
                                 
                                 <foreign id="d145581e6645" xml:lang="lat">a fortiori</foreign>
                                 
                              </hi>, must they be so, in
                              a revolution war? Let me contrast the late war with wars
                              in common. According to those people called kings, wars
                              in common are systematic and produced for trifles; for
                              not conforming to imaginary honours; because you have
                              not lowered your flag before him at sea; or for a supposed
                              affront to the person of an ambassador. Nations
                              are set by the ears, and the most horrid devastations are
                              brought on mankind, for the most frivolous causes. If
                              then, when small matters are in contest, debts be forfeitable,
                              what must have accrued to us, as engaged in
                              the late revolution war—a war commenced in attainder,
                              perfidy and confiscation? If we take with us this great
                              principle of Vattel, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6649" style="font-style: italic;">that right goes in hand with necessity</hi>,
                              and consider the peculiar situation of the American
                              people, we will find reason more than sufficient, to give
                              us a right of confiscating those debts. The most striking
                              peculiarity attended the American war. In the
                              first of it, we were stripped of every municipal right.
                              Rights and obligations are correspondent, co-extensive
                              and inseparable—they must exist together, or not at all
                              —we were therefore, when stripped of all our municipal
                              rights, clear of every municipal obligation, burden and
                              onerous engagement. If then the obligation be gone,
                              what is become of the correspondent right? They are
                              mutually gone.” (These little words, “they are mutually
                              gone,” which would have made no figure in the
                              pronunciation of an ordinary speaker, are said to have
                              formed a beautiful picture, as delivered by Mr. Henry:
                              his eyes seemed to have pursued these associated objects
                              to the extremest verge of mortal sight, while the fall of
                              his voice, and correspondent fall of his extended hand,
                              with the palm downwards, depicted the idea of
                              evanescence, with indescribable force: the audience
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6652"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="352" data-tei-n="339"> </a></span>
                              might imagine that they saw the objects at the very
                              instant when they vanished in the distance, and became
                              commingled with the air: and all this too, without any
                              affected pause to give it effect; without any apparent
                              effort on his part; but with all the quickness of thought
                              and all the ease of nature.) “The case of sovereign
                              and independent nations at war, is far different; because
                              there, private right is respected, and domestic 
                              <hi id="d145581e6655" style="font-style: italic;">asylum</hi>
                              held sacred.—Was it the case in our war? No, sir.—
                              Daggers were planted in your chambers, and mischief,
                              death and destruction, might meet you at your fireside.
                              There is an essential variance between the late war
                              and common wars. In common wars, children are
                              not obliged to fight against their fathers, nor brothers
                              against brothers, nor kindred against kindred. Our
                              men were compelled, contrary to the most sacred ties
                              of humanity, to shed the blood of their dearest connections.
                              In common wars, contending parties respect
                              municipal rights, and leave, even to those they invade,
                              the means of paying debts, and complying with obligations:
                              they touch not private property. For example,
                              when a British army lands in France, they plunder
                              nothing: they pay for what they have, and respect the
                              tribunals of justice, unless they have a mind to be called
                              a savage nation.—Were we thus treated? Were we
                              permitted to exercise industry and to collect debts, by
                              which we might be enabled to pay British creditors?
                              Had we a power to pursue commerce? No, sir.—What
                              became of our agriculture? Our inhabitants were
                              mercilessly and brutally plundered, and our enemies
                              professed to maintain their army by those means only.
                              Our slaves carried away, our crops burnt, a cruel war
                              carried on against our agriculture—disability to pay
                              debts produced by pillage and devastation, contrary to
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6658"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="353" data-tei-n="340"> </a></span>
                              every principle of national law. From that series of
                              plenty in which we had been accustomed to live and to
                              revel, we were plunged into every species of human
                              calamity. Our lives attacked—charge of rebels fixed
                              upon us—confiscations and attainder denounced against
                              the whole continent: and he that was called king of
                              England sat judge upon our case—he pronounced his
                              judgment, not like those to whom poetic fancy has given
                              existence—not like him who sits in the infernal regions,
                              and dooms to the Stygian lake those spirits who deserve
                              it, because 
                              <hi id="d145581e6660" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> spares the innocent, and sends 
                              <hi id="d145581e6663" style="font-style: italic;">some</hi> to the
                              fields of Elysium—not like 
                              <hi id="d145581e6666" style="font-style: italic;">him</hi> who sat in ancient
                              imperial Rome, and wished the people had but one
                              neck, that he might at one blow strike off their heads,
                              and spare himself the trouble of carnage and massacre,
                              because 
                              <hi id="d145581e6669" style="font-style: italic;">one city</hi> would have satisfied his vengeance—
                              not like any of his fellow-men, for nothing would satiate
                              his sanguinary ferocity, but the indiscriminate destruction
                              of a whole continent—involving the innocent with
                              the guilty. Yes, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6673" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> sat in judgment with his coadjutors,
                              and pronounced proscription, attainder, and forfeiture,
                              against men, women, and even children at the breast.
                              Is not this description pointedly true, in all its parts?
                              And 
                              <hi id="d145581e6676" style="font-style: italic;">who</hi> were his coadjutors and executioners in this
                              strange court of judicature? Like the fiends of poetic
                              imagination—
                              <hi id="d145581e6679" style="font-style: italic;">Hessians, Indians</hi>, and 
                              <hi id="d145581e6682" style="font-style: italic;">Negroes</hi>, were
                              his coadjutors and executioners. Is there any thing in
                              this sad detail of offences, which is unfounded? Any
                              thing not enforced by the act of parliament against
                              America? We were thereby driven out of their protection,
                              and branded by the epithet 
                              <hi id="d145581e6685" style="font-style: italic;">rebels</hi>. The term
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6688" style="font-style: italic;">rebel</hi> may not now appear in all its train of horrid
                              consequences. We know that when a person is called
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6692" style="font-style: italic;">rebel</hi> by that government, his goods and life are forfeited,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6695"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="354" data-tei-n="341"> </a></span>
                              and his very blood pronounced to be corrupted, and
                              the severity of the punishment entailed on his posterity.
                              To whom may we apply for the verity of this?
                              The jurisprudence and history of that nation, prove, that
                              when they speak of rebels, nothing but blood will satisfy
                              them. Is there nothing hideous in this part of the portrait?
                              —It is unparalleled in the annals of mankind.
                              Though I have respect for individuals of that nation, my
                              duty constrains me to speak thus. When we contemplate
                              this mode of warfare, and the sentiments of the writers
                              on natural law on this subject, we are justified in saying,
                              that in this revolution war, we had a right to consider
                              British debts as subject to confiscation—and to
                              seize the property of those who originated that war. As
                              to the injuries done to agriculture, they appear in a
                              diminutive view, when compared to the injuries and
                              indignities offered to persons, and mansions of abode.
                              Sir, from your seat, you might have seen instances of
                              the most grievous hostility, not only private property
                              wantonly pillaged, but men, women, and children,
                              dragged publicly from their habitations, and indiscriminately
                              devoted to destruction. The rights of humanity
                              were sacrificed. We were then deprived not only of
                              the benefits of municipal, but natural law. If there
                              shall grow out of these considerations a palpable disability
                              to pay those debts, I ask, if the claim be just?
                              For that disability was produced by those excesses—by
                              those very men who come on us now for payment. Here
                              give me leave to say, that they sold us a bad title in
                              whatever they sold us—in real as well as in personal
                              property. Describe the nature of a debt: it is an
                              engagement or promise to pay—but it must be for a
                              valuable consideration. If this be clear, was not the title
                              to whatever property they sold us, bad in every sense
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6697"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="355" data-tei-n="342"> </a></span>
                              of the word, when the war followed? What can add
                              value to property? Force. Notwithstanding the equity
                              and fairness of the debt when incurred, if the security
                              of the property received was afterwards destroyed, the
                              title has proved defective. Suppose millions were
                              contracted for and received, those millions give you no
                              advantage, without force to protect them. This necessary
                              protection is withdrawn by the very men who
                              were bound to afford it, and who now demand payment.
                              Neither lands, slaves, nor other property, are
                              worth a shilling, without protecting force. This title
                              was destroyed, when the act of parliament putting us
                              out of their protection, passed against America. I say,
                              sir, the title was destroyed by the very offenders who
                              come here now and demand payment. Justice and
                              equity cancel the obligation, as to the price that was to
                              be given for it, because the tenure is destroyed, and
                              the effects purchased have no value. Such a claim is
                              unsupported by the plainest notions of right and wrong.
                              For this long catalogue of offences committed against
                              the citizens of America, every individual of the British
                              nation is accountable. How are you to be compensated
                              for those depredations on persons and property? Are
                              you to go to the kingdom of England, to find the very
                              individual who did you the outrage, and demand satisfaction
                              of him? To tell you of such a remedy as this, is adding
                              insult to injury. Every individual is chargeable with
                              national offences.” To maintain this last position, he cites
                              an authority expressly in point, from Vattel, and proceeds
                              thus: “These observations of Vattel amount to
                              this: that a king or conductor of a nation is considered
                              as a moral person, by means of whom the nation
                              acquires or loses its rights, and subjects itself to penalties.
                              The individuals, and the nation which they compose,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6699"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="356" data-tei-n="343"> </a></span>
                              are one. I will therefore take it for granted, that
                              whatever violences and excesses were committed on
                              this continent, are chargeable to the plaintiff in this
                              very action. Recollect our distressed situation. We
                              had no exchequer, no finances, no army, no navy, no
                              common means of defence. Our necessity—dire
                              necessity compelled us to throw aside those rules which
                              respect private property, and to make impresses on our
                              own citizens to support the war. Right and necessity
                              being co-extensive, we were compelled to exert a right
                              the most eminent over the whole community. The
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6701" style="font-style: italic;">
                                 
                                 <foreign id="d145581e6703" xml:lang="lat">salus populi</foreign>
                                 
                              </hi> demanded what we did. If we had a
                              right to disregard the legal fences thrown round the
                              property of our citizens, had we not a greater right to
                              take British property? Another peculiarity contributes
                              to aid our defence. The want of an exchequer obliged
                              us to emit paper money, and compel our citizens to
                              receive it for gold. In the ears of some men this
                              sounds harshly. But they are young men, who do not
                              know and feel the irresistible necessity that urged us.
                              Would your armies have been raised, clothed, maintained,
                              or kept together without paper money? Without
                              it, the war would have stood still, resistance to
                              tyranny should have stopped, and despotism with all
                              its horrid train of appurtenances, must have depressed
                              your country. We compelled the people to receive it
                              in payment of all debts—we induced and invited them
                              (if we did not compel them) to put it into the treasury,
                              as a complete discharge from their debts. Sir, I trust
                              I shall not live to see the day, when the public councils
                              of America will give ground to say that this was a state-trick,
                              contrived to delude and defraud the citizens.
                              What must it be ostensibly, when by the compact of
                              your nation, they had publickly bound and pledged
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6707"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="357" data-tei-n="344"> </a></span>
                              themselves, that it was and should be money, if afterwards,
                              in the course of human events, when temptations
                              present themselves, they shall declare that it is
                              not money? Sir, the honest planter is unskilled in
                              political tricks and deceptions. His interest ought never
                              to be sacrificed. The law is his guide. The law compelled
                              him to receive it, and his countrymen would have
                              branded him with the name of enemy, if he had
                              refused it. The laws of the country are as sacred as the
                              imaginary sanctity of British debts. Sir, national
                              engagements ought to be held sacred; the public violation
                              of this solemn engagement will destroy all confidence
                              in the government. If you depart from the national
                              compact one iota, you give a dangerous precedent,
                              which may imperceptibly and gradually introduce the
                              most destructive encroachment on human rights.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6711">He then proceeds to notice more directly the objection
                              that we were not a people competent for legislation,
                              till the assent of the British king was given to our
                              independence: “I will beg leave here to dissent from the
                              position of the gentleman on the other side, which denied
                              that we were a people, till our enemies were pleased
                              to say we were so. That we were a people, and had a
                              right to do every thing which a great and a royal—nay
                              an imperial people could do, is clear and indisputable.
                              Though under the humble appearance of republicanism,
                              our government and national existence, when
                              examined, are as solid as a rock—not resting on the
                              mere fraud and oppression of rulers, nor the credulity,
                              nor barbarous ignorance of the people; but founded on
                              the consent and conviction of enlightened human nature.
                              That we had every right, that completely independent
                              nations can have, will be satisfactorily proved
                              to your honours, by again referring to Vattel.” He
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6713"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="358" data-tei-n="345"> </a></span>
                              then cites and reads a passage from Vattel, the effect of
                              which is, that during a civil war, the parties acknowledging
                              no common judge on earth, are to be considered
                              as two distinct people; and to govern themselves in the
                              conduct of the war by the general laws of nations.
                              After which he proceeds thus:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6716">“Here then, sir, is proof abundant, that before the
                              acknowledgment of American independence by 
                              <hi id="d145581e6718" style="font-style: italic;">Great
                                 Britain
                              </hi>, we had a right to be considered as a nation;
                              because, on earth, we had no common superior; to give
                              a decision of the dispute between us and our sovereign.
                              After declaring ourselves a sovereign people, we had
                              every right a nation can claim as an independent community.
                              But the gentlemen on the other side, greatly
                              rely upon this principle, that a contract cannot be
                              dissolved without the consent of all the contracting parties:
                              the inference is, that the consent of the king of Great
                              Britain was necessary to the dissolution of the government.
                              Tyranny has too often, and too successfully
                              rivetted its chains, to warrant a belief, that a tyrant
                              will ever voluntarily, release his subjects from the
                              governmental compact. Rather might it be expected,
                              that the last iota of human misery would be borne, and
                              the oppression would descend from father to son, to the
                              latest period of earthly existence. The despotism of
                              our sovereign, ought to be considered as an implied
                              consent, on his part, to dissolve the compact between
                              us; and he and his subjects must be considered as one
                              —there can be no distinction. For, in any other view,
                              his consent could not have been obtained, without force.
                              There is such a thing, indeed, as tyranny from free
                              choice. Sweden not long ago, surrendered its liberties
                              in one day, as Denmark had done formerly; so that this
                              branch of the human family is cut off from every possible
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6721"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="359" data-tei-n="346"> </a></span>
                              enjoyment of human rights. But the right to resist
                              oppression, is not denied. The gentlemen's doctrine
                              cannot therefore apply to national communities. If any
                              additional force was wanting to confirm what I advance,
                              it would be derived from the treaty of peace, which
                              further proves, that we were entitled to all the privileges
                              of independent nations. The consent of all the people
                              of Europe said we were free. Our former master withheld
                              his consent till a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6723" style="font-style: italic;">few unlucky events</hi> compelled him.
                              And when he gave his 
                              <hi id="d145581e6726" style="font-style: italic;">fiat</hi>, it gave us, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6729" style="font-style: italic;">by relation back
                                 to the time of this declaration of independence
                              </hi>, all the
                              rights and privileges of a completely sovereign nation:
                              our independence was acknowledged by him, previous
                              to the completion of the treaty of peace. It was not a
                              condition of the treaty, but was acknowledged by his
                              own overture, preparatory to it. View the consequences
                              of their fatal doctrine. There would not only have been
                              long arrears of debts to pay, but a long catalogue of
                              crimes to be punished. If the ultimate acknowledgment
                              of our independence by Great Britain, had not
                              relation back to the time of the declaration of independence,
                              all the intermediate acts of legislation would be
                              void—and every decision and act, consequent thereon,
                              would be null. But, sir, we were a complete nation on
                              every principle, according to the authorities I have
                              already read; in addition to which I will refer your honours
                              to Vattel, book iv. ch. vii. sect. 88, to show we were
                              entitled to the benefits of national law, and to use
                              all the resources of the community: ‘From the equality
                              of all nations really sovereign and independent, it is a
                              principle of the voluntary law of nations, that no nation
                              can controul another in its internal municipal legislation.’
                              If we consider the business of confiscation
                              according to the immemorial usages of Great Britain,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6733"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="360" data-tei-n="347"> </a></span>
                              we will find, that the law and practise of that country
                              support my position. In the wars which respect revolutions
                              which have taken place in that island—life, fortune,
                              goods, debts, and everything else were confiscated.
                              The 
                              <hi id="d145581e6735" style="font-style: italic;">

                              </hi>, as it is called, involved
                              every thing. Every possible punishment has been
                              inflicted on suffering humanity that it could endure, by
                              the party which had the superiority in those wars, over
                              the defeated party, which was charged with rebellion.
                              What would have been the consequences, sir, if we had
                              been conquered? Were we not fighting against that
                              majesty? Would the justice of our opposition have
                              been considered? The most horrid forfeitures, confiscations,
                              and attainders, would have been pronounced
                              against us. Consider their history, from the time of
                              William the first, till this day. Were not his 
                              <hi id="d145581e6741" style="font-style: italic;">Normans</hi>
                              gratified with the confiscation of the richest estates in
                              England? Read the excessive cruelties, attainders,
                              and confiscations, of that reign. England depopulated
                              —its inhabitants stripped of the dearest privileges
                              of humanity—degraded with the most ignominious
                              badges of bondage and totally deprived of
                              the power of resistance to usurpation and tyranny.
                              This inability continued to the time of Henry the eighth.
                              In his reign, the business of confiscation and attainder
                              made considerable havoc. After his reign, some stop
                              was put to that effusion of blood which preceded and
                              happened under it. Recollect the sad and lamentable
                              effects of the York and Lancastrian wars. Remember
                              the rancorous hatred and inveterate detestations of
                              contending factions—the distinction of the white and red
                              roses. To come a little lower—what happened in that
                              island in the rebellions of 1715 and 1745? If we had
                              been conquered, would not our men have shared the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6744"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="361" data-tei-n="348"> </a></span>
                              fate of the people of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6746" style="font-style: italic;">Ireland</hi>? A great part of that
                              island was confiscated, though the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6749" style="font-style: italic;">Irish</hi> people thought
                              themselves engaged in a laudable cause. What confiscation
                              and punishments were inflicted in Scotland?
                              The plains of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6753" style="font-style: italic;">Culloden</hi>, and the neighbouring gibbets,
                              would show you. I thank Heaven, that the spirit of
                              liberty, under the protection of the Almighty, saved us
                              from experiencing so hard a destiny. But had we been
                              subdued, would not every right have been wrested from
                              us? What fight would have been saved? Would
                              debts have been saved? Would it not be absurd to
                              save debts, while they should burn, hang, and destroy?
                              Before we can decide with precision, we are to consider
                              the dangers we should have been exposed to, had
                              we been subdued. After presenting to your view this
                              true picture of what would have been our situation, had
                              we been subjugated—surely a correspondent right will
                              be found, growing out of the law of nations, in our
                              favour. Had our subjugation been effected, and we
                              pleaded for pardon—represented that we defended the
                              most valuable rights of human nature, and thought they
                              were strong—would our petition have availed? I feel
                              myself impelled from what has past, to ask this question.
                              I would not wish to have lived to see the sad
                              scenes we should have experienced. Needy avarice
                              and savage cruelty would have had full scope. Hungry
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6756" style="font-style: italic;">Germans</hi>, blood-thirsty 
                              <hi id="d145581e6759" style="font-style: italic;">Indians</hi>, and nations of another
                              colour, would have been let loose upon us. The sad
                              effects of such warfare have had their full influence on
                              a number of our fellow-citizens. Sir, if you had seen
                              the sad scenes which I have known; if you had seen the
                              simple but tranquil felicity of helpless and unoffending
                              women and children, in little log huts on the frontiers,
                              disturbed and destroyed by the sad effects of British
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6762"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="362" data-tei-n="349"> </a></span>
                              warfare and Indian butchery, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6764" style="font-style: italic;">your soul would have
                                 been struck with horror
                              </hi>! Even those helpless women
                              and children were the objects of the most shocking
                              barbarity. Give me leave again to recur to Vattel, p.
                              9. ‘Nations, being free, independent, and equal, and
                              having a right to judge according to the dictates of
                              conscience, of what is to be done in order to fulfil its
                              duties; the effect of all this is, the producing, at least
                              externally and among men, a perfect equality of rights
                              between nations, in the administration of their affairs,
                              and the pursuit of their pretensions, without regard to
                              the intrinsic justice of their conduct, of which others
                              have no right to form a definitive judgment: so that
                              what is permitted in one, is also permitted in the other;
                              and they ought to be considered in human society as
                              having an equal right.’ If it be allowed to the British
                              nation to put to death, to forfeit and confiscate debts
                              and every thing else, may we not (having an equal
                              right) confiscate—not life, for we never desire it—but
                              that which is the common object of confiscation—
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6767" style="font-style: italic;">property, goods</hi>, and 
                              <hi id="d145581e6771" style="font-style: italic;">debts</hi>, which strengthen ourselves and
                              weaken our enemies? I trust that this short recapitulation
                              of events shows, that if there ever was in the
                              history of man, a case requiring the full use of all human
                              means, it was our case in the late contest; and we
                              were therefore warranted to confiscate the British debts.”

                              I shall give his whole argument on this point
                              in his own words:

                           <p id="d145581e6778">“I beg leave to add that these debts are lost on
                              another principle. By the dissolution of the British
                              government, America went into a state of nature—on
                              the dissolution of that of which we had been members,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6780"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="363" data-tei-n="350"> </a></span>
                              there being no government antecedent, we went
                              necessarily into a state of nature. To prove this, I need
                              only refer to the declaration of independence,
                              pronounced on the fourth day of July 1776, and our state
                              constitution.” (Here Mr. Henry read part of the
                              constitution.) “It recites many instances of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6782" style="font-style: italic;">misrule</hi> by the
                              king of England—it asserts the right and expediency
                              of dissolving the British government, and going into a
                              state of nature; or, in other words, to establish a new
                              government. The right of dissolving it, and forming
                              a new system, had preceded the fourth day of July 1776.
                              A recapitulation of the events of the tyrannical acts of
                              government, would demonstrate a right to dissolve it.
                              But I may go farther, and even say, that the act of
                              parliament which declared us out of the king's protection,
                              dissolved it. For what is government? It is an
                              express or implied compact between the rulers and
                              ruled, stipulating reciprocal protection and obedience.
                              That protection was withdrawn, solemnly withdrawn
                              from us. Of consequence, obedience ceased to be due.
                              Our municipal rights were taken away by one blow.
                              Municipal obligations and government, were also taken
                              away by the same blow. Well then, there being no
                              antecedent government, we returned into a state of nature.
                              Unless we did so, our new compact of government
                              could only be an usurpation. In a state of nature
                              there is no legal 
                              <hi id="d145581e6785" style="font-style: italic;">lien</hi> on the person or property of any
                              one. If you are not clear of every antecedent engagement,
                              what is the legality or strength of the present
                              constitution of government? If any antecedent
                              engagements are to bind, how far are they to reach? You
                              had no right to form a new government, if the old system
                              existed; and if it did not exist, you were necessarily
                              and inevitably in a state of nature. In my humble
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6788"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="364" data-tei-n="351"> </a></span>
                              opinion, by giving validity to such claims, you destroy
                              the very idea of the right to form a new government.
                              Vattel calls government the totality of persons, estates,
                              and effects, formed by every individual of the new
                              society, and that totality represented by the governing
                              power. How can the totality exist while an antecedent
                              right exists elsewhere? See Grotius, p. 4, which I have
                              already read, and note 29: Because the design and good
                              of civil society necessarily require, that the natural and
                              acquired rights of each member should admit of limitations
                              several ways, and to a certain degree, by the
                              authority of him or them, in whose hands the sovereign
                              authority is lodged. When we formed a new government,
                              did there exist any authority that limited our
                              rights? How can the totality exist, if any other person
                              or persons have an existing claim upon you? It appears
                              to me, that that equality which is involved in a state of
                              nature, cannot exist while such claim exists. The
                              court will recollect what I have already read out of
                              Vattel, in the 15 and 18 sections. The equality here
                              ascribed to independent nations, is equally ascribed to
                              men in a state of nature. A moral society of persons
                              cannot exist, without this absolute equality. The existence
                              of individuals in a state of nature depends in
                              like manner upon, and is inseparable from such equality.

                           <p id="d145581e6791">“Rights as before mentioned, Vattel, p. 8 and 9,
                              are divided into

                              I beseech your honours to fix this distinction in
                              your minds. The 
                              <hi id="d145581e6802" style="font-style: italic;">perfect external</hi> right only, is accompanied
                              with the right of constraint. The imperfect
                              right, loses that quality, and leaves it to the party, to
                              comply or not to comply with it. When the former
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6805"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="365" data-tei-n="352"> </a></span>
                              government was dissolved, the American people became
                              indebted to nobody. You either owe every thing
                              or nothing,—and every contract and engagement must
                              be done away, if any. In a state of nature you are free
                              and equal. But how are you free, if another has a
                              lien on your body? Where is your freedom, or your
                              equality with that person, who has the right of constraining
                              you? This right of constraint, implies a complete
                              authority over you, but not however to enslave
                              you. This constraint is always adequate to the right
                              or obligation. Where can you find the possibility of
                              this equality which nature gives her sons, if we admit
                              an existing right of constraint? If it be a fact, that
                              on the dissolution of the government we did enter into
                              a state of nature (and that we did, I humbly judge cannot
                              be denied, as at that time no government existed
                              at all) it destroys all claim to one farthing. This will
                              be found to be true as well upon the ground of equity
                              and good conscience, as in law, when it is considered,
                              that when we went into a state of nature, the means
                              of paying debts were taken away from us by them;
                              because so far as they had power over us, they
                              prevented us from getting money to pay debts. They
                              interdicted us from the pursuit of profitable commerce;
                              from getting gold and silver; the only things they would
                              take—they unjustly drove us to this extremity. By
                              the concession of the worthy gentleman, their attack
                              upon us was unjust.

                              gentlemen, because there were no inquests, no office
                              found for the commonwealth. Has a debt an ear-mark?
                              Is it tangible or visible? Has it any discriminating,
                              quality? Unless tangible or visible, how is it to be
                              ascertained or distinguished? What does an inquest mean?

                              A solemn inquiry by a jury, by ocular examination,
                              with other proofs. If an inquest of office were to be
                              had of land, a jury could tell the lines and boundaries
                              of it, because they may be distinguished from others,
                              and its identity may thereby be ascertained. If a horse be
                              the object of inquiry, he can be easily distinguished from
                              any other horse. In like manner every other article of
                              visible property may be subject to inquests; but such a
                              thing as an inquest of a debt never existed, as far as
                              my legal knowledge extends. What are to be the consequences,
                              if this proceeding be requisite? You must
                              set up a court of inquisition, summon the whole nation,
                              and ask every man, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6812" style="font-style: italic;">how much do you owe</hi>? This
                              would be productive of endless confusion, perplexity,
                              and expense, without the desired effect. The laws of
                              war and of nations, require no more than that the sovereign
                              power should openly signify its will, that the debts
                              be forfeited. There is no particular forensic form necessary.
                              The question here, is not whether this confiscation
                              be traversed in all the forms of municipal
                              regulations. There is a question between Great Britain
                              and America similar to that between Alexander and
                              the Thebans. 
                              <hi id="d145581e6815" style="font-style: italic;">Has the sovereign signified his pleasure,
                                 that debts be remitted
                              </hi>? A sign is completely sufficient,
                              if it be understood by the people. There is a necessity
                              of thus speaking the legislative will, that the other party
                              may know it, and retaliate; for what is allowed to one,
                              is to both parties. This was different from the nature
                              of a solemn war. War is lawful or unlawful, according
                              to the manner of conducting it. In the prosecution of
                              a lawful solemn war, it is necessary that you do not
                              depart from certain rules of moderation, honour, and
                              humanity, but act according to the usual practice of
                              belligerent powers. Did the mother country conduct the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6818"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="367" data-tei-n="354"> </a></span>
                              war against us in this manner? We did openly say,
                              we mean to confiscate your debts, and modify them,
                              because they have lost their perfect external quality—
                              they are imperfect—we claim that right, as a sovereign
                              people, over that species of your property. Sir, it was
                              not done in a corner. It was understood by our enemies.
                              They had a right to retaliate on any species of
                              our property they could find. The right of retaliation,
                              or just retortion, for equivalent damage on any part of
                              an enemy's property, is permitted to every nation.
                              That right has the British nation (for if the nation has
                              not the right, none of its people have) to demand a
                              breach of faith in the American government to its citizens?
                              I have already mentioned the engagement of
                              the government with its citizens respecting the paper
                              money—
                              <hi id="d145581e6820" style="font-style: italic;">If you take it, it shall be money</hi>. Shall it be
                              judged now not to be money? Shall this compact be
                              broken for the sake of the British nation? No, sir,
                              the language of national law is otherwise. Sir, the
                              laws of confiscation and paper money, made together
                              one system, connected and sanctioned by the legislature,
                              on which depended once the fate of our country,
                              and on which depend now, the happiness, the ease,
                              and comfort, of thousands of your fellow-citizens. Will
                              it not be a breach of the compact with your people, to
                              say that the money is not to keep up to its original
                              standard in the quality given it by law? What were the
                              effects of this system? What would have been the
                              effects, had your citizens been apprized that British
                              debts must be paid? Would they have taken the money?
                              Would they have deposited the money in the
                              loan office, if they had been warned by law, that they
                              must deposit it, subject to the future regulations of
                              peace; that it should not release them from the
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6824"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="368" data-tei-n="355"> </a></span>
                              creditors? However right it may appear now, to decry
                              the paper money, it would have been fatal then, for
                              America might have perished, without the aid and effect
                              of that medium. Your citizens trusting to this compact,
                              submitted to a number of things almost intolerable
                              —impressments and violences on their properly—it
                              encouraged them to exert themselves in defence of their
                              property against the enemy during the war. If the
                              debt in the declaration mentioned be recovered, the
                              compact is subverted, as respecting the paper money.
                              And this subversion is to take effect for the interest of
                              those men, whom, by all laws, human and divine, we
                              were obliged to consider as enemies; men, who were
                              obliged to comply with the regulations and requisitions
                              of their king; and our people will have been labouring,
                              not for themselves, but for the benefit of the British
                              subject. When a vessel is in danger in a storm, those
                              who abide on board of her, and encounter the dangers
                              of the sea to save her, are allowed some little compensation
                              for salvage, for their fidelity and gallantry in
                              endeavouring to prevent her loss; while those who abandon
                              her are entitled to nothing. But, in opposition to
                              this wise and politic principle, we, who have withstood
                              the storms and dangers, receive no compensation; but
                              those who left the political ship, and joined those on the
                              other side of the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6826" style="font-style: italic;">water</hi> who wished to sink her, and
                              who caused us to fight eight long years for her preservation,
                              shall come in at last, and get their full share of
                              this vessel, and yet will have been exonerated from
                              every charge. For whom then, were the people of
                              America engaged in war? Not for themselves, I am
                              sure—the property that they saved will not be for
                              themselves, but for those whom they had a right to call
                              enemies. I am not willing to ascribe to the meanest
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6829"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="369" data-tei-n="356"> </a></span>
                              American the love of money, or desire of eluding the
                              payment of his debts as the motive of engaging in the
                              war. No, sir. He had nobler and better views. But
                              he thinks himself well entitled to those debts, from the
                              laws and usages of nations, as a compensation for the
                              injuries he has sustained. There is a sad drawback on
                              this property saved. A national debt for seventeen
                              years, considerable taxes which were profusely laid
                              during the war on lands and slaves; and, since the
                              peace we have been loaded with a hearty taxation. I
                              know that I advocate this cause on a very advantageous
                              ground, when I speak of the right of salvage. The
                              cargo on board the wrecked vessel belongs to the British;
                              it will have been saved for them! but the salvage
                              is due to us only. If you take it on the ground of
                              interest—you may hold as a pledge—you may retain
                              for salvage. If you take it on the scale of the common
                              law, or of national law—you may oppose damages to
                              debts—retain the debts, to retribute and compensate
                              for the injuries they have done you. I have now got
                              over, and I trust established, the first point; that is, that
                              debts in common wars are subject to forfeiture, and
                              much more so in a revolution war like the American war.”<a href="note87" class="ref-external" n="87" rend="sc"> *</a>

                              next point thus: “My next point is that the British
                              debts being so forfeited (as I conceive) can only be
                              revived by the treaty; and unless they be so revived, they

                              are gone for ever. I will then consider how this matter
                              stands under the treaty.” He proceeds then to show
                              by authority, the rules by which treaties are to be
                              construed; and demonstrates, that a treaty can confer no
                              benefit unless it be mutually observed with good faith:
                              that perfidy on either side is a forfeiture of all its
                              advantages; that the stipulations of a treaty are in the
                              nature of conditions precedent; that a breach on either
                              side dissolves the covenant altogether, and places the
                              parties on the general ground which they occupied
                              before the treaty; that Great Britain had violated the
                              treaty, in the moment of its ratification, by carrying
                              off our slaves, and detaining with an armed force those
                              posts of which she had stipulated the immediate
                              surrender; that the presence of her having acted thus as a
                              retaliatory measure for the non-payment of the debts,
                              was an insult to common understanding, because she
                              began her infractions before any experiment had been
                              made of a recovery of the debts; that the notion of a
                              reprisal, preceding any injury—and a retaliation 
                              <hi id="d145581e6846" style="font-style: italic;">in

                              </hi>, of any wrong on the opposite side, was so far
                              from mitigating her offence, that it was a daring insult
                              on the honour and good faith of this nation! Having by
                              a series of authorities directly in point, established the
                              right of the American nation to regard the treaty as
                              abolished by any perfidious infraction of it, on the part
                              of Great Britain, he shows next that those infractions
                              were established by the pleadings in the cause; because
                              the defendant by his several pleas had specified those
                              infractions, and the plaintiff, by demurring to the pleas,
                              had admitted the truth of their averments.

                              <hi id="d145581e6852" style="font-style: italic;">as a nation</hi>, having by her own
                              perfidy forfeited all right to insist upon the treaty, and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6855"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="371" data-tei-n="358"> </a></span>
                              that treaty as 
                              <hi id="d145581e6857" style="font-style: italic;">between the nations</hi>, being annulled, the
                              next question was, whether any individual of the British
                              nation could claim any advantage under the treaty?
                              This he shows could not be done, because in making
                              the treaty, the sovereigns of the two nations acted for all
                              the individuals of their respective nations; the individuals
                              were bound by all the acts of those sovereigns,
                              whether in making or abolishing a treaty. “Here,”
                              said he, “are two moral persons, Great Britain and
                              America, making a contract. The plaintiff claims and
                              the defendant defends 
                              <hi id="d145581e6860" style="font-style: italic;">under and through them</hi>; and if
                              either nation or moral person, has no rights to benefits
                              from such contract, individuals 
                              <hi id="d145581e6863" style="font-style: italic;">claiming under them</hi>
                              can have none. The plaintiff then 
                              <hi id="d145581e6867" style="font-style: italic;">claims under his
                                 nation
                              </hi>, but if that nation have committed perfidy
                              respecting the observance of the compact, no right can
                              he carried therefrom to the plaintiff. It puts him
                              back in the same situation he was in before the treaty.”
                              He shows the absurdity of considering the treaty as
                              annulled, in relation to 
                              <hi id="d145581e6870" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> the individuals, in their
                              collective character of a nation, and yet as in full force for
                              the benefit of 
                              <hi id="d145581e6873" style="font-style: italic;">each</hi> individual separately; for if this
                              plaintiff had a right to all the beneficial effects of the
                              treaty, every man in England had the same right; and
                              he cites and reads from Vattel, a conclusive authority
                              to show that the conventional law of nations could take
                              its effect only from universal right, extending equally
                              to all the citizens or individuals of a nation. But to
                              say, that America had a right to consider the treaty as
                              void against all the individuals of the British nation,
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e6876" style="font-style: italic;">collectively</hi>, while each and every individual of that
                              nation 
                              <hi id="d145581e6879" style="font-style: italic;">separately</hi>, could enforce it upon her, was to
                              offer to the understanding, a paradoxical absurdity,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6882"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="372" data-tei-n="359"> </a></span>
                              as insulting to common sense, as the conduct of
                              Great Britain had been to the honour of the American
                              nation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6885">He contended further on this point, that if the treaty
                              had been observed by Great Britain, and were of
                              consequence, still obligatory, it did not and could not operate
                              where monies had been actually paid into the treasury
                              under the laws of the state: for the provision of the treaty
                              is, “that creditors on either side should meet with no
                              lawful impediment to the recovery of all 
                              <hi id="d145581e6887" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide debts</hi>
                              heretofore contracted.” The defendant, said he, having
                              paid the money into the treasury according to the
                              act of assembly, and the truth of the payment being
                              admitted in the record, this article of the treaty could
                              not support the plaintiff's claim. “To derive a benefit
                              from the treaty, the plaintiff must demand a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6890" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</hi>
                              debt: that is, a debt 
                              <hi id="d145581e6893" style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</hi> due. The word 
                              <hi id="d145581e6896" style="font-style: italic;">debt</hi>
                              implies that the thing is due; for if it be not 
                              <hi id="d145581e6899" style="font-style: italic;">due</hi>, how
                              can it be a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6903" style="font-style: italic;">debt</hi>? To give to these words, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6906" style="font-style: italic;">all debts
                                 heretofore contracted
                              </hi>, a strictly literal sense, would be
                              to authorize a renewed demand for debts which had
                              been actually paid onto the creditor; for these were
                              certainly within 
                              <hi id="d145581e6909" style="font-style: italic;">the words</hi> of the treaty, being

                              dishonest consequence, you must look at the intention of
                              the thing; and the intention certainly was to embrace
                              those cases where there had not been a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6915" style="font-style: italic;">legal payment</hi>.
                              I ask,” said he, “why a payment made in gold and
                              silver is a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6918" style="font-style: italic;">legal payment</hi>? Because the coin of those
                              metals is made current by the laws of this country?
                              If paper be made current by the same authority, why
                              should not a payment in 
                              <hi id="d145581e6922" style="font-style: italic;">it</hi>, be equally valid? The
                              British subject cannot demand payment, because I confront
                              his demand with a receipt. Why will a receipt
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6925"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="373" data-tei-n="360"> </a></span>
                              discharge in any instance?—because it is founded on
                              the laws of the country. A receipt given in consequence
                              of a payment in coin, is a legal discharge, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6927" style="font-style: italic;">only
                                 because the laws of the country make it so
                              </hi>. I ask then
                              why a receipt given in consequence of a payment into
                              the treasury, be not of equal validity, since it has
                              precisely the same foundation? It is expressly constituted
                              a 
                              <hi id="d145581e6930" style="font-style: italic;">discharge</hi> by a legislature having competent authority.
                              This debt therefore, having been 
                              <hi id="d145581e6933" style="font-style: italic;">legally</hi> paid by the
                              contractor, was not 
                              <hi id="d145581e6936" style="font-style: italic;">due</hi> from him at the time of making
                              the treaty, and therefore is not within the intention of
                              that instrument. But, say the gentlemen on the other
                              side, the one payment has the consent of the creditor,
                              and the other has not: he who paid coin has the
                              creditor's consent to the discharge, but he who paid
                              money into the treasury, wants it. Have we not satisfied
                              this honourable court, that the governing power
                              had a right to put itself in the place of the British
                              subjects? Having had an unquestionable right to confiscate,
                              sequester, or modify those debts as they pleased, they
                              had an equally indubitable right to substitute themselves
                              in the stead of the plaintiff, otherwise those authorities
                              have been quoted in vain.” He then cites authorities
                              to prove, that the law of the place governs the contract;
                              and concludes, that the payment into the treasury having
                              in this instance, been made in consequence of a
                              law of this commonwealth, which was strictly consonant
                              with the laws of nations, and which had declared
                              that such payment 
                              <hi id="d145581e6940" style="font-style: italic;">should operate as a complete and
                                 final discharge
                              </hi>, this was not a subsisting 
                              <hi id="d145581e6943" style="font-style: italic;">debt</hi>, within the
                              contemplation of the treaty, and remained therefore
                              wholly unaffected by it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e6947">The next question was, whether 
                              <hi id="d145581e6949" style="font-style: italic;">this court</hi> could take
                              notice of this infraction of the treaty, on the part of
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6952"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="374" data-tei-n="361"> </a></span>
                              Great Britain, and found their judgment upon it. On
                              this question, he observes that the court were not
                              called upon to step out of their appropriate sphere, in
                              order to invade the province of the jury by trying facts;
                              the facts were all agreed by the pleadings; the court
                              were merely called upon to say what was the law
                              arising on those facts. The existence or non-existence
                              of the treaty, was a legal inference from the facts
                              agreed; which the court alone were competent to decide.
                              The plaintiff himself had forced this question
                              on the court, by relying in his replication on the treaty
                              as restoring his right to recover this debt. He sets up
                              his right under this instrument expressly, and then
                              questions the jurisdiction of the court to decide upon
                              the instrument! The treaty, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6954" style="font-style: italic;">
                                 
                                 <foreign id="d145581e6956" xml:lang="lat">quoad hoc</foreign>
                                 
                              </hi>, is the covenant
                              of the parties in this suit: the question presented by
                              the pleadings is, whether the plaintiff, who by that
                              covenant, has taken upon himself the performance of
                              a precedent condition, can claim any benefit under it
                              until he shall show that this precedent condition has
                              been performed. On this question said he, the gentleman's
                              argument is, that the court have no power to decide
                              on the construction of the covenant, which he himself
                              has brought before them; that they have nothing
                              to do with the dependence or independence of the
                              stipulations, or the reciprocal rights of the parties, to
                              claim under the covenant, without showing a previous
                              performance on their respective parts! 
                              <hi id="d145581e6960" style="font-style: italic;">He</hi>, on the contrary,
                              insisted that under the constitution of the United
                              States, the question belonged, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6963" style="font-style: italic;">peculiarly and exclusively</hi>,
                              to the judicial department: that by the constitution,
                              it was expressly provided that the judicial power
                              should extend  
                              <hi id="d145581e6967" style="font-style: italic;">to all cases arising under treaties</hi>: that
                              the law of treaties embraced the whole extent of natural
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6970"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="375" data-tei-n="362"> </a></span>
                              and national law; that the constitution therefore, by
                              referring all cases arising under treaties, to the judiciary,
                              had of necessity invested them with the power
                              of appealing to that code of laws, by which alone the
                              construction, the operation, the efficacy, the legal
                              existence or non-existence of treaties, must be tested: and
                              by this code, they were told in the most emphatic terms,
                              that he who violates one article of a treaty, releases
                              the other party from the performance of any part of it;
                              that the reference of all cases arising under treaties, to
                              the judicial department, calcified with it every power
                              near or remote, direct or collateral, which was essential
                              to a fair and just decision of those cases;—that in every
                              such case, the very first question was, 
                              <hi id="d145581e6972" style="font-style: italic;">is</hi> there a treaty
                              or not?—not whether there 
                              <hi id="d145581e6975" style="font-style: italic;">has been</hi> a treaty—but
                              whether there 
                              <hi id="d145581e6978" style="font-style: italic;">is</hi> an 
                              <hi id="d145581e6981" style="font-style: italic;">existing, obligatory, operative
                                 treaty
                              </hi>. To decide this question, the court must bring
                              the facts to the standard of the laws of nations; and by
                              this standard it had been shown, that in the case at
                              bar, there existed no treaty, from which a British subject
                              could claim any benefit. That if the judicial department
                              had not the power of deciding this question,
                              there was no department in the American government
                              which did possess it: the state governments have nothing
                              to do with it—congress cannot touch the subject
                              —they may indeed, declare war for a violation; but
                              a nation was not to be forced to this extremity, on every
                              occasion; there were other modes of redress, short of
                              a declaration of war, to which nations had a right to
                              resort; and one of them, as he had shown, was the power
                              of withholding from the perfidious violator of a treaty,
                              those benefits which he claimed under it. Now, congress
                              could not by a law declare a treaty void—it is not
                              among those grants of power which the constitution
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e6985"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="376" data-tei-n="363"> </a></span>
                              makes to them; they cannot therefore, meddle with
                              the subject in any other way than by a declaration of
                              war; neither can the president and senate touch it. They
                              can 
                              <hi id="d145581e6987" style="font-style: italic;">make</hi> treaties; but the constitution gives them no
                              power to 
                              <hi id="d145581e6990" style="font-style: italic;">expound</hi> a treaty; much less to 
                              <hi id="d145581e6993" style="font-style: italic;">declare it void</hi>:
                              they can only unite with the house of representatives,
                              in punishing an infraction by a declaration of war. To
                              the judiciary alone, then, belongs this pacific power
                              of withholding legal benefits, claimed under a treaty,
                              because of the 
                              <hi id="d145581e6996" style="font-style: italic;">mala fides</hi> of the party claiming them.
                              Now, what will be the situation of this country, compared
                              with that of Great Britain, if you deny this power
                              to the judiciary? If you have not observed the treaty
                              with good faith, and go to England, claiming any
                              benefit under the treaty, there is a power there, called
                              royal prerogative, which will tell you—no—go home
                              and act honestly, and you shall have your rights under
                              the treaty. Your breach of faith will not drive 
                              <hi id="d145581e6999" style="font-style: italic;">them</hi> to
                              a declaration of war—there is a power there which
                              obtains redress by withholding your rights, until you
                              act with good faith: but where is the recriprocal and
                              corresponding power in our government, if it be not
                              in the judiciary? It is no where;—we have no redress
                              short of a declaration of war. Is this one of the precious
                              fruits of the adoption of the federal constitution,
                              to bind us hand and foot with the fetters of technicality,
                              and leave us no way of bursting them asunder, but by a
                              declaration of war, and the effusion of human blood!
                              It was never intended. The wisdom and virtue which
                              framed the constitution, could never have intended to
                              place the county in this humiliating and awful predicament.
                              Give to this power of deciding on treaties,

                              necessary to carry it into effect—open to them the whole
                              region of natural and national law, which furnish the
                              only rule of expounding those national compacts, called
                              treaties, and your government is unmutilated, its
                              measure of power is full up to the exigencies of the
                              nation, and you treat on equal terms: but upon the
                              opposite construction, much better would it be that
                              America should have no treaties at all, than that having
                              them, she should want those means of enforcement
                              and redress, which all other nations possess.

                              confiscation in common wars, and much more so in the
                              war of the revolution—that Virginia was an independent
                              nation, and, as such, competent to the exercise of
                              this right of eminent domain—of taking to herself the
                              debts of her enemies—that she had in fact exercised
                              this right, and that this debt, had under one of her laws
                              of that character, been legally discharged—that the
                              treaty had no effect in reviving the claim, because the
                              treaty had been annulled by the infractions of it on the
                              part of Great Britain—and because if it had not, this was
                              not a subsisting debt, within the purview of the treaty
                              —and, finally, that the court's jurisdiction extended
                              to every question touching the continuance or annulment
                              of treaties. He said, he had now finished his
                              own view of the subject, and should have taken his
                              seat, but for the necessity of giving a 
                              <hi id="d145581e7008" style="font-style: italic;">particular</hi> answer
                              to the various objections to these principles,
                              which had been so ably urged by the counsel for the
                              plaintiff. In this part of his subject he shows the most
                              masterly acuteness, address, and vigour. A gentleman

                              circumstances of his manner, with a very interesting
                              minuteness. “Mr. Henry,” he said, “had taken ample
                              notes of the arguments of his adversaries: the people
                              would give him his own time to examine his notes, and
                              select the argument or remark that he meant to make
                              the subject of his comments, observing in these pauses
                              the most profound silence. If the answer which he
                              was about to give was a short one, he would give it,
                              without removing his spectacles from his nose but if
                              he was ever seen to give his spectacles a cant to the top
                              of his wig, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7022" style="font-style: italic;">it was a declaration of war</hi>, and his adversaries
                              must stand clear.”

                           <p id="d145581e7026">I propose to give a few specimens only of his mode
                              of answering the arguments of the opposing counsel.
                              It had been urged by them, that the laws of nations had
                              declared only the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7028" style="font-style: italic;">estate</hi> of an alien enemy liable to
                              confiscation—but that debts were mere 
                              <hi id="d145581e7031" style="font-style: italic;">rights—choses in
                                 action
                              </hi>—and therefore not of a confiscable character.
                              His answer to this, is a happy mixture of ridicule and
                              argument. It is short, and I shall give it in his own words.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7036">“But a 
                              <hi id="d145581e7038" style="font-style: italic;">chose</hi> in action is not liable to forfeiture.
                              Why? Because it is too terrible to be done. There
                              is such a thing as 
                              <hi id="d145581e7041" style="font-style: italic;">straining at a gnat, and swallowing a
                                 camel
                              </hi>. Things much more terrible 
                              <hi id="d145581e7044" style="font-style: italic;">have been done</hi>—
                              things, from which our nature, where it has any
                              pretensions to be pure and correct, must recoil with horror.
                              Show me those laws which forfeit your life, attaint your
                              blood, and beggar your wife and children. Those
                              sanguinary and inhuman laws, to which every thing
                              valuable must yield, are to be found in the code of that
                              people, under whom the plaintiff now claims. Is it so
                              terrible to confiscate 
                              <hi id="d145581e7047" style="font-style: italic;">debts</hi>, when 
                              <hi id="d145581e7050" style="font-style: italic;">they</hi> forfeit 
                              <hi id="d145581e7054" style="font-style: italic;">life</hi>, and

                              other thing dear to humanity is forfeitable, yet 
                              <hi id="d145581e7062" style="font-style: italic;">debts</hi>, it
                              seems, must be spared! Debts are too sacred to be
                              touched! It is a mercantile idea, that worships Mammon,
                              instead of God. A 
                              <hi id="d145581e7065" style="font-style: italic;">chose</hi> in action shall pass—it
                              is without your reach. What authority can they adduce
                              in support of such conclusive pre-eminence for debts?
                              No political or human institution has placed them above
                              other things. If debt be the most sacred of all earthly
                              obligations, I am uninformed from whence it has
                              derived that eminence. The principle is to be found in
                              the day books, journals, and ledgers of merchants; not
                              in the writings or reasonings of the wise and well informed
                              —the enlightened instructors of mankind. Can
                              any gentleman allow me any instance, where the life or
                              property of a gentleman or plebeian in England is
                              forfeited, and yet his debts spared? The state can claim
                              debts due to one guilty of high treason. Are they not
                              subject to confiscation? I concur in that sound principle,
                              that good faith is essential to the happiness of mankind;
                              that its want, stops all human intercourse, and
                              renders us miserable. This principle is permanent, and
                              universal. Look to what point of the compass you
                              will, you will find it pervading all nations. Who does
                              not set down its sacred influence as the only thing that
                              comforts human life? 
                              <hi id="d145581e7068" style="font-style: italic;">Does the plaintiff claim through
                                 good faith
                              </hi>? How does 
                              <hi id="d145581e7072" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> derive his claim?

                              <hi id="d145581e7078" style="font-style: italic;">polluted channel</hi>. Every thing of
                              that kind would have come better from our side of the
                              question, than from theirs.”

                              and that no act of the legislature had, in fact, directly
                              forfeited these debts. In answer to this, Mr. Henry
                              says, “But the gentleman has observed, that neither the

                              property vested in the commonwealth, nor any other act
                              passed on the subject, could divest the debts out of the
                              British creditors. It cannot be done without the
                              solemnity of an inquiry by a jury. The debt of A or B
                              cannot be given to C, without this solemnity. Is the
                              little legality of forms, which are necessary when you
                              speak of estates and titles, requisite on such mighty
                              occasions as these? When the fate of a nation is
                              concerned, you are to speak the language of nature. When
                              your very existence is at stake, are you to speak the
                              technical language of books, and to be confined to the
                              limited rules of technical criticism?—to those tricks
                              and quirks—those little twists and twirls of low

                              defendant relied; and in the course of his observations,
                              had unfortunately used the remark, that Virginia was,
                              at that time, nothing more than a 
                              <hi id="d145581e7100" style="font-style: italic;">revolted colony</hi>.
                              When Mr. Henry came to notice this remark, he gave
                              his spectacles the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7103" style="font-style: italic;">war cant</hi>: “But another observation,”
                              said he, “was made; that by the law of nations
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7106" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> had not a right to legislate on the subject of British
                              debts—we were not an independent nation—and I
                              thought,” said he, raising himself aloft, while his frame
                              dilated itself beyond the ordinary size, “that I heard
                              the word— 
                              <hi id="d145581e7109" style="font-style: italic;">revolt</hi>!” At this word, he turned upon Mr.
                              Ronald, his piercing eye, and knit his brows at him,
                              with an expression of indignation and contempt, which
                              seemed almost to annihilate him. It was like a stroke
                              of lightning. Mr. Ronald shrunk from the withering
                              look: and, pale and breathless, cast down his eyes,
                              “seeming,” says my informant, “to be in quest of an
                              auger hole, by which he might drop through the floor,
                              and escape for ever from mortal sight.” Mr. Henry
                              perceived his suffering, and his usual good nature
                              immediately returned to him. He raised his eyes gently
                              towards the court, and shaking his head, slowly, with an
                              an expression of regret, added, “I wish I had not
                              heard it: for although innocently meant (and I am sure
                              that it was so, from the character of the gentleman who
                              mentioned it) yet the sound displeases me—it is
                              unpleasant.” Mr. Ronald breathed again, and looked up, and
                              his generous adversary dismissed the topic, to resume
                              it no more.

                           <p id="d145581e7113">It may give the reader some idea of the amplitude of
                              this argument, when he is told, that Mr. Henry was
                              engaged three days successively in its delivery, and some
                              faint conception of the enchantment which he threw
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7115"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="382" data-tei-n="369"> </a></span>
                              over it, when he learns that although it turned entirely
                              on questions of law, yet the audience mixed as it was,
                              seemed so far from being wearied, that they followed
                              him throughout, with increased enjoyment. The room
                              continued full to the last; and such was the “the listening
                              silence” with which he was heard, that not a syllable
                              that he uttered, is believed to have been lost. When he
                              finally sat down, the concourse rose, with a general murmur
                              of admiration; the scene resembled the breaking
                              up and dispersion of a great theatrical assembly,
                              which had been enjoying for the first time, the
                              exhibition of some new and splendid drama: the
                              speaker of the house of delegates, was at length able
                              to command a 
                              <hi id="d145581e7117" style="font-style: italic;">quorum</hi> for business; and every quarter
                              of the city, and at length, every part of the
                              state, was filled with the echoes of Mr. Henry's
                              eloquent speech.

                           <p id="d145581e7121">His practice, during these last years, of which we
                              are now speaking, was confined pretty generally to
                              cases of consequences. He did not like the profession
                              and was not willing to embark in any case, for the
                              ordinary fees. I have an interesting sketch of him, in
                              his professional character, during those years, from the
                              same elegant pen, which in a former page exhibits the
                              parallel between him and Mr. Lee, in 1784: it is as follows:

                           <p id="d145581e7124">“At the bar, Mr. Henry was eminently successful.
                              When I saw him there, he must, from the course of his
                              life, which had been chiefly political, have become
                              somewhat rusty in the learning of his profession: yet I
                              considered him as a good lawyer: he seemed to be well
                              acquainted with the rules and canons of property. He
                              would not, indeed, undergo the drudgery necessary for
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7126"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="383" data-tei-n="370"> </a></span>
                              complicated business; yet I am told, that in the British
                              debt cause, he astonished the public not less by the matter,
                              than the manner of his speech. It was however as
                              a criminal lawyer, that his eloquence had the fairest
                              scope, and in that character I have seen him. He
                              was perfect master of the passions of his auditory,
                              whether in the tragic, or comic line. The tones of his
                              voice, to say nothing of his matter and gesture, were
                              insinuated into the feelings of his hearers, in a manner
                              that baffles all description. It seemed to operate by
                              mere sympathy; and by his tones alone, it seemed to me,
                              that he could make you cry or laugh at pleasure. I will
                              endeavour to give you some account of this magic, and
                              comic effect in two instances, which I witnessed.”

                           <p id="d145581e7130">“Almost the year 1792, one Holland killed a young
                              man in Botetourt. The young man was popular, and
                              lived, I think, with Mr. King, a wealthy merchant in
                              Fincastle, who employed Mr. John Brackenridge to
                              assist in the prosecution of Holland. This Holland
                              had gone up from the county of Louisa as a schoolmaster,
                              but had turned out badly, and was unpopular.
                              The killing was in the night, and was generally believed
                              to be 
                              <hi id="d145581e7132" style="font-style: italic;">murder</hi>. He was the son of one doctor Holland,
                              who was yet living in Louisa, and had been one of Mr.
                              Henry's juvenile friends and acquaintances. It was
                              chiefly at the instance of the father, and for a very
                              moderate fee, that Mr. Henry undertook to go out to the
                              district court of Greenbrier, to defend the prisoner.
                              Such were the prejudices there, that the people had
                              openly and repeatedly declared that even Patrick
                              Henry need not come to defend Holland, unless he
                              brought a jury with him. On the day of trial, the
                              court house was crowded. I did not move from my
                              seat for fourteen hours; and had no wish to do so.
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7135"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="384" data-tei-n="371"> </a></span>
                              The examination of the witnesses took up great part
                              of the time, and the lawyers were probably exhausted.
                              Brackenridge was eloquent; but Henry left no dry eye
                              in the court house. The case I believe was 
                              <hi id="d145581e7137" style="font-style: italic;">murder</hi>;
                              though 
                              <hi id="d145581e7140" style="font-style: italic;">possibly, manslaughter only</hi>. Mr. Henry laid
                              hold of this possibility with such effect, as to make all
                              forget that Holland had killed the store-keeper at all;
                              and presented the deplorable case of the jury's killing
                              Holland, an innocent man. By that force of description
                              which he possessed in so wonderful a degree, he
                              exhibited, as it were, at the clerk's table, old Holland
                              and his wife, who were then in Louisa; but the drawing
                              was so powerful, and so true to nature, that we
                              seemed to see them before us, and to hear them asking
                              of the jury, ‘where is our son? what have you done
                              with him?’ All this was done in a manner so solemn
                              and touching, and a tone so irresistible, that it was
                              impossible for the stoutest heart not to take sides with the
                              criminal: as for the jury, they lost sight of the murder
                              they were trying, and wept most profusely, with old
                              Holland and his wife, whom Mr. Henry painted, and
                              perhaps proved to be very respectable. During the
                              examination of the evidence, the bloody clothes had
                              been brought in: Mr. Henry objected to their exhibition,
                              and applied most forcibly and pathetically Anthony's
                              remark on Caesar's wounds, on those 
                              <hi id="d145581e7143" style="font-style: italic;">dumb
                                 mouths

                              mutiny. He urged that this sight would totally deprive
                              the jury of their judgment, which would be merged in
                              their 
                              <hi id="d145581e7147" style="font-style: italic;">feelings</hi>. The court was divided, and the motion
                              fell. The result of the trial was, that after the retirement
                              of an half or quarter of an hour, the jury brought
                              in a verdict of 
                              <hi id="d145581e7150" style="font-style: italic;">not guilty</hi>; but on being reminded by
                              the court that they might find a degree of homicide,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7153"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="385" data-tei-n="372"> </a></span>
                              inferior to murder, they altered their verdict to 
                              <hi id="d145581e7155" style="font-style: italic;">guilty
                                 of manslaughter

                           <p id="d145581e7159">“Mr. Henry was not less successful in the comic
                              line, when it became necessary to resort to it. You have
                              no doubt heard how he defeated John Hook, by raising
                              the cry of

                              instance. In the year 1798, there were many suits on
                              the south side of James river, for inflicting Lynch's
                              law.<a href="note89" class="ref-external" n="89" rend="sc"> *</a> A verdict of five hundred pounds had been given
                              in Prince Edward district court, in a case of this kind.
                              This alarmed the defendant in the next case, who
                              employed Mr. Henry to defend him. The case was, that
                              a waggoner and the plaintiff were travelling to Richmond
                              together, when the waggoner knocked down a
                              turkey, and put it into his waggon. Complaint was
                              made to the defendant, a justice of the peace; both the
                              parties were taken up, and the waggoner agreed to take
                              a whipping, rather than be sent to jail: but the plaintiff
                              refused: the justice, however, gave him also a small
                              flagellation; and for this the suit was brought. The plaintiff,
                              by way of taking off the force of the defence, insisted,
                              that he was wholly innocent of the act committed. Mr.
                              Henry, on the contrary, contended, that he was a party,
                              present, aiding, and assisting. In the course of his
                              remarks, he expressed himself thus: ‘But, gentlemen
                              of the jury, the plaintiff tells you he had nothing to do
                              with the turkey—I dare say, gentlemen,

                           <p id="d145581e7186">The case of John Hook, to which my correspondent
                              alludes, is worthy of insertion. Hook was a Scotchman,
                              a man of wealth, and suspected of being unfriendly to
                              the American cause. During the distresses of the
                              American army, consequent on the joint invasion of
                              Cornwallis and Phillips in 1781, a Mr. Venable, an army
                              commissary, had taken two of Hook's steers for the use
                              of the troops. The act had not been strictly legal, and
                              on the establishment of peace, Hook, under the advice
                              of Mr. Cowan, a gentleman of some distinction in the
                              law, thought proper to bring an action of trespass against
                              Mr. Venable, in the district court of New London. Mr.
                              Henry appeared for the defendant, and is said to have
                              disported himself in this cause to the infinite enjoyment
                              of his hearers, the unfortunate Hook always excepted.
                              After Mr. Henry became animated in the cause, says a
                              correspondent,<a href="note90" class="ref-external" n="90" rend="sc"> *</a> he appeared to have complete controul
                              over the passions of his audience: at one time he
                              excited their indignation against Hook: vengeance was
                              visible in every countenance: again, when he chose to
                              relax and ridicule him, the whole audience was in a
                              roar of laughter. He painted the distresses of the
                              American army, exposed almost naked to the rigour of
                              a winter's sky, and marking the frozen ground over
                              which they marched, with the blood of their unshod

                              open his fields, his barns, his cellars, the doors of his
                              house, the portals of his breast, to have received with
                              open arms, the meanest soldier in that little band of
                              famished patriots? Where is the man?—
                              <hi id="d145581e7199" style="font-style: italic;">There</hi> he
                              stands—but whether the heart of an American beats
                              in his bosom, you, gentlemen, are to judge. He then
                              carried the jury, by the powers of his imagination, to
                              the plains around York, the surrender of which had
                              followed shortly after the act complained of: he depicted
                              the surrender in the most glowing and noble colours of
                              his eloquence—the audience saw before their eyes the
                              humiliation and dejection of the British, as they marched
                              out of their trenches—they saw the triumph which
                              lighted up every patriotic face, and heard the shouts of
                              victory, and the cry of Washington and liberty, as it
                              rung and echoed through the American ranks, and was
                              reverberated from the hills and shores of the neighbouring
                              river—“but, hark, what notes of discord are these
                              which disturb the general joy, and silence the acclamations
                              of victory-—they are the notes of

                              hoarsely bawling through the American camp,

                           <p id="d145581e7210">The whole audience were convulsed: a particular incident
                              will give a better idea of the effect, than any
                              general description. The clerk of the court, unable to
                              command himself, and unwilling to commit any breach
                              of decorum in his place, rushed out of the court house,
                              and threw himself on the grass, in the most violent
                              paroxysm of laughter, where he was rolling, when
                              Hook, with very different feelings, came out, for relief
                              into the yard also. “Jemmy Steptoe,” said he to the
                              clerk, “what the devil ails ye, mon?” Mr. Steptoe
                              was only able to say, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7212" style="font-style: italic;">that he could not help it</hi>. “Never
                              mind ye,” said Hook; “wait till Billy Cowan gets up:
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7215"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="388" data-tei-n="375"> </a></span>

                              completely overwhelmed by the torrent which bore
                              upon his client, that when he rose to reply to Mr.
                              Henry, he was scarcely able to make an intelligible or
                              audible remark. The cause was decided almost by
                              acclamation. The jury retired for form sake, and
                              instantly returned with a verdict for the defendant.
                              Nor did the effect of Mr. Henry's speech stop here.
                              The people were so highly excited by the tory audacity
                              of such a suit, that Hook began to hear around him a
                              cry more terrible than that of 
                              <hi id="d145581e7220" style="font-style: italic;">beef</hi>: it was the cry of
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7223" style="font-style: italic;">tar and feathers</hi>: from the application of which, it is
                              said, that nothing saved him but a precipitate flight
                              and the speed of his horse.

                           <p id="d145581e7227">I have not attempted, in the course of these sketches,
                              to follow Mr. Henry through his professional career. I
                              have no materials to justify such an attempt. It has
                              been indeed, stated to me, in general, that he appeared
                              in such and such a case, and that he shone with great
                              lustre; but neither his speeches in those cases, nor any
                              point of his argument, nor even any brilliant passage
                              has been communicated, so that the sketch that could
                              be given of them, must be either confined to a measly
                              catalogue of the causes, or the canvass must be filled up
                              by my own fancy, which would at once, be an act of
                              injustice to Mr. Henry, and a departure from that historical
                              veracity, which it has been my anxious study, in
                              every instance, to observe.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7230">I have been told, for example, that in the year 1774,
                              Mr. Henry appeared at the bar of the general court
                              in defence of a married man by the name of Henry
                              Bullard, indicted for the murder of a beautiful girl,
                              who lived in his house, to whom he had unfortunately
                              become attached, and whom, in a moment of frantic
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7232"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="389" data-tei-n="376"> </a></span>
                              despair, he sacrificed to his hopeless passion. The
                              defence is said to have been placed on the ground of
                              insanity; and it is easy to conceive in general, the figure
                              which Mr. Henry must have made in such a cause.
                              Those pathetic powers of eloquence, in which he was
                              so pre-eminently great, had ample scope for their
                              exercise in this ease; and we can credit, without difficulty,
                              the assertion, that he deluged the house with tears, and
                              effected the acquittal of his client. But this is all that
                              we know of the case.<a href="note91" class="ref-external" n="91" rend="sc"> *</a>

                           <p id="d145581e7239">So also, I learn that, on some occasion, after the war,
                              he appeared at the bar of the house of delegates, in
                              support of a petition of the officers of the Virginia line, who
                              sought to be placed on the footing of those who had
                              been taken on continental establishment: and that, after
                              having depicted their services and their sufferings, in
                              colours which filled every heart with sympathy and
                              gratitude, he dropped on his knees, at the bar of the
                              house, and presented such an appeal as might almost
                              have softened rocks, and bent the knotted oak. Yet
                              no vestige of this splendid speech remains; nor have I
                              been able, after the most diligent inquiries, to ascertain
                              the year in which it occurred; similar petitions
                              having been presented, for several successive sessions.

                              to his profession, and retired to the bosom of his own
                              family. He retired, loaded with honours, public and

                                    of 1774 for the murder of Mary Pinner, this honour claimed by my correspondent
                                    for Mr. Henry, is not due: for the records of the general court
                                    show, that the indictment, although originally drawn for the charge of
                                    murder, was reduced to manslaughter by the grand jury; of which offence the
                                    prisoner was convicted. There is, probably, some mistake in the name.

                              gratitude, the confidence, and the love of his country.
                              No man had ever passed through so long a life of
                              public service, with a reputation more perfectly unspotted.
                              Nor had Mr. Henry on any occasion, sought security
                              from censure, by that kind of prudent silence and
                              temporizing neutrality, which politicians so frequently
                              observe. On the contrary, his course had been uniformly
                              active, bold, intrepid, and independent on
                              every great subject of public interest, the part which
                              he had taken was open, decided, manly; his country
                              saw his motives, heard his reasons, approved his conduct,
                              rested upon his virtue, and his vigour; and contemplated
                              with amazement, the evolution and unremitted
                              display of his transcendent talents. For more than
                              thirty years, he had now stood before that country—
                              open to the scrutiny and the censure of the invidious
                              —yet he retired, not only without spot or blemish, but
                              with all his laurels blooming full and fresh upon him—
                              followed by the blessings of his almost adoring countrymen,
                              and cheered by that most exquisite of all early
                              possessions—the consciousness of having in deed and
                              in truth, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7252" style="font-style: italic;">played well his part</hi>. He had now too, become
                              disembarrassed of debt; his fortune was affluent; and he
                              enjoyed in his retirement, that ease and dignity which
                              no man ever more richly deserved.

                              universal; that there never was a man better constituted
                              than Mr. Henry, to enjoy and to adorn the retirement,
                              on which he had now entered. Nothing can be
                              more amiable, nothing more interesting and attaching,
                              than those pictures which have been furnished from
                              every quarter, without one dissentient stroke of the
                              pencil, of this great and virtuous man in the bosom of
                              private life. Mr. Jefferson says, that “he was the best
                              humoured companion in the world.” His disposition
                              was indeed all sweetness—his affections were warm,
                              kind, and social—his patience invincible—his temper
                              ever unclouded, cheerful, and serene—his manners
                              plain, open, familiar, and simple—his conversation
                              easy, ingenuous, and unaffected—full of entertainment,
                              full of instruction, and irradiated with all those light
                              and softer graces, which his genius threw without
                              effort, over the most common subjects. It is said that
                              there stood in the court, before his door, a large walnut
                              tree, under whose shade it was his delight to pass
                              his summer evenings, surrounded by his affectionate
                              and happy family, and by a circle of neighbours who
                              loved him almost to idolatry. Here he would disport
                              himself with all the careless gaiety of infancy. Here
                              too, he would sometimes warm the bosoms of the old,
                              and strike fire from the eyes of his younger hearers, by
                              recounting the tales of other times; by sketching, with
                              the boldness of a master's hand, those great historic
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7269"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="392" data-tei-n="379"> </a></span>
                              incidents in which he had borne a part; and by drawing
                              to the life, and placing before his audience, in
                              colours as fresh and strong as those of nature, the
                              many illustrious men in every quarter of the continent,
                              with whom he had acted a part on the public stage.
                              Here too, he would occasionally discourse with all the
                              wisdom and all the eloquence of a Grecian sage, of the
                              various duties and offices of life; and pour forth those
                              lessons of practical utility, with which long experience
                              and observation had stored his mind. Many were the
                              visitors from a distance, old and young, who came on a
                              kind of pious pilgrimage, to the retreat of the veteran
                              patriot, and found him thus delightfully and usefully
                              employed—the old to gaze upon him with long remembered
                              affection, and ancient gratitude—the young, the
                              ardent, and the emulous, to behold and admire, with
                              swimming eyes, the champion of other days, and to
                              look with a sigh of generous regret, upon that height
                              of glory which they could never hope to reach. Blessed
                              be the shade of that venerable tree—ever hallowed the
                              spot which his genius has consecrated! Mr. Henry
                              received these visits, with all his characteristic plainness
                              and modesty; and never failed to reward the fatigue of
                              the journey, by the warmest welcome, and by the
                              unceremonious and fascinating familiarity, with which he
                              would at once enter into conversation with his new
                              guests, and cause them to forget that they were
                              strangers, or abroad. Nor must the reader suppose
                              that in these conversations he assumed any airs of superiority;
                              much less that his conversation was, as in some
                              of our conspicuous men, a continued, imperious, and
                              didactic lecture. On the contrary, he carried into private
                              life, all those principles of equality which had
                              governed him in public. That ascendancy indeed,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7271"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="393" data-tei-n="380"> </a></span>
                              which proceeded from the superior energy of his mind,
                              and the weight of his character, would manifest itself
                              unavoidably, in the deference of his companions: but
                              there was nothing in his manner which would have ever
                              reminded them of it. On the contrary, it seemed to
                              be his study to cause them to forget it, and to decoy
                              them into a free and equal interchange of thought. If
                              he took the lead in conversation, it was not because he
                              sought it; but because it was forced upon him, by that
                              silent delight with which he perceived that his company
                              preferred to listen to him.

                           <p id="d145581e7274">But it was in the bosom of his own family, where
                              the eye of every visitor and even every neighbour was
                              shut out—where neither the love of fame, nor the fear
                              of censure, could be suspected of throwing a false
                              light upon his character—it was in that very scene, in
                              which it has been said that “no man is a hero,” that Mr.
                              Henry's heroism shone with the most engaging beauty. It
                              was to his wife, to his children, to his servants, that his
                              true character was best known: to this grateful, devoted,
                              happy circle, were best known the patient and tender
                              forbearance, the kind indulgence, the forgiving mildness,
                              and sweetness of his spirit, those pure and warm
                              affections, which were always looking out for the means
                              of improving their felicity, and that watchful prudence
                              and circumspection, which guarded them from harm.
                              What can be more amiable than the playful tenderness
                              with which he joined in the sports of his little children,
                              and the boundless indulgence with which he received
                              and returned their caresses? “His visitors,” says one
                              of my correspondents, “have not infrequently caught
                              him lying on the floor, with a group of these little ones,
                              climbing over him in every direction, or dancing around
                              him, with obstreperous mirth, to the tune of his violin,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7276"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="394" data-tei-n="381"> </a></span>
                              while the only contest seemed to be who should make
                              the most noise.” If there be any bachelor so cold of
                              heart as to be offended at this anecdote, I can only
                              remind him of the remark of the great Agesilaus to
                              the friend who found him riding on a stick among his
                              children, “
                              <hi id="d145581e7278" style="font-style: italic;">don't mention it, till you are yourself a father</hi>.”

                           <p id="d145581e7282">Such were the scenes of domestic and social bliss,
                              such the delicious tranquillity, in which Mr. Henry
                              passed the first years of his retirement. Yet this retreat,
                              which so well deserved to have been considered
                              as sacred, was doomed in a few years to be disturbed
                              by the bickerings of political party.

                              parties had arisen in the United States, whose animosities
                              had been carried to an alarming height. The federalists,
                              who supported the measures of the new government,
                              throughout, were accused by their adversaries of
                              a disposition to strain the constructive powers of the

                              monarchy, at least; to which purpose, the assumption of
                              state debts, the establishment of the funding system,
                              and of the national bank, the alarming increase of the
                              public debt, the imposition of a heavy load of internal
                              taxes, the establishment of an army and a navy, with
                              all their consequences of favouritism and extensive
                              executive patronage, were alleged to have been introduced.
                              They were branded with the name of 
                              <hi id="d145581e7291" style="font-style: italic;">aristocrats</hi>,
                              a name of reproach borrowed from the parties in
                              France; and were charged with being inimical to the
                              cause of human liberty, as was said to be proven by
                              their hostility to the progress of the French revolution,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7294"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="395" data-tei-n="382"> </a></span>
                              as well as by the alarming character of those measures
                              which they were pushing forward in America. They
                              were suspected and accused of a preference for a government
                              of ranks and orders, and a secret love of titles
                              of nobility; of which it was said, one of their principal
                              leaders had furnished a decisive proof, so far as he was
                              concerned, by having proposed the introduction of titles
                              in the continental convention which had framed the
                              constitution. The party which urged these charges,
                              took the name of republicans and democrats; declared
                              themselves the friends of liberty and the people, and the
                              firm advocates of a government of the people by the
                              people. They were devoted, with enthusiasm, to the
                              cause of liberty in France; considered 
                              <hi id="d145581e7296" style="font-style: italic;">man</hi> as the only
                              title of nobility which ought to be admitted, and his
                              freedom and happiness as the sole objects of government;
                              this, they contended, was the principle on which
                              the American revolution had turned, that the great
                              objects of the revolution could be no otherwise attained,
                              than by a simple, pure, economical, and chaste administration
                              of the federal government; and by restricting
                              the several departments, under the new constitution, to
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7299" style="font-style: italic;">the express letter</hi> of the powers assigned to them by that
                              instrument.

                           <p id="d145581e7303">The federalists, on the other hand, denied and repelled,
                              with great acrimony and vehemence, the charges
                              which had been urged against them by their adversaries.
                              They contended that the measures complained
                              of, were warranted by the constitution, and were necessary
                              to give to the federal government, the effect which
                              was intended by its adoption. They insisted that 
                              <hi id="d145581e7305" style="font-style: italic;">they</hi>
                              were simply, the friends of

                              and in their turn, branded their adversaries with the

                              France, were for overturning all government, and
                              throwing every thing into anarchy and uproar, in the
                              hope of rising themselves to the top of the chaos. They
                              alleged that the opposition was formed of the dregs of
                              the American people, headed and goaded on by a few
                              designing men, and fermented into faction by the
                              revolutionary elements thrown among them, from abroad,
                              in the shape of French and Irish emigrants and convicts.
                              They insisted, that it was indispensably necessary
                              to the peace and order of the American nation,
                              that those foreign incendiaries should be driven out
                              from the land, and that the licentious fury of our own
                              populace also; should be bridled. Under this impression,
                              were passed those alien and sedition laws, which
                              are supposed to have put an end to the federal power
                              in America.

                           <p id="d145581e7320">It is not my function to decide between these parties;
                              nor do I feel myself qualified for such an office. I
                              have lived too near the times, and am conscious of having
                              been too strongly excited by the feelings of the day,
                              to place myself in the chair of the arbiter. It would,
                              indeed, be no difficult task to present, under the
                              engaging air of historic candour, the arguments on one
                              side, in an attitude so bold and commanding; and to
                              exhibit those on the other, under a form so faint and
                              shadowy, as to beguile the reader into the adoption of
                              my own opinions. But this would be unjust to the
                              opposite party, and a disingenuous abuse of the confidence
                              of the reader. Let us then, remit the question
                              to the historian of future ages; who, if the particular
                              memory of the past times shall not be lost in those
                              great events which seem preparing for the nation,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7322"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="397" data-tei-n="384"> </a></span>
                              will probably decide, that as in most family quarrels,
                              both parties have been somewhat, in the wrong.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7325">For my purpose, it is sufficient to state the rise and
                              existence of those parties, and the fact that their collision
                              had convulsed the whole society. Mr. Henry,
                              although removed from the immediate scene of contention,
                              was still an object of too much consequence to be
                              viewed with indifference. He had a weight of character
                              which gave to his opinions a preponderating influence
                              on every subject, and both parties were equally
                              anxious to gain him to their cause. His expressions
                              were watched with the most anxious attention, and it
                              was not long before an alarm of his defection from the
                              popular cause, was given. The first occasion of it
                              I discover, was the treaty of 1791 with Great Britain,
                              commonly known by the name of Jay's treaty.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7328">It will be remembered by the reader, that Mr. Henry
                              had objected to the constitution, on the ground that it
                              gave to the president and senate, the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7330" style="font-style: italic;">whole</hi> treaty-making
                              power. This construction of the instrument, was
                              not denied in the state convention; but on the contrary,
                              was at least impliedly admitted; and the provision was
                              vindicated on the ground that the power of treating
                              could be no where more safely and properly lodged.
                              When, therefore, the republican leaders in the house of
                              representatives, claimed a right to participate in the
                              ratification of Jay's treaty, Mr. Henry considered them
                              as inconsistent with themselves, and as departing from
                              their own construction of the constitution. This charge
                              and the defence, have both been made known to me,
                              by the following letter from Mr. Henry to his daughter,
                              Mrs. Aylett:

                                       sides in politics, I can only say they are not true.—
                                       I am too old to exchange my former opinions, which
                                       have grown up into fixed habits of thinking. True it
                                       is, I have condemned the conduct of our members in
                                       congress, because in refusing to raise money for the
                                       purposes of the British treaty, they in effect, would
                                       have surrendered our country bound, hand and foot, to
                                       the power of the British nation. This must have been
                                       the consequence, I think; but the reasons for thinking
                                       so, are too tedious to trouble you with. The treaty is,
                                       in my opinion, a very bad one indeed. But what must
                                       I think of those men, whom I myself warned of the
                                       danger of giving the power of making laws by means
                                       of treaty, to the president and senate, when I see these
                                       same men denying the existence of that power, which
                                       they insisted in our convention, ought properly to be
                                       exercised by the president and senate, and by none
                                       other? The policy of these men, both then and now,
                                       appears to me quite void of wisdom and foresight.
                                       These sentiments I did mention in conversation in
                                       Richmond, and perhaps others which I don't remember;
                                       but sure I am, my first principle is, that from the British
                                       we have every thing to dread, when opportunities of
                                       oppressing us shall offer.

                                       Who can have been so meanly employed, I know not—
                                       nor do I care; for I no longer consider myself as an
                                       actor on the stage of public life. It is time for me to
                                       retire; and I shall never more appear in a public
                                       character, unless some unlooked for circumstance shall
                                       demand from me a transient effort, not inconsistent with
                                       private life—in which I have determined to continue.
                                       I see with concern, our old commander in chief most
                                       abusively treated—nor are his long and great services
                                       remembered, as any apology for his mistakes in an office
                                       to which he was totally unaccustomed. If he, whose
                                       character as our leader during the whole war, was
                                       above all praise, is so roughly handled in his old age,
                                       what may be expected by men of the common standard
                                       of character? I ever wished he might keep himself
                                       clear of the office he bears, and its attendant difficulties
                                       —but I am sorry to see the gross abuse which is
                                       published of him. Thus, my dear daughter, have I
                                       pestered you with a long letter on politics, which is a
                                       subject little interesting to you, except as it may involve
                                       my reputation. I have long learned the little value
                                       which is to be placed on popularity, acquired by any
                                       other way than virtue; and I have also learned that
                                       it is often obtained by other means. The view which
                                       the rising greatness of our country presents to my eyes,
                                       is greatly tarnished by the general prevalence of deism;
                                       which with me, is but another name for vice and depravity.
                                       I am, however, much consoled by reflecting, that
                                       the religion of Christ, has from its first appearance in the
                                       world, been attacked in vain, by all the wits, philosophers,
                                       and wise ones, aided by every power of man,
                                       and its triumph has been complete. What is there in
                                       <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7362"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="400" data-tei-n="387"> </a></span>
                                       the wit, or wisdom of the present deistical writers or
                                       professors, that can compare them with Hume, Shaftsbury,
                                       Bolingbroke, and others? and yet these have been
                                       confuted, and their fame decaying; in so much that the
                                       puny efforts of Paine are thrown in, to prop their
                                       tottering fabrick, whose foundations cannot stand the test
                                       of time. Amongst other strange things said of me, I
                                       hear it is said by the deists that I am one of the number;
                                       and indeed, that some good people think I am no
                                       christian. This thought gives me much more pain,
                                       than the appellation of tory; because I think religion
                                       of infinitely higher importance than politics; and I find
                                       much cause to reproach myself, that I have lived so
                                       long, and have given no decided and public proofs of
                                       my being a christian. But, indeed, my dear child, this
                                       is a character which I prize far above all this world
                                       has or can boast. And amongst all the handsome
                                       things I hear said of you, what gives me the greatest
                                       pleasure is, to be told of your piety and steady virtue.
                                       Be assured there is not one tittle, as to disposition or
                                       character, in which my parental affection for you, would
                                       suffer a wish for your changing; and it flatters my pride
                                       to have you spoken of, as you are.
                                    </p>

                                       my wish is to pass the rest of my days, as much as may
                                       be, unobserved by the critics of the world, who would

                              is not wonderful therefore, that the rival parties

                              certain that the embassy to Spain was offered to him,

                              were extremely obnoxious in Virginia—those offers
                              were considered by the republicans, as so many strokes
                              of political flattery, addressed to the vanity of an old
                              man, and which had been but too successful in having
                              won him to the federal ranks. That he approved of the
                              alien and sedition laws, as good measures, is undeniable:
                              indeed, he was not a man who would deny any
                              opinion that he held: and, however honest might have
                              been his conviction, both of the constitutionality and

                              expediency of these measures, it is equally undeniable,
                              that his sentiments in relation to them, combined with
                              the above causes, by which those sentiments were suspected
                              of having been influenced, produced an extremely
                              unpropitious effect on his popularity in Virginia.

                           <p id="d145581e7438">The charge of apostacy however, implies a previous
                              commitment to the opposite side: but the evidence that
                              Mr. Henry ever stood committed to the democratic or
                              to any other party, (except the great American party of
                              liberty and republican government,) has not yet been
                              seen by the author of these sketches. At the time of
                              his retiremont, it is believed that the post-constitutional
                              parties were not distinctly marked. He had no opportunity
                              after they were so marked, of expressing his
                              opinion publicly in favour of the one side or the other.
                              It is highly probable, that his opinions did not coincide
                              throughout, with those of either side: and it would be
                              rather rash to infer, from his disapprobation of one or
                              more measures of the administration, or from his general
                              love of liberty, that he must of necessity have been attached
                              at first to the democratic side. Nor would it be more
                              correct to infer, from his having resisted the adoption of
                              the federal constitution, that he was therefore opposed to
                              the measures of those who administered it; for the converse
                              of this proposition, which must be equally true,
                              would have thrown many more into the federal ranks
                              than would have been willing to acknowledge the connexion.
                              Mr. Henry had moreover declared, as we have
                              seen, in the last speech which he made in the state
                              convention, in opposition to the constitution, that if it should
                              be adopted, he would be a peaceable citizen; that he
                              would not go to violence, but that he would seek the
                              correction of whatever he thought amiss, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7440" style="font-style: italic;">by quiet</hi>
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7443"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="404" data-tei-n="391"> </a></span>
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7445" style="font-style: italic;">means</hi>. Upon the whole, it would seem more liberal,
                              more consonant to the high character of Mr. Henry's
                              mind, with his time of life, and with that distant and
                              feeble connexion which he now considered himself as
                              holding with politics, and indeed with the world—to
                              believe that he looked, without passion or prejudice of
                              any kind, on the course of the administration, approving
                              or condemning, according to his own judgment, without
                              reference to the pleasure or opinions of either side: or
                              if we must suppose him under personal influence of any
                              kind, would it have been unpardonable in him, to have
                              been influenced by the opinions of that man, who had
                              ever stood first both in his judgment and affections, and
                              whom all America acknowledged as the father of his country?

                           <p id="d145581e7450">Other natural causes too, may be fairly considered
                              as having united their influence in producing this difference
                              of political sentiment, between Mr. Henry and the
                              majority of his state. In the year 1797, his health
                              began to decline, and continued to sink gradually to the
                              moment of his death.<a href="note93" class="ref-external" n="93" rend="sc"> *</a> He had now passed, through
                              a stormy life to his sixtieth year, and the vigour of his
                              mind, exhausted more by past toils than by years, began
                              to give way. Those energies which had enabled him
                              to brave the power of Great Britain, and to push forward
                              the glorious revolution which made us free, existed
                              no longer in their original force. The usual infirmities
                              of age and disease, began to press, sorely and heavily,
                              upon his sinking spirits. He was startled by that clash
                              of contending parties, which rang continually around
                              him, and invaded, with perpetually increasing horror,
                              the stillness of his retreat. His retirement cut him off,

                              almost entirely, from all communication with those
                              who were best able to explain the grounds, as well as
                              the character and measure of opposition to the offensive
                              measures, which was intended; and the spirit and
                              views of that opposition, were no doubt, aggravated to
                              him by report. Acting as those things did, on the mind of
                              an infirm old man; worn out by the toils and troubles of
                              the past revolution, and naturally wishing for repose;
                              alarmed too, and agonized by the hideous scenes of
                              that revolution which was then going on in France; and
                              tortured by the apprehension, that those scenes were
                              about to be acted over again, in his own country—it is
                              not surprising, that he was dismayed by the vehemence
                              of that political strife which then agitated the United
                              States; nor would it be surprising, if his solicitude to
                              allay the ferment and restore the peace of society,
                              should in some degree, have obscured the decisions of
                              his mind; and placed him, rather by his fears than his
                              judgment, in opposition to the forcible resistance, which
                              he had been erroneously led to consider, as meditated
                              by the democratic party. In a mind thus prepared, the
                              strong and animated resolutions of the Virginia assembly
                              in 1798, in relation to the alien and sedition laws,
                              conjured up the most frightful visions of civil war, disunion,
                              blood, and anarchy; and under the impulsc of these
                              phantoms, to make what 
                              <hi id="d145581e7463" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> considered a virtuous effort for

                              as a candidate for the house of delegates, at the spring
                              election of 1799.

                           <p id="d145581e7467">On the day of the election, as soon as he appeared
                              on the ground, he was surrounded by the admiring and
                              adoring crowd, and whithersoever he moved, the
                              concourse followed him. A preacher of the Baptist church,
                              whose piety was wounded by this homage paid to a
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7469"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="406" data-tei-n="393"> </a></span>
                              mortal, asked the people aloud, “Why they thus followed
                              Mr. Henry about?—Mr. Henry,” said he, “is
                              not a God!” “No,” said Mr. Henry, deeply affected
                              both by the scene and the remark; “no, indeed, my
                              friend; I am but a poor worm of the dust—as fleeting
                              and unsubstantial, as the shadow of the cloud that flies
                              over your fields, and is remembered no more.” The
                              tone with which this was uttered, and the look which
                              accompanied it, affected every heart, and silenced every
                              voice. Envy and opposition were disarmed by his
                              humility; the recollection of his past services rushed
                              upon every memory, and he “read his history” in their
                              swimming eyes.

                           <p id="d145581e7472">Before the polls were opened, he addressed the people
                              of the county to the following effect: “He told them
                              that the late proceedings of the Virginian assembly had
                              filled him with apprehensions and alarm; that they had
                              planted thorns upon his pillow; that they had drawn him
                              from that happy retirement which it had pleased a
                              bountiful Providence to bestow, and in which he had
                              hoped to pass, in quiet, the remainder of his days; that
                              the state had quitted the sphere in which she had been
                              placed by the constitution; and in daring to pronounce
                              upon the validity of federal laws, had gone out of her
                              jurisdiction, in a manner not warranted by any authority,
                              and in the highest degree alarming to every considerate
                              man; that such opposition on the part of Virginia, to
                              the acts of the general government, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7474" style="font-style: italic;">must</hi> beget their
                              enforcement by military power; that this would probably
                              produce civil war; civil war, foreign alliances; and that
                              foreign alliances, must necessarily end in subjugation
                              to the powers called in. He conjured the people to
                              pause and consider well, before they rushed into such a
                              desperate condition, from which there could be no
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7477"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="407" data-tei-n="394"> </a></span>
                              retreat. He painted to their imaginations, Washington,
                              at the head of a numerous and well appointed amy,
                              inflicting upon them military execution: ‘and where
                              (he asked) are our resources to meet such a conflict?
                              —Where is the citizen of America who will
                              dare to lift his hand against the father of his country?’
                              A drunken man in the crowd, threw up his
                              arm, and exclaimed that 'he dared to do it.’—‘No,’
                              answered Mr. Henry, rising aloft in all his majesty:
                              ‘
                              <hi id="d145581e7479" style="font-style: italic;">you dare not do it: in such a parricidal attempt, the
                                 steel would drop from your nerveless arm
                              </hi>!’ ‘The

                              gave to these words an energy on my mind, unequalled
                              by any thing that I have ever witnessed.’ Mr. Henry,
                              proceeding in his address to the people, asked, ‘whether
                              the county Charlotte would have any authority
                              to dispute an obedience to the laws of Virginia; and he
                              pronounced Virginia to be to the union, what the county
                              of Charlotte was to 
                              <hi id="d145581e7482" style="font-style: italic;">her</hi>. Having denied the right of a
                              state to decide upon the constitutionality of federal laws,
                              he added, that perhaps it might be necessary to say
                              something of the merits of the laws in question. His
                              private opinion was, that they were ‘
                              <hi id="d145581e7485" style="font-style: italic;">good</hi> and 
                              <hi id="d145581e7489" style="font-style: italic;">proper</hi>.’
                              But, whatever might be their merits, it belonged to the
                              people, who held the reins over the head of congress,
                              and to them alone, to say whether they were acceptable
                              or otherwise, to Virginians; and that this must be done
                              by way of petition. That congress were as much our
                              representatives as the assembly, and had as good a right
                              to our confidence. He had seen with regret, the unlimited
                              power over the purse and sword, consigned to the
                              general government; but that he had been overruled,
                              and it was now necessary to submit to the constitutional
                              exercise of that power. ‘If,’ said he, ‘I am asked
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7492"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="408" data-tei-n="395"> </a></span>
                              what is to be done, when a people feel themselves
                              intolerably oppressed, my answer is ready:—
                              <hi id="d145581e7494" style="font-style: italic;">Overturn the
                                 government
                              </hi>. But do not, I beseech you, carry matters
                              to this length, without provocation. Wait at least until
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7497" style="font-style: italic;">some</hi> infringement is made upon your rights, and which
                              cannot otherwise be redressed; for if ever you recur to
                              another change, you may bid adieu for ever to representative
                              government. You can never exchange the
                              present government, but for a monarch. If the administration
                              have done wrong, let us all go wrong together,
                              rather than split into factions, which must destroy that
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7500" style="font-style: italic;">union</hi> upon which our existence hangs. Let us preserve
                              our strength for the French, the English, the Germans,
                              or whoever else shall dare to invade our territory,
                              and not exhaust it in civil commotions and intestine
                              wars.’ He concluded, by declaring his design to exert
                              himself in the endeavour to allay the heart-burnings and
                              jealousies which had been fomented in the state legislature;
                              and he fervently prayed, if 
                              <hi id="d145581e7503" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> was deemed unworthy
                              to effect it, that it might be reserved to some
                              other and abler hand, to extend this blessing over the
                              community.”

                              the time by one of his hearers. “There was,” says
                              the writer, “an emphasis in his language, to which,
                              like the force of his articulation, and the commanding
                              expression of his eye, no representation 
                              <hi id="d145581e7512" style="font-style: italic;">can</hi> do justice;

                           <p id="d145581e7516">Such was the last effort of Mr. Henry's eloquence:
                              the power of the noon day sun was gone; but its setting
                              splendours were not less beautiful and touching.

                              After this speech, the polls were opened; and he was
                              elected by his usual commanding majority.
                           </p>

                              time before the period of the state elections, the most
                              formidable preparations were made to oppose him in
                              the assembly. Mr. Madison, (the late president of the
                              United States,) Mr. Giles of Amelia, Mr. Taylor of
                              Caroline, Mr. Nicholas of Albemarle, and a host of
                              young men of shining talents, from every part of the
                              state, were arrayed in the adverse rank, and commanded
                              a decided majority in the house. But heaven in its
                              mercy, saved him from the unequal conflict. The
                              disease which had been preying upon him for two
                              years, now hastened to its crisis; and on the sixth day
                              of June, 1799, this friend of liberty and of man, was no
                              more.

                              has passed away; and we again enjoy the calm
                              and sunshine of domestic peace. We are able now, to
                              see with other eyes, and to feel with far different hearts.
                              Who is there, that, looking back upon the part which
                              he bore in those scenes, can say that 
                              <hi id="d145581e7527" style="font-style: italic;">he</hi> was at no time

                              any vicious excess of feeling? The man who 
                              <hi id="d145581e7530" style="font-style: italic;">can</hi> say
                              this, is either very much to be pitied, or most exceedingly
                              to be envied. But whatever 
                              <hi id="d145581e7533" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> may be disposed
                              to say or to think of ourselves, there can be very little
                              doubt, that that Being, who is the searcher of hearts,
                              sees very much during that period, to be forgiven in us
                              all. It would indeed, be presumptuous in the extreme,
                              amid the universal admission which is made, of the
                              imperfection of human nature, in the happiest

                              <hi id="d145581e7541" style="font-style: italic;">was</hi> guilty of
                              a political aberration; but let all the peculiar circumstances
                              of his case, which have been enumerated, be
                              taken into the account; and let it be farther remembered
                              that if he did go astray, as the majority of the state
                              believe, he strayed in company with the father of his
                              country—and where is the heart so cold and thankless,
                              as to balance a mistake thus committed, against a
                              long life of such solid, splendid, and glorious utility?
                              Certainly not in Virginia—and it is to Virginians only,
                              that this appeal is made. The sentiments now so

                              and that that of the noblest gratitude has taken its place.

                              The time, as we have seen, was during that
                              paroxysm of displeasure against Mr. Henry, which even

                              ranked among the highest ornaments, and noblest
                              benefactors of his country. Had his lot been cast in the
                              republics of Greece or Rome, his name would have
                              been enrolled by some immortal pen, among the expellers
                              of tyrants and the champions of liberty: the
                              proudest monuments of national gratitude would have
                              risen to his honour, and handed down his memory to
                              future generations. As it is, his fame as yet, is left to

                              rest upon tradition, and on that short notice which
                              general history can take of him; while no memorial,
                              no slab even,

                              the patriot and the sage. May we not hope, that this
                              reproach upon the state, will soon be wiped away, and
                              that ample atonement will be made for our past neglect?

                           <p id="d145581e7582">MR. HENRY, by his two marriages, was the father of
                              fifteen children. By his first wife he had six; of whom
                              two only survived him; by his last, he had six sons and
                              three daughters; all of whom, together with their mother,
                              were living at his death.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7585">He had been fortunate during the latter part of his
                              life; and, chiefly by the means of judicious purchases
                              of lands, had left his family, large as it was, not only
                              independent, but rich.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7588">In his habits of living, he was remarkably temperate
                              and frugal. He seldom drank any thing but water;
                              and his table, though abundantly spread, was furnished
                              only with the most simple viands. Necessity had
                              imposed those habits upon him in the earlier part of his
                              life; and use, as well as reason, now made them his choice.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7592">His children were raised with little or no restraint.
                              He seems not to have thought very highly of early
                              education. It is indeed probable, that his own success,
                              which was attributable almost entirely to the natural
                              powers of his mind, had diminished the importance of
                              an extensive education in his view. But although they
                              were suffered to run wild for some years, and indeed,
                              committed to the sole guidance of nature, to a much
                              later period than usual, yet they were finally all well
                              educated; and not only by the reflected worth of their
                              father, but by their own merits, have always occupied
                              a most respectable station in society.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7595">Mr. Henry's conversation was remarkably pure and
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7597"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="414" data-tei-n="402"> </a></span>
                              chaste. He never swore. He was never heard to
                              take the name of his Maker in vain. He was a sincere
                              Christian, though after a form of his own; for he was
                              never attached to any particular religious society, and
                              never it is believed, communed with any church.
                              A friend who visited him, not long before his death,
                              found him engaged in reading the bible: “here,” said
                              he, holding it up, “is a book worth more than all the
                              other books that were ever printed: yet it is my
                              misfortune never to have found time to read it, with the
                              proper attention and feeling, till lately. I trust in the
                              mercy of heaven, that it is not yet too late.” He was
                              much pleased with Soame Jenyns' View of the internal
                              evidences of the christian religion; so much so, that
                              about the year 1790, he had an impression of it struck
                              at his own expense, and distributed among the people.
                              His other favourite works on the subject were Doddridge's
                              “Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul,”
                              and Butler's “Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed.”
                              This latter work, he used at one period of his life, to
                              style by way of pre-eminence, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7599" style="font-style: italic;">his bible</hi>. The selection
                              proves not only the piety of his temper, but the correctness
                              of his taste, and his relish for profound and
                              vigorous disquisition.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7603">His morals were strict. As a husband, a father, a
                              master, he had no superior. He was kind and hospitable
                              to the stranger, and most friendly and accommodating
                              to his neighbours. In his dealings with the world,
                              he was faithful to his promise, and punctual in his
                              contracts, to the utmost of his power.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7606">Yet we do not claim for him a total exemption from
                              the failures of humanity. Moral perfection is not the
                              property of man. The love of money is said to have
                              been one of Mr. Henry's strongest passions. In his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7608"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="415" data-tei-n="403"> </a></span>
                              desire for accumulation, he was charged with wringing
                              from the hands of his clients, and more particularly
                              those of the criminals whom he defended, fees rather
                              too exorbitant. He was censured too, for an attempt
                              to locate the shores of the Chesapeake, which had
                              theretofore been used as a public common, although
                              there was at that time, no law of the state which
                              protected them from location. In one of his earlier
                              purchases of land, he was blamed also for having availed
                              himself of the existing laws of the state, in paying for
                              it in the depreciated paper currency of the country; nor
                              was he free from censure on account of some participation
                              which he is said to have had in the profits of the
                              Yazoo trade. He was accused too, of having been
                              rather more vain of his wealth, towards the close of his
                              life, than became a man so great in other respects. Let
                              these things be admitted, and “let the man who is without
                              fault cast the first stone.” In mitigation of these
                              charges, if they be true, it ought to be considered that
                              Mr. Henry had been during the greater part of his life,
                              intolerably oppressed by poverty and all its distressing
                              train of consequences; that the family for which he
                              had to provide was very large; and that the bar, although
                              it has been called the road to honour, was not in those
                              days, the road to wealth. With these considerations
                              in view, charity may easily pardon him for having
                              considered only 
                              <hi id="d145581e7610" style="font-style: italic;">the legality</hi> of the means which he used to
                              acquire an independence; and she can easily excuse
                              him too, for having felt the success of his endeavours
                              a little more sensibly than might have been becoming.
                              He was certainly neither proud, or hard-hearted, or
                              penurious: if he was either, there can be no reliance
                              on human testimony; which represents him as being,
                              in his general intercourse with the world, not only
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7613"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="416" data-tei-n="404"> </a></span>
                              rigidly honest, but one of the kindest, gentlest, and
                              most indulgent of human beings.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7616">While we are on this ungrateful subject of moral
                              imperfection, the fidelity of history requires us to notice
                              another charge against Mr. Henry. His passion for
                              fame is said to have been too strong; he was accused of
                              a wish to monopolize the public favour; and under the
                              influence of this desire, to have felt no gratification in
                              the rising fame of certain conspicuous characters; to
                              have indulged himself in invidious and unmerited
                              remarks upon them, and to have been at the bottom of a
                              cabal, against one of the most eminent. If these things
                              were so—alas! poor human nature! It is certain that
                              these charges are very inconsistent with his general
                              character. So far from being naturally envious, and
                              disposed to keep back modest merit, one of the finest
                              traits in his character, was the parental tenderness
                              with which he took by the hand every young man of
                              merit, covered him with his aegis in the legislature, and
                              led him forward at the bar. In relation to his first great
                              rival in eloquence, Richard Henry Lee, he not only did
                              ample justice to him on every occasion, in public, but
                              defended his fame in private, with all the zeal of a
                              brother; as is demonstrated by an original correspondence
                              between those two eminent men, now in the
                              hands of the author. Of colonel Innis, his next great
                              rival, he entertained, and uniformly expressed, the most
                              exalted opinion; and in the convention of 1788, as will
                              be remembered, paid a compliment to his eloquence, at
                              once so splendid, so happy, and so just, that it will live
                              for ever. The debates of that convention, abound with
                              the most unequivocal and ardent declarations of his
                              respect, for the talents and virtues of the other eminent
                              gentlemen who were arrayed against him—Mr. Madison
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7618"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="417" data-tei-n="405"> </a></span>

                              great and overshadowing fame of Mr. Jefferson, never
                              extorted from him, in public at least, one invidious
                              remark; on the contrary, the name of that gentleman,
                              who was then in France, having been introduced into
                              the debates of the convention, for the purpose of
                              borrowing the weight of his opinion, Mr. Henry spoke of
                              him in the strongest and warmest terms, not only of

                           <p id="d145581e7630">The inordinate love of money and of fame are, certainly,
                              base and degrading passions. They have sometimes,
                              tarnished characters otherwise the most bright;
                              but they will find no advocate or apologist, in any
                              virtuous bosom. In relation to Mr. Henry, however; we
                              may be permitted to doubt whether the facts on which
                              these censures (so inconsistent with his general character)
                              are grounded, have not been misconceived; and
                              whether so much of them as is really true, may not
                              be fairly charged to the common account of human
                              imperfection.

                           <p id="d145581e7634">Mr. Henry's great intellectual defect was his indolence.
                              To this it was owing, that he never possessed
                              that admirable alertness and vigorous versatility of
                              mind, which turns promptly to every thing, attends to
                              every thing, arranges every thing, and by systematizing
                              its operations, despatches each in its proper time,
                              and place, and manner. To the same cause it is to be
                              ascribed, that he never possessed that patient drudgery,
                              and that ready, neat, copious, and masterly command of
                              details, which forms so essential a part of the duties both
                              of the statesman and the lawyer. Hence too, he did
                              not avail himself of the progress of science and literature,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7636"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="418" data-tei-n="406"> </a></span>
                              in his age. He had not, as he might have done,
                              amassed those ample stores of various, useful, and
                              curious knowledge, which are so naturally expected to
                              be found in a great man. His library (of which an
                              inventory has been furnished to the author) was extremely
                              small; composed not only of very few books, but those
                              too, commonly odd volumes. Of science and literature,
                              he knew little or nothing more than was occasionally
                              gleaned from conversation. It is not easy to conceive,
                              what a mind like his might have achieved in either, or
                              both of these walks, had it been properly trained at first,
                              or industriously occupied in those long intervals of
                              leisure which he threw away. One thing however, may
                              be safely pronounced; that had that mind of Herculean
                              strength, been either so trained, or so occupied, he
                              would have left behind him some written monument,
                              compared with which, even statues and pillars would
                              have been but the ephemeraeof a day. But he seems
                              to have been of Hobbes's opinion, who is reported to
                              have said of himself, “that if he had read as much as
                              other men, he should have been as ignorant as they
                              were.”<a href="note94" class="ref-external" n="94" rend="sc"> *</a> Mr. Henry's book was the great volume of
                              human nature. In this, he was more deeply read than
                              any of his countrymen. He knew 
                              <hi id="d145581e7641" style="font-style: italic;">men</hi> thoroughly;

                              was infinitely more remarkable for his ignorance

                              of men, than Mr. Henry was for that of books—
                              “What, Mr. Wormley,” said he, “still buying books?”
                              “Yes,” said Mr. Wormley, “I have just heard of a
                              new work, which I am extremely anxious to peruse.”
                              “Take my word for it,” said he, “Mr. Wormley, 
                              <hi id="d145581e7662" style="font-style: italic;">we
                                 are too old to read books: read men

                              Henry might have perused both, with infinite advantage
                              not only to himself, but to his country, and to the
                              world; and that he did not do it, may, it is believed,
                              be fairly ascribed, rather to the indolence
                              of his temper, than the deliberate decision of his judgment.

                              negligent of his dress: but this, it is apprehended,
                              applied rather to his habits in the country, than to his
                              appearance in public. At the bar of the general court,
                              he always appeared in a full suit of black cloth, or velvet,
                              and a tie wig, which was dressed and powdered in the
                              highest style of forensic fashion; in the winter season,
                              too, according to the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7674" style="font-style: italic;">costume</hi> of the day, he wore over
                              his other apparel, an ample cloak of scarlet cloth; and
                              thus attired, made a figure bordering on grandeur.
                              While he filled the executive chair, he is said to have
                              been justly attentive to his dress and appearance, unnecessary quotesnot
                              being disposed to afford the occasion of humiliating
                              comparisons between the past and present government.”

                           <p id="d145581e7678">He had long since too, laid aside the offensive rusticity
                              of his juvenile manners. His manners, indeed,
                              were still unostentatious, frank, and simple; but they
                              had all that natural ease and unaffected gracefulness
                              which distinguish the circles of the polite and well bred.
                              On occasions, too, where state and ceremony were

                              expected, there was no man who could act better his part.
                              I have had a description of Mr. Henry, entering, in the
                              full dress which I have mentioned, the hall of the delegates,
                              at whose bar he was about to appear as an advocate,
                              and saluting the house, all around, with a dignity
                              and even majesty, that would have done honour to the
                              most polished courtier in Europe. This, however, was
                              only on extraordinary occasions, when such a deportment
                              was expected, and was properly in its place. In
                              general, his manners were those of the plain Virginian
                              gentleman—kind—open—candid—and conciliating—
                              warm without insincerity, and polite without pomp—
                              neither chilling by his reserve, nor fatiguing by his
                              loquacity—but adapting himself, without an effort, to
                              the character of his company. “He would be pleased
                              and cheerful,” says a correspondent, “with persons
                              of any class of condition, vicious and abandoned persons
                              only excepted; he preferred those of character and
                              talents, but would be amused with any who could
                              contribute to his amusement.” He had himself, a vein of
                              pleasantry, which was extremely amusing, without
                              detracting from his dignity. His companions, although
                              perfectly at their ease with him, were never known to
                              treat him with degrading familiarities. Their love and
                              their respect for him equally forbade it. Nor had they
                              any dread of an assault upon their feelings; for there
                              was nothing cruel in his wit. The tomahawk and scalping
                              knife were no part of his colloquial apparatus. He
                              felt no pleasure in seeing the victim writhe under his
                              stroke. The benignity of his spirit could not have borne
                              such a sight, without torture. He found himself happiest,
                              in communicating happiness to others. His conversation
                              was instructive and delightful; stately where it
                              should be so, but in the general, easy, familiar, sprightly,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7682"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="421" data-tei-n="409"> </a></span>
                              and entertaining; always, however, good humoured, and
                              calculated to amuse without wounding.

                              the following anecdote has been furnished. Mr.
                              Henry, together with Mr. Richard H. Lee, and several
                              other conspicuous members of the assembly, were
                              invited to pass the evening and night, at the house of Mr.
                              Edmund Randolph, in the neighbourhood of Richmond.
                              Mr. Lee, who was as brilliant and copious in conversation
                              as in debate, had amused the company to a very late
                              hour, by descanting on the genius of Cervantes, particularly
                              as exhibited in his

                              dissertation had been continued rather too long: the
                              company began to yawn, when Mr. Henry, who had
                              observed it, although Mr. Lee had not, rose slowly from
                              his chair, and remarked, as he walked across the room,
                              that Don Quixote was certainly a most excellent work,
                              and most skillully adapted to the purpose of the author:
                              “but,” said he, “Mr. Lee, (stopping before him, with
                              a most significant archness of look,) you have overlooked,
                              in your eulogy, one of the finest things in the
                              book.” “What is 
                              <hi id="d145581e7693" style="font-style: italic;">that</hi>?” asked Mr. Lee. “It is,”
                              said Mr. Henry, “that divine exclamation of Sancho,
                              ‘
                              <hi id="d145581e7696" style="font-style: italic;">blessed be the man that first invented sleep: it covers
                                 one all over, like a cloak
                              </hi>.’ ” Mr. Lee took the hint;
                              and the company broke up in good humour.

                           <p id="d145581e7700">His quick and true discernment of characters, and
                              his prescience of political events, were very much
                              admired. The following examples of each, have been
                              furnished by Mr. Pope:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7703">Mr. Gallatin came to Virginia when a very young
                              man: he was obscure and unknown, and spoke the
                              English language so badly, that it was with difficulty he
                              could be understood. He was engaged in some agency
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7705"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="422" data-tei-n="410"> </a></span>
                              which made it necessary to present a petition to the
                              assembly, and endeavoured to interest the leading
                              members in its fate, by attempting to explain, out of doors,
                              its merits and justice. But they could not understand
                              him well enough to feel any interest either for him or
                              his petition. In this hopeless condition he waited on
                              Mr. Henry, and soon felt that he was in different
                              hands. Mr. Henry, on his part, was so delighted with
                              the interview, that he spoke of Mr. Gallatin every where
                              in raptures—“he declared him without hesitation or
                              doubt, to be the most sensible and best informed man
                              he had ever conversed with—
                              <hi id="d145581e7707" style="font-style: italic;">he is to be sure</hi>,” said he,
                              “
                              <hi id="d145581e7710" style="font-style: italic;">a most astonishing man</hi>!” The reader well knows
                              how eminently Mr. Gallatin has since fulfilled this
                              character; and considering the very disadvantageous
                              circumstances under which he was seen by Mr. Henry, it
                              is certainly a striking proof of the superior sagacity of
                              the observer.

                           <p id="d145581e7715">In relation to his political foresight, the following
                              anecdote is in Mr. Pope's own words: “In the year
                              1798, after Buonaparte had annihilated five Austrian
                              armies, and flushed with victory, was carrying away
                              every thing before him, I heard Mr. Henry in a public
                              company, observe (sharing his head after his impressive
                              manner)—It won't 
                              <hi id="d145581e7717" style="font-style: italic;">all</hi> do! the present generation
                              in France is so debased by a long despotism, they possess
                              so few of the virtues that constitute the life and
                              soul of republicanism, that they are incapable of forming
                              a correct and just estimate of 
                              <hi id="d145581e7720" style="font-style: italic;">rational</hi> liberty.
                              Their revolution will terminate differently from what
                              you expect—their state of anarchy will be succeeded
                              by despotism; and I should not be surprised, if 
                              <hi id="d145581e7723" style="font-style: italic;">the very
                                 man
                              </hi> at whose victories you now rejoice, should Caeesar-like,
                              subvert the liberties of his country. All who
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7726"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="423" data-tei-n="411"> </a></span>
                              know me,” continued Mr. Henry, “know that I am a
                              firm advocate for liberty and republicanism: I believe
                              I have given 
                              <hi id="d145581e7728" style="font-style: italic;">some</hi> evidences of this. I wish it may not
                              be so, but I am afraid the event will justify this prediction.”

                           <p id="d145581e7732">The following is the fullest description which the
                              author has been able to procure of Mr. Henry's person.
                              He was nearly six feet high; spare, and what may be
                              called raw-boned, with a slight stoop of the shoulders—
                              his complexion was dark, sun burnt, and sallow, without
                              any appearance of blood in his cheeks—his countenance
                              grave, thoughtful, penetrating, and strongly
                              marked with the lineaments of deep reflection—the
                              earnestness of his manner, united with an habitual
                              contraction or knitting of his brows, and those lines of
                              thought with which his face was profusely furrowed,
                              gave to his countenance at some times, the appearance of
                              severity—yet such was the power which he had over
                              its expression, that he could shake off from it in an
                              instant, all the sternness of winter, and robe it in the
                              brightest smiles of spring. His forehead was high and
                              straight; yet forming a sufficient angle with the lower
                              part of his face—his nose somewhat of the Roman stamp,
                              though like that which we see in the bust of Cicero,
                              it was rather long, than remarkable for its Caesarean
                              form—of the colour of his eyes, the accounts are
                              almost as various as those which we have of the colour
                              of the chamelion—they are said to have been blue,
                              grey, what Lavater calls green, hazel, brown, and
                              black—the fact seems to have been that they were of
                              a bluish grey, not large; and being deeply fixed in his
                              head, overhung by dark, long, and full eye-brows, and
                              farther shaded by lashes that were both long and black,
                              their apparent colour was as variable as the lights in
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7734"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="424" data-tei-n="412"> </a></span>
                              which they were seen—but all concur in saying that
                              they were, unquestionably the fullest features in his
                              face—brilliant—full of spirit, and capable of the most
                              rapidly shifting and powerful expression—at one time
                              piercing and terrible as those of Mars, and then again
                              soft and tender as those of pity herself—his cheeks
                              were hollow—his chin long, but well formed, and
                              rounded at the end, so as to form a proper counterpart
                              to the upper part of his face. “I find it difficult,”
                              says the correspondent from whom I have borrowed
                              this portrait, “to describe his mouth; in which there
                              was nothing remarkable, except when about to express
                              a modest dissent from some opinion on which he was
                              commenting—he then had a sort of half smile, in which
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7736" style="font-style: italic;">the want of conviction</hi> was 
                              <hi id="d145581e7739" style="font-style: italic;">perhaps</hi> more strongly
                              expressed, than the satirical emotion, which probably
                              prompted it. His manner and address to the court and
                              jury might be deemed the excess of humility, diffidence,
                              and modesty: If, as rarely happened, he had occasion
                              to answer any remark from the bench, it was impossible
                              for meekness herself, to assume a manner less
                              presumptuous —but in 
                              <hi id="d145581e7742" style="font-style: italic;">the smile</hi> of which I have been
                              speaking, you might anticipate the want of conviction,
                              expressed in his answer, at the moment that he submitted
                              to the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7745" style="font-style: italic;">superior wisdom</hi> of the court, with a grace that
                              would have done honour to Westminster hall. In his
                              reply to counsel, his remarks on the evidence, and on
                              the conduct of the parties, he preserved the same
                              distinguished deference and politeness, still accompanied
                              however by 
                              <hi id="d145581e7749" style="font-style: italic;">the never-failing index of this sceptical
                                 smile
                              </hi>, where the occasion prompted.” In short, his
                              features were manly, bold, and well proportioned, full
                              of intelligence, and adopting themselves intuitively to
                              every sentiment of his mind, and every feeling of his
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7752"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="425" data-tei-n="413"> </a></span>
                              heart. His voice was not remarkable for its sweetness;
                              but it was firm, of full volume, and rather melodious than
                              otherwise. Its charms consisted in the mellowness and
                              fulness of its note, the ease and variety of its inflections,
                              the distinctness of its articulation, the fine effect of its
                              emphasis, the felicity with which it attuned itself to
                              every emotion, and the vast compass which enabled it
                              to range through the whole empire of human passion
                              from the deep and tragic half whisper of horror, to the
                              wildest exclamation of overwhelming rage. In mild
                              persuasion, it was as soft and gentle as the zephyr of
                              spring; while in rousing his countrymen to arms, the
                              winter storm that roars along the troubled Baltic, was
                              not more awfully sublime. It was at all times perfectly
                              under his command; or rather, indeed, it seemed to
                              command itself, and to modulate its notes, most
                              happily to the sentiment he was uttering. It never
                              exceeded, or fell short of the occasion. There was none
                              of that long continued and deafening vociferation,
                              which always takes place when an ardent speaker has
                              lost possession of himself—no monotonous clangour, no
                              discordant shriek. Without being strained, it had that
                              body and enunciation which filled the most distant ear,
                              without distressing those which were nearest him: hence
                              it never became cracked or hoarse, even in his longest
                              speeches, but retained to the last, all its clearness and
                              fulness of intonation, all the delicacy of its inflection,
                              all the charms of its emphasis, and enchanting variety
                              of its cadence.

                           <p id="d145581e7755">His delivery was perfectly natural and well timed. It
                              has indeed been said, that on his first rising, there was
                              a species of 
                              <hi id="d145581e7757" style="font-style: italic;">sub-cantus</hi> very observable by a stranger
                              and rather disagreeable to him; but that in a very few

                              indeed, indispensable to the full effect of his peculiar
                              diction and conceptions. In point of time, he was
                              very happy: there was no slow and heavy dragging, no
                              quaint and measured drawling, with equidistant pace,
                              no stumbling and floundering, among the fractured
                              members of deranged and broken periods, no undignified
                              hurry and trepidation, no recalling and recasting of
                              sentences as he went along, no redaction of one word
                              and substitution of another not better, and none of
                              those affected bursts of almost inarticulate impetuosity,
                              which betray the rhetorician rather than display the
                              orator. On the contrary, ever self-collected, deliberate,
                              and dignified, he seemed to have looked through the
                              whole period before he commenced its delivery; and
                              hence his delivery was smooth, and firm, and well
                              accented; slow enough to take along with him the
                              dullest hearer, and yet so commanding, that the quick
                              had neither the power nor the disposition to get the
                              start of him. Thus he gave to every thought its full
                              and appropriate force; and to every image all its
                              radiance and beauty.

                           <p id="d145581e7763">No speaker ever understood better than Mr. Henry,
                              the true use and power of the 
                              <hi id="d145581e7765" style="font-style: italic;">pause</hi>; and no one ever
                              practised it with happier collect. His pauses were never
                              resorted to, for the purpose of investing an insignificant
                              thought with false importance; much less were they
                              ever resorted to as a 
                              <hi id="d145581e7768" style="font-style: italic;">finesse</hi>, to gain time for thinking.
                              The hearer was never disposed to ask, “why that
                              pause?” nor to measure its duration by a reference to
                              his watch. On the contrary, it always came, at the very
                              moment, which he would himself have wished it, in
                              order to weigh the striking and important thought which
                              had just been uttered; and the interval was always filled
                              by the speaker with a matchless energy of look, which
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7771"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="427" data-tei-n="415"> </a></span>
                              drove the thought home through the mind and through
                              the heart.

                           <p id="d145581e7774">His gesture, and this varying play of his features and
                              voice, were so excellent, so exquisite, that many have
                              referred his power as an orator principally to that cause;
                              yet this was all his own, and his gesture, particularly, of
                              so peculiar a cast, that it is said it could have become
                              no other man. I do not learn that it was very abundant;
                              for there was no trash about it, none of those
                              false motions to which undisciplined speakers are so
                              generally addicted; no chopping nor sawing of the air;
                              no thumping of the bar to express an earnestness,
                              which was much more powerfully, as well as more
                              elegantly, expressed by his eye and his countenance.
                              Whenever he moved his arm, or his hand, or even his
                              finger, or changed the position of his body, it was always
                              to some purpose; nothing was inefficient; every thing
                              told; every gesture, every attitude, every look, was
                              emphatic; all was animation, energy, and dignity. Its
                              great advantage consisted in this—that various, bold,
                              and original as it was, it never appeared to be
                              studied, affected, or theatrical, or “to overstep,” in
                              the smallest degree, “the modesty of nature:” for he
                              never made a gesture, or assumed an attitude, which
                              did not seem imperiously demanded by the occasion.
                              Every look, every motion, every pause, every start, was
                              completely filled and dilated by the thought which he
                              was uttering, and seemed indeed to form a part of the
                              thought itself. His action, however strong, was never
                              vehement. He was never seen rushing foward, shoulder
                              foremost, fury in his countenance, and frenzy in his
                              voice, as if to overturn the bar, and charge his audience
                              sword in hand. His judgment was too manly and too
                              solid, and his taste too true, to permit him to indulge in
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7776"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="428" data-tei-n="416"> </a></span>
                              any such extravagance. His good sense and his
                              self-possession never deserted him. In the loudest storm of
                              declamation, in the fiercest blaze of passion, there was
                              a dignity and temperance which gave it seeming. He
                              had the rare faculty of imparting to his hearers all the
                              excess of his own feelings, and all the violence and
                              tumult of his emotions, all the dauntless spirit of his
                              resolutions, and all the energy of his soul, without any
                              sacrifice of his own personal dignity, and without treating
                              his hearers otherwise than as rational beings. He
                              was not the orator of a day; and therefore sought not
                              to build his fame on the sandy basis of a false taste,
                              fostered, if not created, by himself. He spoke for
                              immortality; and therefore raised the pillars of his glory
                              on the only solid foundation—the rock of nature.

                           <p id="d145581e7779">So much has been already said, incidentally, of his
                              attainments, and the character of his mind, both as a
                              statesman and an orator, that little remains to be added
                              in a general way. As a statesman, the quality which
                              strikes us most is his political intrepidity: and yet it has
                              sometimes been objected to him, that he waited on
                              every occasion, to see which way the popular current
                              was setting, when he would artfully throw himself into
                              it, and seem to guide its course. Nothing can be more
                              incorrect: it would be easy to multiply proofs to refute
                              the charge;—but I shall content myself with a few
                              which are of general notoriety.

                           <p id="d145581e7783">1. The American revolution is universally admitted
                              to have begun in the upper circles of society. It turned
                              on principles too remote and abstruse for vulgar
                              apprehension or consideration. Had it depended on the
                              unenlightened mass of the community, no doubt can be
                              entertained at this day, that the tax imposed by parliament
                              would have been paid without a question. Since,
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7785"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="429" data-tei-n="417"> </a></span>
                              then, the upper circle of society did not take its impulse
                              from the people, the only remaining inquiry is,
                              who gave the revolutionary impulse to that circle itself?
                              It was unquestionably, Patrick Henry. This is affirmed
                              by Mr. Jefferson; it is demonstrated by the resistance
                              given to Mr. Henry's measures, by those who
                              were afterwards the staunchest friends of the revolution;
                              it is farther proved, by the sentiment before noticed,
                              with which doctor Franklin (who was then considered
                              as the first American statesman) dismissed Mr.
                              Ingersoll, on his departure from London; a sentiment,
                              which evinces beyond doubt, that doctor Franklin
                              considered resistance to the British power to be, at that
                              time, premature; and finally, this honour is assigned to
                              Mr. Henry, I perceive, by a late interesting historian of
                              Massachusetts, the only state which has ever pretended
                              to dispute the palm with Virginia.<a href="note96" class="ref-external" n="96" rend="sc"> *</a> On this great occasion
                              then, it is manifest, that he did not wait for the

                              alone, who by his single power, moved the mighty mass

                                    These are her words:—“The house of burgesses of Virginia, was the first
                                    who formally resolved against the encroachments of power, and the
                                    unwarrantable designs of the British parliament. The novelty of their procedure
                                    and the boldness of spirit that marked the resolutions of that assembly, at
                                    once astonished and disconcerted the officers of the crown, and the supporters
                                    of the measures of administration. These resolutions were ushered into
                                    the house, on the thirtieth of May, one thousand seven hundred and sixty five,
                                    by Patrick Henry, esq. a young gentleman of the law, till then unknown in
                                    political life. He was a man possessed of strong powers, much professional
                                    knowledge, and of such abilities as qualified him for the exigencies of the
                                    day. Fearless of the cry of

                                    he justified the measure, and supported the resolves, in a speech that did

                              was then young and obscure, and of course without
                              personal influence—that this step was the result of his own
                              solitary reflection, and that he was perfectly aware of
                              the personal danger which must attend it—we can
                              require nothing farther to satisfy us, that he was a bold,
                              original, independent politician, who thought for himself,
                              and pursued the dictates of his own judgment,

                              which still headed the revolution, were disposed to
                              acquiesce in the plunder of the magazine, and exerted
                              their utmost efforts to allay the ferment which it had
                              excited. They had, in fact, succeeded; and the people
                              were every where composed, save within the immediate
                              sphere of Mr. Henry's influence. The reader has already
                              seen, that it was he who on that occasion excited

                              actuated; that he placed himself at the head of an armed
                              band, which he had himself convened for the purpose;
                              and in spite of the entreaties and supplications of the
                              patriots at Williamsburg, and in defiance of the threats
                              of Dunmore and his myrmidons, pressed firmly and
                              intrepidly on, until the object of his expedition was

                              year, the old patriotic leaders were disposed still
                              to rely on the efficacy of petitions, memorials, and
                              remonstrances; it was Mr. Henry who proposed, and in

                              dictated by the people. The fact was, that at that day,
                              the people placed themselves in the hands of their more
                              enlightened friends; they never ventured to prescribe
                              either the time, the manner, or the measure of resistance;
                              and there can be no room for a candid doubt
                              that, but for the bold spirit and overpowering eloquence
                              of Patrick Henry, the people would have followed the
                              pacific counsels of Mr. Randolph, Mr. Nicholas, Mr.
                              Pendleton, Mr. Wythe, and other men of acknowledged
                              talents and virtue. It was Mr. Henry, therefore, who
                              led both the people and their former leaders. The latter,
                              indeed, came on so reluctantly

                              their motion, made ample amends thereafter, for their

                                    commenced the opposition to the stamp act, and the other obnoxious acts of
                                    the British parliament, before Mr. Henry made his appearance as a politician;
                                    they had commenced too, on the same grounds, and would, probably,

                              their head, opposed its adoption with all the powers of

                              variation of that conveyed by the opprobrious epithets of
                              demagogue and factious tribune, which we have seen
                              that his rivals long since sought to fasten upon him; and
                              there can be little doubt, that it proceeded from the
                              writhings and contortions of the same agonized envy.
                              That a poor young man, issuing from his native woods,
                              unknown, unfriended, and comparatively unlettered,
                              should have been able, by the mere force of unassisted
                              nature, to break to pieces the strong political confederacy
                              which then ruled the country, to annihilate all the arts

                              sagacity, the experience of age; and, by the sole strength
                              of his native genius, to throw into the shade all the hard
                              earned attainments of literature and science, was entirely
                              too humiliating to be borne in silence. It was necessary,
                              therefore, to resort to some solution of this phenomenon,
                              which should at once, reduce the honours of this
                              plebeian upstart, and soothe the wounded feelings of
                              those, whose pride he had brought down. Hence it
                              became fashionable, in the higher circles, to speak of
                              Mr. Henry as

                              gave himself the air of leading the people, when in
                              truth, he was merely following their own blind lead.

                              This cant has had its day, and its propagators. Truth
                              has set the subject to rights. Mr. Henry is alleged, by
                              those who had the best opportunities of knowing him,
                              to have been not inferior, either in public or in private
                              virtue, to any patriot of the revolution; and he was,
                              confessedly superior to them all, in that combination of
                              bold, hardy, adventurous, splendid, and solid qualifications,
                              which are so peculiarly fitted to revolutionary times.

                              This was to have been expected. We have seen that
                              he could not bear the labour of writing; nor, indeed, of
                              that long continued, coherent, and methodical writing
                              without which no successful composition, of any extent,
                              can be produced. He thought, indeed, a great deal,
                              but his thinking was too desultory and irregular to take
                              the form of composition. His mind had never been
                              disciplined to wait upon his pen—it still moved on—and
                              its prismatic beauties were as evanescent as they were
                              beautiful. His imagination “bodied forth the forms of
                              things” much more rapidly, than his unpractised pen
                              could “turn them to shapes;” and it is not improbable,
                              that his own observation of the difference between the
                              vigour with which he thought, and the comparative
                              decrepitude with which he wrote, disgusted him with his
                              first attempts, and prevented their repetition.

                              and looking directly at every subject, with the natural
                              eyes of his understanding, without using what has been

                              to him, both as a statesman and an orator: as a statesman,
                              it possibly exempted him from that common error
                              of scientific theorists, of forcing resemblances between
                              the present and some past historical era, and accommodating

                              their measures to this imaginary identity; by his
                              mode of considering subjects, no circumstance was
                              either sunk, or magnified, or distorted, in order to bend
                              the case to a fanciful hypothesis; nor, in deciding what
                              was proper to be done in America, did he look to see
                              what had been found expedient at Athens, or Rome.
                              On the contrary, knowing well the people with whom
                              he had to deal, of what they were capable, and what
                              was necessary to their happiness, how much they could
                              bear, and how much achieve, and looking immediately
                              at the subject, (whatever it might be,) with that piercing
                              vision, that solid judgment and ready resource, which
                              characterized his mind—he seemed to seize, in every
                              case, rather “luckily than laboriously,” the course
                              which of all others was surest of success. In short, this
                              habit made him an original, sound, and practical statesman,
                              instead of being a learned, dreaming, and visionary
                              theorist. Not that Mr. Henry was deficient in historical
                              knowledge; he had enough of it, for all the useful
                              purposes either of analogy or illustration; but he never
                              permitted it to intercept his proper view of a subject,
                              or to take the lead in suggesting what was fit to be
                              done. This he chose rather to derive from the nature
                              of the case itself, and the character of the people
                              among whom that case occurred.

                           <p id="d145581e7865">This habit of relying more on his own meditations
                              than on books, was also, perhaps, of service to him as
                              an orator: for by this course, he avoided the beaten
                              paths and roads of thought; and instead of exhibiting in
                              his speeches old ideas newly vamped up, and ancient
                              beauties tricked off in modern tinsel, his arguments,
                              sentiments, and figures, had all that freshness and
                              novelty which are so universally captivating.

                           <p id="d145581e7868">In what did his peculiar excellence as an orator consist?
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7870"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="435" data-tei-n="423"> </a></span>
                              in what consisted that unrivalled power of speaking,
                              which all who ever heard him admit him to have
                              possessed? The reader is already apprized, that the
                              author of these sketches never had the advantage of
                              hearing Mr. Henry, and that no entire speech of his
                              was ever extant, either in print or writing: hence, there
                              are no materials for minute and exact analysis. The
                              inquiry, however, is natural, and has been directed,
                              without success, to many of the most discriminating of
                              Mr. Henry's admirers. Their answers are as various
                              as the complexion of their own characters; each preferring
                              that property from which he had himself derived
                              the most enjoyment. Some ascribe his excellence
                              wholly to his manner; others, in great part, to the originality
                              and soundness of his matter. And among the
                              admirers, in both classes, there are not two who concur
                              in assigning the pre-eminence to the same quality.
                              Of his matter, one will admire the plainness and strength
                              of his reasoning; another, the concentrated spirit of his
                              aphorisms; a third, his wit; a fourth, his pathos; a fifth,
                              the intrinsic beauty of his imagination: so in regard to
                              his manner, one will place his excellence in his articulation
                              and emphasis; a second, in the magic power with
                              which he infused the tones of his voice into the nerves
                              of his hearers, and rivetted their attention. The truth,
                              therefore, probably is, that it was not in any single
                              charm, either of matter or manner, that we are to look
                              for the secret of his power; but that, like Pope's definition
                              of beauty, it was “the joint force and full result of all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e7873">If, however, we are to consider as really and entirely
                              his, those speeches which have been already given in
                              his name to the public, or are now prepared for them,
                              there can be no difficulty in deciding, that his power
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e7875"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="436" data-tei-n="424"> </a></span>
                              must have consisted principally in his delivery. We
                              know what extraordinary effects have been produced
                              by the mere manner of an orator, without any uncommon
                              weight or worth of matter.<a href="note98" class="ref-external" n="98" rend="sc"> *</a> We have the authority,
                              however, of those who heard the identical speeches
                              now professed to be given as his, for declaring, that they
                              are an extremely imperfect representation of them; and
                              their ability to correct them so frequently from memory,
                              establishes the fact, that it was not the charm of delivery
                              merely, which constituted the difference between the
                              report and the original. This is not the only instance,
                              in which a great orator has been injured, by imperfect
                              attempts to represent him: for (to say nothing of those
                              modern proofs, which will easily occur to the reader) we
                              are told, that the great Pericles himself met with a similar
                              fate.<a href="note99" class="ref-external" n="99" rend="sc">†</a> Candour and justice, however; require us
                              to repeat, that Mr. Robertson's reports are unquestionable,
                              in point of good faith; and that they are highly
                              valuable, on account of the accuracy and fidelity with
                              which they are believed to have preserved the substance
                              of the debates. It is with extreme regret that the author
                              has made a single comment to their disadvantage;
                              but justice to Mr. Henry has made it indispensable.

                              <hi id="d145581e7910" style="font-style: italic;">strong natural sense</hi>. His knowledge of human nature
                              was as we have seen, consummate. His wisdom was
                              that of observation, rather than of reading. His fancy,
                              although sufficiently pregnant to furnish supplies for
                              the occasion, was not so exuberant as to oppress him
                              with its productions. He was never guilty of the fault,
                              with which Corinna is said to have reproached her rival
                              Pindar, of pouring his vase of flowers, all at once upon
                              the ground; on the contrary, their beauty and their
                              excellence, were fully observed, from their rarity,
                              and the happiness with which they were distributed
                              through his speeches. His feelings were strong, yet
                              completely under his command; they rose up to the
                              occasion, but were never suffered to overflow it; his
                              language was often careless, sometimes incorrect; yet upon
                              the whole it was pure and perspicuous, giving out his
                              thoughts in full and clear proportion; free from affectation,
                              and frequently beautiful; strong without effort,
                              and adapted to the occasion; nervous in argument,
                              burning in passion, and capable of matching the loftiest
                              flights of his genius.

                              Henry's peculiar cast of eloquence, to state the points
                              in which he differed from other orators. Those which
                              distinguished him from Mr. Lee have been already
                              exhibited. Colonel Innis' manner was also very different.
                              
                              <hi id="d145581e7916" style="font-style: italic;">His</hi> habitual indolence followed him into debate; he

                              His eloquence was indeed, a mighty and a roaring torrent;

                              a striking resemblance to the eloquence of lord Chatham;
                              it was a short, but bold and most terrible assault—
                              a vehement, impetuous, and ovewhelming burst—a
                              magnificent meteor, which shot majestically across the
                              heavens, from pole to pole, and straight expired in a
                              glorious blaze.

                              general life, was never so in debate, where the occasion
                              called for exertion. He rose against the pressure, with
                              the most unconquerable perseverance. He held his
                              subject up in every light in which it could be placed;
                              yet, always with so much power, and so much beauty,
                              as never to weary his audience, but on the contrary to
                              delight them. He had more art than colonel Innis: he
                              appealed to every motive of interest—urged every
                              argument that could convince—pressed every theme of
                              persuasion—awakened every feeling, and roused every
                              passion to his aid. He had more variety too, in his
                              manner: sometimes he was very little above the tone of
                              conversation; at others, in the highest strain of epic
                              sublimity. His course was of longer continuance—his
                              flights better sustained, and more diversified, both in
                              their direction and velocity. He rose like the thunderbearer
                              of Jove, when he mounts on strong and untiring
                              wings, to sport in fearless majesty over the troubled
                              deep—now sweeping in immense and rapid circles—
                              then suddenly arresting his grand career, and hovering
                              aloft in tremulous and terrible suspense—at one instant,
                              plunged amid the foaming waves—at the next, re-ascending
                              on high, to play undaunted among the lightnings of
                              heaven, or soar towards the sun.

                              was loose, irregular; desultory—sometimes rough and

                              strength. In short, he was the ORATOR OF NATURE: and
                              such a one as nature might not blush to avow.

                           <p id="d145581e8313">I transmit, herewith, a letter from the honorable Mr. Hardy, covering a
                              memorial to congress from sundry inhabitants of Washington county, praying
                              the establishment of an independent state, to be bounded as is therein
                              expressed. The proposed limits in which a vast extent of country in which we
                              have numerous and very respectable settlements; which, in their growth, will
                              form an invaluable barrier between this country and those who, in the course
                              of events, may occupy the vast plains westward of the mountains, some of
                              whom may have views incompatible with our safety. Already the militia of
                              that part of the state, is among the most respectable we have; and by these
                              means it is, that the neighboring Indians are awed into professions of friendship.
                              But a circumstance has lately happened, which renders the possession
                              of that territory, at the present time, indispensable to the peace and safety of
                              Virginia: I mean the assumption of sovereign power by the western inhabitants
                              of North Carolina. If these people, who, without consulting their own
                              safety or any other authority known in the American constitution, have assumed
                              government, and while unallied to us, and under no engagements to
                              pursue the objects of the federal government, they shall be strengthened by
                              the accession of so great a part of our country, consequences fatal to our
                              repose will probably follow. It is to be observed, that the settlements of this
                              new society, stretch on to great extent in contact with ours, in Washington
                              county, and thereby expose our citizens to the contagion of that example,
                              which bids fair to destroy the peace of North Carolina.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e8316">In this state of things it is, that variety of informations have come to me,
                              stating that several persons, but especially col. Arthur Campble, have used
                              their utmost endeavours, and with some success, to persuade the citizens in
                              that quarter to break off from this commonwealth, and attach themselves to
                              the newly assumed government, or erect one, distinct from it. And in order
                              to effect this purpose, the equity and authority of the laws have been
                              arraigned, the collection of the taxes impeded, and our national character
                              impeached. But as I send you the several papers I have received on that subject,
                              I need not enlarge further than remark, that if this most important part
                              of our territory be lopped off, we lose that barrier for which our people have
                              long and often fought, that nursery of soldiers from which future armies may
                              be levied, and through which it will be almost impossible for our enemies to
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e8318"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="446" data-tei-n="vii"> </a></span>
                              penetrate: we shall aggrandize the new state, whose connexions, views, and
                              designs we know not, shall cease to be formidable to our savage neighbours, or
                              respectable to our western settlements, at present, and in future.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e8321">While these and many other matters were contemplated by the executive,
                              it is natural to suppose, the attempt for separation was discouraged, by every
                              lawful means; the chief of which was, displacing such of the field officers of
                              militia, in Washington county, as were active partizans for separation, in
                              order to prevent the weight of office being cast in the scale against this state:
                              to this end a proclamation was issued, declaring the militia law of the last
                              session, in force, in that county, and appointments of officers were made
                              agreeably to it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d145581e8324">I hope to be excused for expressing a wish, that the assembly, in deliberating
                              on this affair, will prefer lenient measures in order to reclaim our erring
                              fellow citizens. Their taxes have run into three years arrear, and, thereby,
                              grown to an amount beyond the ability of many to discharge, while the system
                              of our trade has been such, as to render their agriculture unproductive
                              of money; and I cannot but suppose that if, even the warmest supporters of
                              separation had seen the mischievous consequences of it, they would have
                              retracted; and condemned that intemperance in their own proceedings, which
                              opposition in sentiments is too apt to produce.

                              sent you. It will rest with the assembly to decide upon the means for
                              executing this laudable design, that reflects so much honour on that worthy
                              lady.

                           <p id="d145581e8330">By a resolution of the last assembly, the auditors were prevented from
                              liquidating the claims of the officers and soldiers, after the 1st day of May last.
                              Although the wisdom of such a measure must be admitted, yet several cases
                              have come to my knowledge where claims, founded upon the clearest principles
                              of justice, have been rejected by reason of that restriction: and when
                              I consider that the claimants will be found to consist, in considerable degree,
                              of widows, orphans, and those who have been taken prisoners, I am persuaded
                              the assembly will think that a rigorous adherence to the forementioned
                              resolution is improper, and that justice will be done to the claims of those
                              few, whose poverty, ignorance, or other misfortunes, prevented earlier
                              applications.

                              Although the post at Point of Fork has been long occupied, I cannot discover
                              the least trace of title to the ground vested in the public, or any previous
                              stipulation with the proprietor for the temporary possession of it. While the
                              assembly are considering of a proper satisfaction to the owner for the time
                              past, I trust provision will be made to secure a permanent repository for the
                              public arms and military stores, at that or some other place most proper for

                              that the assembly might, if they judged proper, determine to discontinue
                              them, or if they are retained, make suitable provision for their support:
                              hitherto, that has been defrayed out of the contingent fund. But the great

                              provide some other mode of support for them. The assembly will, no doubt,
                              observe in the course of their deliberations on the subject of revenue, that it
                              is necessary for the executive to commission the officers. The officer
                              commanding one of these boats has detected several persons attempting to evade
                              the payment of duty, and in compliance with the law, as he supposes, took
                              bonds for the payment of the penalties imposed for making false entries. But

                              mistake, in regard to the case of Josiah Philips, the following note
                              has been furnished to the author by the gentleman who was the chairman of

                              <p id="d145581e8408">“The case of Josiah Philips, I find strangely represented by Judge Tucker
                                 and Mr. Edmund Randolph, and very negligently vindicated by Mr. Henry.
                                 That case is personally known to me, because I was of the legislature at the
                                 time, was one of those consulted by Mr. Henry, and had my share in the
                                 passage of the bill. I never before saw the observations of those gentlemen,
                                 which you quote on this case, and will now, therefore, briefly make some
                                 strictures on them.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e8411">“Judge Tucker, instead of a definition of the functions of bills of attainder,
                                 has given a just diatribe against their abuse. The occasion and proper office
                                 of a bill of attainder is this; when a person charged with a crime, withdraws
                                 from justice, or resists it by force, either in his own or a foreign country, no
                                 other means of bringing him to trial or punishment being practicable, a special
                                 act is passed by the legislature, adapted to the particular case; this prescribes
                                 to him a sufficient term to appear and submit to a trial by his peers,
                                 declares that his refusal to appear shall be taken as a confession of guilt, as
                                 in the ordinary case of an offender at the bar refusing to plead, and pronounces
                                 the sentence which would have been rendered on his confession or
                                 conviction in a court of law. No doubt that these acts of attainder have been
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d145581e8413"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="449" data-tei-n="x"> </a></span>
                                 abused in England as instruments of vengeance by a successful over a
                                 defeated party. But what institution is insusceptible of abuse, in wicked hands?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e8416">“Again, the judge says, ‘the court refused to pass sentence of execution
                                 pursuant to the directions of the act.’ The court could not refuse this, because
                                 it was never proposed to them, and my authority for this assertion shall
                                 be presently given.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e8419">“For the perversion of a fact so intimately known to himself, Mr. Randolph
                                 can be excused only by our indulgence for orators who, pressed by a powerful
                                 adversary, lose sight, in the ardour of conflict, of the rigorous accuracies
                                 of fact and permit their imagination to distort and colour them to the views
                                 of the moment. He was attorney general at the time, and told me himself,
                                 the first time I saw him after the trial of Philips, that when taken and delivered
                                 up to justice, he had thought it best to make no use of the act of attainder,
                                 and to take no measure under it; that he had indicted him, at the common
                                 law, either for murder or rubbery, (I forget which, and whether for both,)
                                 that he was tried on this indictment in the ordinary way, found guilty by the
                                 jury, sentenced and executed under the common law; a course which every
                                 one approved, because the first object of the act of attainder was, to bring him
                                 to fair trial. Whether Mr. Randolph was right in this information to me, or,
                                 when in the debate with Mr. Henry, he represents this atrocious offender
                                 as sentenced and executed under the act of attainder, let the record of the
                                 case decide.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d145581e8422">“ ‘Without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses, without the
                                 privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf, he was sentenced to death, and
                                 afterwards actually executed.’ I appeal to the universe to produce one single
                                 instance, from the first establishment of government in this state to the
                                 present day, where, in a trial at bar, a criminal has been refused confrontation
                                 with his accusers and witnesses, or denied the privilege of calling for
                                 evidence in his behalf. Had it been done in this case, I would have asked of
                                 the attorney general, why he proposed or permitted it? But, without having
                                 seen the record, I will venture, on the character of our courts, to deny that it
                                 was done. But if Mr. Randolph meant, only, that Philips had not these
                                 advantages, on the passage of the bill of attainder, how idle to charge the
                                 legislature with omitting to confront the culprit with his witnesses, when he was
                                 standing out in arms, and in defiance of their authority; and their sentence
                                 was to take effect, only on his own refusal to come in and be confronted. We
                                 must either, therefore, consider this as a mere hyperbolism of imagination,
                                 in the heat of debate, or, what I should rather believe, a defective statement
                                 by the reporter of Mr. Randolph's argument. I suspect this last the rather,
                                 because this point in the charge of Mr. Randolph, is equally omitted in the
                                 defence of Mr. Henry. This gentleman must have known that Philips was
                                 tried and executed under the common law, and yet, according to this report,
                                 he rests his defence on a justification of the attainder only. But all who
                                 knew Mr. Henry, know that when at ease in argument, he was sometimes
                                 careless, not giving himself the trouble of ransacking either his memory or
                                 imagination for all the topics of his subject, or his audience that of hearing them.
                                 No man on earth knew better, when he had said enough for his hearers.

                                 day. I do not remember the fact, nor whether this was enforced on us by
                                 the urgency of the ravages of Philips, or of the time at which the bill was
                                 introduced. I have some idea it was at or near the close of the session. The
                                 journals, which I have not, will ascertain this fact.”
