                           Some of the reviewers expressed their surprise
                           that a West Indian wrote so well. I do not think
                           this was very complimentary, as the fact of being

                           no money cares; not that they do not sympathize
                           with their husbands in pecuniary difficulties, but
                           they have no purchases to make concerning eating
                           and drinking; they have no pestering cares, such as
                           bow down the spirit of an

                           buy good things, and yet keep within the bounds
                           of, perhaps, very restricted means; and the doub-

                           five-penny pieces, are speng in much the same way
                           or perhaps with less care than a school-girl spends
                           her pocket-money.

                           incite them to rebellion; and certainly there is
                           something very alarming in being in the midst
                           of a wild people, who, if they were to act with
                           energy, and skill, and courage, could soon make
                           themselves masters of the whole Island.

                              tion. The young man is suddenly plunged into
                              a new and different relationship with one whom
                              he is to call mother, and with whose tastes,
                              feelings, and habits he is altogether unacquainted.

                           keeps me aloof from mamma's surveillance, and so
                           she tries to make up for this by her quiet loving
                           watchfulness over my unthinking ways. Most
                           certain it is that she takes more care of me than of

                           to say to my Diary yesterday; mamma called me
                           away to give out the stores for her; she was not
                           feeling very well, and

                           jars some ginger. The syrup is good and clear,

                           And a very pretty sight it is in the early morning,
                           to watch the wherries, with their tilts and awnings,
                           setting off for

                           forwards every day in the week; but they start
                           early, that they may catch the remains of the land-
                           breeze, which is in their favour; and on their
                           return, they are generally blown forward with very
                           considerable force by the sea-breeze.

                           looked gravely and very tenderly at grandmamma.

                                       fell on each side of me, the bricks came rolling to my feet,
                                       but none hurt me. When I came to my lodgings, I found
                                       all things in the same order as when I left them, not a pic-

                           He says the wisdom of this world is foolishness
                           with God; that our greatest extent of knowledge,
                           in comparison with the wisdom which is from
                           above, is less than the lispings of a little child just
                           beginning to understand; and that the riches of this
                           world are as nothing, as long as we are rich in faith
                           and heirs of the kingdom of heaven.

                           a blessing in disguise; that he who ran might read

                           defence of the forest, shielding it from the en-

                           and a glory which it is impossible to describe. I

                           my stay with papa in the mountains, she noted my
                           sorrowful and dejected look, and this was too much
                           for me, and I burst into tears, and wept for some
                           time, with my head leaning on her bosom. I did
                           not breathe one word of all that had passed
                           between

                           They are 
                           <rs id="d17611e8445" type="properAdjective">African</rs> negroes and brothers. They
                           appear to be in a state of great ignorance; but not
                           understanding their language, we can scarecely
                           make out what they do know. They were slaves
                           in their own country, and there is not doubt they
                           will be far happier with us than with their 
                           <rs id="d17611e8448" type="properAdjective">African</rs>
                           task-masters; but this does not make slavery right.
                           They are not, however, as yet convinced that my
                           father will be kind to them; and it is quite affecting
                           to see how earnestly they look into our faces, as
                           if to read from them their future destiny. As I
                           write this, they are sitting in the front piazza,
                           eating 
                           <flora id="d17611e8451">neeseberries</flora>. Their names are

                           find our people can understand a little of what they

                           far as a negro can turn pale, which consists in
                           a kind of ashy grey look under their eyes and
                           round their mouth; for they have, it seems, a most
                           preposterous idea, that the white men buy them i
                           order to drink their blood, and they thought this
                           wine was blood, and that their tunr to be murdered
                           would soon come.

                           <persName id="d17611e8791">Hugh</persName> is more distant in his
                           manner to me than ever. Perhaps he regrets the
                           engagement. However, I must of necessity let
                           things remain as they are; for I have not courage
                           to speak to him about them. Yet he has a fervent,
                           thoughtful kind of manner towards me which I do
                           not think he exhibits towards anyone else.

                           peace seems gone. I know papa entered into the

                           <persName id="d17611e8797">Hugh</persName> out of affectionate concern

                           cold ways towards me. He loves his child, and
                           takes it as a thing of course that others should
                           love her too.

                           certainly seems shed upon them. I hope this state
                           of mind may last, for when I am very depressed, I

                           we cannot marvel at this, for when a girl makes a

                           depreciates her very much in the minds of rightly0
                           thinking persons, and casts a slur over her sense of

                           way of managing these little matters, and he soon
                           put her quite at her ease, by conversing freely and
                           pleasantly with her husband. In fact, he seemed
                           mightily pleased with him, and I feared lest he
                           should carry his acting too far, and so
