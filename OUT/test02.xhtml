                        told him I thought the author should explain his own songs but
                        I'm reconsidering. In fact, it's a very pleasant task. I know
                        how you feel about this, but I (your greatest advocate) want as
                        many as possible to understand as much as possible. Please
                        understand that mine is the difficult position more than
                        slightly analogous to the man who received Franz Kafka's dying

                        obliged to rush off to the publisher at his first chance. The
                        point is that you understanding the songs, me believing in their
                        worth, and Columbia recording them, is really not sufficient. So

                                 <title id="d46e175">Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</title>, written in
                                 	  April 1964, is a change of pace. The heightened intensity of
                                 	  
                                 <title id="d46e178">The Sounds of Silence</title> has given way here to a
                                 	  gentle mood, and the melody is once again a soft, smooth
                                 	  vehicle. It is a painting that sets a scene, sketches some
                                 	  details and quietly concludes.

                        I can. You know how [I] [we] feel--there may or may not be a
                        market for intellectuality, but there is your personal feel for
                        the material, and ours for the performance.
