                                 Kingsborough.

                              <p id="d44710e225">The jury had vanished from the semicircle of
                                 straight-backed chairs in the old court-house, the
                                 clerk had laid aside his pen along with his air of
                                 listless attention, and the judge was making his way
                                 through the straggling spectators to the sunken
                                 stone steps of the platform outside.  As the crowd
                                 in the doorway parted slightly, a breeze passed into
                                 the room, scattering the odours of bad tobacco and
                                 farm-stained clothing.  The sound of a cow-bell
                                 came through one of the small windows, from the
                                 green beyond, where a red-and-white cow was
                                 browsing among the buttercups.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e228">“A fine day, gentlemen,” said the judge, bowing
                                 to right and left.  “A fine day.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e231">He moved slowly, fanning himself absently with

                                 his white straw hat, pausing from time to time to
                                 exchange a word of greeting—secure in the inalienable
                                 affability of one who is not only a judge of man
                                 but a Bassett of Virginia.  From his classic head
                                 to his ill-fitting boots he upheld the traditions of his
                                 office and his race.
                              </p>

                                 he stopped to speak to a lawyer from a neighbouring
                                 county.  Then, as a clump of men scattered at
                                 his approach, he waved them together with a bland,
                                 benedictory gesture which descended alike upon the
                                 high and the low, upon the rector of the old church
                                 up the street, in his rusty black, and upon the red-haired,
                                 raw-boned farmer with his streaming brow.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e240">“Glad to see you out, sir,” he said to the one, and
                                 to the other, “How are you, Burr?  Time the crops
                                 were in the ground, isn't it?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e243">Burr mumbled a confused reply, wiping his neck
                                 laboriously on his red cotton handkerchief.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e246">“The corn's been planted goin' on six weeks,” he
                                 said more distinctly, ejecting his words between
                                 mouthfuls of tobacco juice as if they were pebbles
                                 which obstructed his speech.  “I al'ays stick to
                                 plantin' yo' corn when the hickory leaf's as big as
                                 a squirrel's ear.  If you don't, the luck's agin you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e249">“An' whar thar's growin' corn thar's a sight o'
                                 hoein',” put in an alert, nervous-looking countryman.
                                 “If I lay my hoe down for a spell, the weeds git so
                                 big I can't find the crop.”

                              <p id="d44710e252">Amos Burr nodded with slow emphasis: “I never
                                 see land take so natural to weeds nohow as mine
                                 do.” he said.  “When you raise peanuts you're raisin'
                                 trouble.”

                              <p id="d44710e258">He was a lean, overworked man, with knotted
                                 hands the colour of the soil he tilled and an inanely
                                 honest face, over which the freckles showed like
                                 splashes of mud freshly dried.  As he spoke he gave
                                 his blue jean trousers an abrupt hitch at the belt.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e261">“Dear me!  Dear me!” returned the judge with
                                 absent-minded, habitual friendliness, smiling his
                                 rich, beneficent smile.  Then, as he caught sight
                                 of a smaller red head beneath Burr's arm, he added:
                                 “You've a right-hand man coming on, I see.
                                 What's your name, my boy?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e264">The boy squirmed on his bare, brown feet and
                                 wriggled his head from beneath his father's arm.
                                 He did not answer, but he turned his bright eyes
                                 on the judge and flushed through all the freckles
                                 of his ugly little face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e267">“Nick—that is, Nicholas, sir,” replied the elder
                                 Burr with an apologetic cough, due to the insignificance
                                 of the subject.  “Yes, sir, he's leetle, but he's plum
                                 full of grit.  He can beat any nigger I ever seed at the
                                 plough.  He'd outplough me if he war a head taller.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e270">“That will mend,” remarked the lawyer from the
                                 neighbouring county with facetious intention.  “A
                                 boy and a beanstalk will grow, you know.  There's
                                 no helping it.”

                              <p id="d44710e274">“Oh, he'll be a man soon enough,” added the
                                 judge, his gaze passing over the large, red head to
                                 rest upon the small one, “and a farmer like his
                                 father before him, I suppose.”

                              <p id="d44710e285">He was leaning against the faded bricks of the old
                                 court-house, one sunburned hand playing nervously
                                 with the crumbling particles.  His honest little face
                                 was as red as his hair.

                              <p id="d44710e292">“Ah!” he exclaimed, and he looked at the child
                                 with his kindly eyes.  The boy was ugly, lean, and
                                 stunted in growth, browned by hot suns and
                                 powdered by the dust of country roads, but his eyes
                                 caught the gaze of the judge and held it.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e295">Above his head, on the brick wall, a board was
                                 nailed, bearing in black marking the name of the
                                 white-sand street which stretched like a chalk-drawn
                                 line from the grass-grown battlefields to the pale old
                                 buildings of King's College.  The street had been
                                 called in honour of a duke of Gloucester.  It was
                                 now “Main” Street, and nothing more, though it
                                 was still wide and white and placidly impressed by
                                 the slow passage of Kingsborough feet.  Beyond the
                                 court-house the breeze blew across the green,
                                 which was ablaze with buttercups.  Beneath the
                                 warm wind the yellow heads assumed the effect of
                                 a brilliant tangle, spreading over the unploughed
                                 common, running astray in the grass-lined ditch
                                 that bordered the walk, hiding beneath dusty-leaved
                                 plants in unsuspected hollows, and breaking out
                                 again under the horses' hoofs in the sandy street.

                                 laugh ran round the group.

                                 there was no surprise in his tone; it expressed rather
                                 the helplessness of paternity.

                                 the bricks.

                              <p id="d44710e316">“Stick to the soil, my boy,” he advised.  “Stick
                                 to the soil.  It is the best thing to do.  But if you
                                 choose the second best, and I can help you, I will
                                 —I will, upon my word—Ah!  General,” to a jovial-faced,
                                 wide-girthed gentleman in a brown linen coat,
                                 “I'm glad to see you in town.  Fine weather!”

                              <p id="d44710e322">He passed slowly along in the spring sunshine,
                                 his feet crunching upon the gravel, his straight
                                 shadow falling upon the white level between coarse
                                 fringes of wire-grass.  Far up the town, at the
                                 street's sudden end, where it was lost in diverging
                                 roads, there was visible, as through a film of bluish
                                 smoke, the verdigris-green foliage of King's College.
                                 Nearer at hand the solemn cruciform of the old
                                 church was steeped in shade, the high bell-tower
                                 dropping a veil of English ivy as it rose against the
                                 sky.  Through the rusty iron gate of the graveyard
                                 the marble slabs glimmered beneath submerging
                                 grasses, long, pale, tremulous like reeds.

                                 of the churchyard led on to the judge's own garden,
                                 a square enclosure, laid out in straight vegetable
                                 rows, marked off by variegated borders of flowering plants
                                 -  heartsease, foxglove, and the red-lidded eyes of
                                 scarlet poppies.  Beyond the feathery green of the
                                 asparagus bed there was a bush of flowering syringa,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e327"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="8"> </a></span>
                                 another at the beginning of the grass-trimmed walk,
                                 and yet another brushing the large white pillars of
                                 the square front porch—their slender sprays blown
                                 from sun to shade like fluttering streamers of
                                 cream-coloured ribbons.  On the other side there were
                                 lilacs, stately and leafy and bare of bloom, save for a
                                 few ashen-hued bunches lingering late amid the
                                 heavy foliage.  At the foot of the garden the wall
                                 was hidden in raspberry vines, weighty with ripening
                                 fruit.

                              <p id="d44710e331">The judge closed the gate after him and ascended
                                 the steps.  It was not until he had crossed the wide
                                 hall and opened the door of his study that he heard
                                 the patter of bare feet, and turned to find that the
                                 boy had followed him.

                              <p id="d44710e334">For an instant he regarded the child blankly; then
                                 his hospitality asserted itself, and he waved him
                                 courteously into the room.

                              <p id="d44710e340">He crossed to one of the tall windows, unfastening
                                 the heavy inside shutters, from which the white paint was
                                 fast peeling away.  As they fell back a breeze filled the
                                 room, and the ivory faces of microphylla roses stared
                                 across the deep window-seat.  The place was airy as a
                                 summer-house and odorous with the essence of roses
                                 distilled in the sunshine beyond.  On the high plastered
                                 walls, above the book-shelves, rows of bygone Bassetts
                                 looked down on their departed possessions—stately and
                                 severe in the artificial severity of periwigs and starched
                                 ruffles.  They looked down with immobile eyes and the
                                 placid monotony of past fashions, smiling always the
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e342"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="7" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span>
                                 same smile, staring always at the same spot of floor or
                                 furniture.
                              </p>

                                 touch.  They asserted themselves in the quaint
                                 curves of the rosewood chairs, in the blue patterns upon
                                 the willow bowls, and in the choice lavender of the old
                                 Wedgwood.  Their handiwork was visible in the laborious
                                 embroideries of the fire-screen near the empty grate, and
                                 the spinet in one unlighted corner still guarded their
                                 gay and amiable airs.

                                 mahogany, pushing aside the papers that littered its
                                 baize-covered lid.  In the half-gloom of the high-ceiled
                                 room his face assumed the look of a portrait in oils, and
                                 he seemed to have descended from his allotted square
                                 upon the plastered wall, to be but a boldly limned
                                 composite likeness of his race, awaiting the last touches
                                 and the gilded frame.

                                 preserving its unfailing courtesy.  He had not made an
                                 uncivil remark since the close of the war—a line of
                                 conduct resulting less from what he felt to be due to
                                 others than from what he believed to be becoming in
                                 himself.

                              <p id="d44710e358">The boy shifted on his bare feet.  In the
                                 old-timed setting of the furniture he was an alien—an
                                 anachronism—the intrusion of the hopelessly modern
                                 into the helplessly past.  His hair made a rich
                                 spot in the colourless atmosphere, and it seemed to
                                 focus the incoming light from the unshuttered window,
                                 leaving the background in denser shadow.

                                 The animation of his features jarred the serenity of
                                 the room.  His profile showed gnome-like against
                                 the nodding heads of the microphylla roses.

                              <p id="d44710e369">They were both silent.  The regular droning of the
                                 old clock sounded distinctly in the stillness.  The
                                 perfume of roses, mingling with the musty scent
                                 from the furniture, borrowed the quality of musk.

                                 the dirty knuckles of one fist into his eyes.

                                 boy Tom?”

                                 a wide-brimmed harvest hat, with a shoestring tied
                                 tightly round the crown.

                                 the boy.

                              <p id="d44710e457">“Dear me!” said the judge irritably, “dear me!”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e460">He frowned, his gaze skimming his well-filled
                                 shelves.  He regretted suddenly that he had spoken
                                 to the child at the court-house.  He would never be
                                 guilty of such an indiscretion again.  Of what could

                                 for food—money—his best piece of fluted Royal

                                 sun-scorched, honest-eyed little figure before him he
                                 saw his own boy—the single child of his young
                                 wife, who was lying beneath a marble slab in the
                                 churchyard.  Her face, mild and Madonna-like, glimmered
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e465"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span>
                                 against the pallid rose leaves in the deep window-seat.

                                 spelled out the names.

                                 had forgotten the boy, when he felt a touch upon his
                                 arm.

                                 the judge laughed he flushed nervously and turned
                                 towards the door.

                                 hall.  He saw the tracks of dust which the boy's feet
                                 left upon the smooth, bare floor, but he was not
                                 thinking of them.  Then, as the child went out upon
                                 the porch, he started up.

                                 Kingsborough dozed through the present to dream
                                 of the past and found the future a nightmare.  Had
                                 he been other than a stranger, he would, perhaps,
                                 have added that Kingsborough's proudest boast was
                                 that she had been and was not—a distinction giving
                                 her preëminence over certain cities whose charters
                                 were not received from royal grants—cities priding
                                 themselves not only upon a multiplicity of streets,
                                 but upon the more plebeian fact that the feet of
                                 their young men followed the offending thoroughfares
                                 to the undignified music of the march of progress.

                                 be nameless, it was otherwise with Kingsborough.
                                 Kingsborough was the same yesterday, to-day, and
                                 forever.  She who had feasted royal governors,
                                 staked and lost upon Colonial races, and exploded
                                 like an ignited powder-horn in the cause of
                                 American independence, was still superbly
                                 conscious of the honours which had been hers.  Her
                                 governors were no longer royal, nor did she feast
                                 them; her races were run by fleet-footed coloured
                                 urchins on the court-house green; her powder-magazine
                                 had evolved through differentiation from a stable
                                 into a church; but Kingsborough clung to her amiable
                                 habits.  Travellers still arrived at the landing stage
                                 some several miles distant and were driven over all but
                                 impassable roads to the town.  The eastern wall
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e510"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="14"> </a></span>
                                 of the court-house still bore the sign “England
                                 Street,” though the street had vanished beneath
                                 encroaching buttercups, and the implied loyalty had
                                 been found wanting.  Kingsborough juries still sat
                                 in their original semicircle, with their backs to the
                                 judge and their faces, presumably, to the law;
                                 Kingsborough farmers still marketed their small
                                 truck in the street called after the Duke of Gloucester;
                                 and Kingsborough cows still roamed at will over the
                                 vaults in the churchyard.  In time trivial changes
                                 would come to pass.  Tourists would arrive with the
                                 railroad; the powder-magazine would turn from a church
                                 into a museum; gardens would decay and ancient elms
                                 would fall, but the farmers and the cows would not be
                                 missed from their accustomed haunts.  On the hospitable
                                 thresholds of “general” stores battle-scarred veterans
                                 of the war between the States dealt in victorious
                                 reminiscences of vanquishment.  They had fought well, they had
                                 fallen silently, and they had risen without bitterness.
                                 For the people of Kingsborough had opened their
                                 doors to wounded foes while the battle raged
                                 through their streets, succouring while they resisted.
                                 They lived easily and they died hard, but when death
                                 came they met it, not in grim Puritanism, but with
                                 a laugh upon the lips.  They made a joy of life while
                                 it was possible, and when that ceased to be, they did
                                 the next best thing and made a friend of death.  Long
                                 ago theirs had been the first part in Virginia, and, as
                                 they still believed, theirs had been also the centre of
                                 all things.  Now the high places were laid low, and
                                 the greatness had passed as a trumpet that is blown.
                                 Kingsborough persisted still, but it persisted evasively,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e512"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="15"> </a></span>
                                 hovering, as it were, upon the outskirts of
                                 modern advancement.  And the outside world took
                                 note only when it made tours to historic strongholds,
                                 or sent those of itself that were adjudged insane to
                                 the hospitable shelter of the asylum upon the hill.

                              <p id="d44710e515">It was afternoon, and Kingsborough was asleep.
                                 Along the verdurous, gray lanes the houses seemed
                                 abandoned shuttered, filled with shade.  From the
                                 court-house green came the chime of cow-bells
                                 rising and falling in slow waves of sound.  A spotted
                                 calf stood bleating in the crooked footpath, which
                                 traversed diagonally the waste of buttercups like a
                                 white seam in a cloth of gold.  Against the arching
                                 sky rose the bell-tower of the grim old church, where
                                 the sparrows twittered in the melancholy gables and
                                 the startled face of the stationary clock stared
                                 blankly above the ivied walls.  Farther away, at the
                                 end of a wavering lane, slanted the shadow of the
                                 insane asylum.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e518">Across the green the houses were set in
                                 surrounding gardens like cards in bouquets of mixed
                                 blossoms.  They were of frame for the most part,
                                 with shingled roofs and small, square windows
                                 hidden beneath climbing roses.  On one of the long
                                 verandas a sleeping girl lay in a hammock, a gray
                                 cat at her feet.  No sound came from the house
                                 behind her, but a breeze blew through the dim hall,
                                 fluttering the folds of her dress.  Beyond the
                                 adjoining garden a lady in mourning entered a gate
                                 where honeysuckle grew, and above, on the low-dormered
                                 roof, a white pigeon sat preening its feathers.  Up
                                 the main street, where a few sunken bricks of a
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e520"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="14" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span>
                                 vanished pavement were still visible, an old negro
                                 woman, sitting on the stone before her cabin, lighted
                                 her replenished pipe with a taper, and leaned back,
                                 smoking, in the doorway, her scarlet handkerchief
                                 making a spot of colour on the dull background.

                                 upon his porch, a smile of indecision on his face and
                                 his hat in his hand.  Pausing upon the topmost step,
                                 he cast an uncertain glance sideways at the walk
                                 leading past the church, and then looked straight
                                 ahead through the avenue of maples, which began at
                                 the smaller green facing the ancient site of the
                                 governor's palace and skirted the length of the larger
                                 one, which took its name from the courthouse.  At
                                 last he descended the steps with his leisurely tread,
                                 turning at the gate to throw a remonstrance to an old
                                 negro whose black face was framed in the library
                                 window.

                                 a flash of laughter.

                              <p id="d44710e575">The judge shook his stick playfully.</p>

                                 we should have taken more than the catechism at
                                 your bidding, my dear.  When your father was
                                 courting your mother—and she was like you, though
                                 she hadn't your eyes, or your face, for that
                                 matter—he went into her Bible class, though he
                                 was at least five and twenty and the others were
                                 small boys under ten.  She was a sad flirt, and she
                                 led him a dance.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e582">“He liked it,” said the girl.  “But, if you will give
                                 my message to Tom, I won't come in.  I am looking
                                 for Dudley Webb, and I see his mother at her gate.
                                 Good-bye!  Be sure and tell Tom to come Sunday.”
                              </p>

                                 recrossed the street.  The judge watched her until
                                 the flutter of her white dress vanished down the
                                 lane of maples; then he turned to speak to the
                                 occupants of a carriage that had drawn up to the
                                 sidewalk.

                                 rusty springs.  It was drawn by an ill-matched pair
                                 of horses and driven by a lame coloured boy, who
                                 carried a peeled hickory branch for a whip.

                                 or eight years, with a puppy of the pointer breed in
                                 her arms, and “How are you, Sampson?” to the

                                 wiping his large face with a large pocket
                                 handkerchief.  “Keep her!  If I were thirty years

                              <p id="d44710e606">The little girl looked up gravely from the corner
                                 of the seat, tossing her short, dark plait from her
                                 shoulder.  “What would you do with her, papa?”
                                 she asked.  “We've got no place to put her at
                                 home.”

                                 laughed till his wide girth shook like a bag of meal.

                                 Bless your heart, she wouldn't look at me if I
                                 asked her—”

                                 her eyes upon her father's jovial face.

                                 rich with the blending of negro intonations.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e622">The general shook again until the carriage

                                 creaked on its rusty springs, and the coloured boy,
                                 Sampson, let the reins fall and joined in the hilarity.
                              </p>

                                 exclaimed the general delightedly, stooping to
                                 recover the brown linen lap robe which had slipped
                                 from his knees.  “She's as jealous as if I were
                                 twenty and had a score of sweethearts.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e630">The little girl did not reply, but she flushed angrily.
                                 “Don't, precious,” she said to the puppy, who was
                                 licking her cheek with his warm, red tongue.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e633">“What have you named him, Eugie?” asked the
                                 judge, changing the subject with that gracious tact
                                 which was mindful of the least emergency.  “He is
                                 nicely marked, I see.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e636">“I call him Jim,” replied Eugenia.  She spoke
                                 gravely, and the gravity contrasted oddly with the
                                 animation of her features.  “But his real name is
                                 James Burwell Battle.  Bernard and I christened him
                                 in the spring-house—so he'll go to heaven.”
                              </p>

                                 explained the general, who laughed whenever his
                                 daughter spoke, as if the fact of her talking at all
                                 was a source of amazement to him, “and she hasn't
                                 let go of him since she got him.  By the way,
                                 Judge, you have a first-rate garden spot.  I hear
                                 your asparagus is the finest in town.  Ours is very
                                 poor this year.  I must have a new bed made before
                                 next season.  Ah, what is it, daughter?”
                              </p>

                                 carriage jolted along the green and disappeared
                                 behind the glazed brick walls of the church.

                                 Juliet Burwell returned to his face, and his features
                                 softened from their usual chilly serenity.

                                 the bars he saw little Nicholas Burr lying at full

                                 heavy gate with a metallic clang.  Nicholas lay on
                                 the marble slab, but the book slipped from his hands,
                                 and he gazed straight before him at the oriel
                                 window, where the ivy was tremulous with the
                                 shining bodies and clamorous voices of nesting
                                 sparrows.  They darted swiftly from gable to gable,
                                 filling the air with shrill sounds of discord, and
                                 endowing with animation the inanimate pile,
                                 wrapping the dead bricks in a living shroud.

                              <p id="d44710e734">On the other side swept the long, colourless
                                 grasses, rippling in faint waves like a still lake that
                                 reflects the sunshine and swaying lightly beneath
                                 myriads of gauzy-winged bees that flashed with a
                                 droning noise from blade to blade, to find rest in the
                                 yellow hearts of the damask roses.  Across the white vaults
                                 and the low-lying marble slabs innumerable shadows
                                 chased, and from above the gnarled old locust trees
                                 swept a fringe of vivid green, the slender

                                 blossoms hanging in tassels from the branches'
                                 ends, and filling the air with a soft and ceaseless
                                 rain of fragrant petals.  Pale as the ghosts of dead
                                 leaves, they fell always, fluttering night and day
                                 from the twisted boughs, settling in creamy flakes
                                 upon the bending grasses, and outlining in delicate
                                 tracery the epitaphs upon the discoloured marbles.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e740">Nicholas lay with wide-open eyes, looking up at
                                 the oriel window where the sparrows twittered.  On
                                 a near vault a catbird poised for an instant, surveying
                                 him with bright, distrustful eyes.  Then, with an
                                 impetuous flutter of slate-gray wings, it fled to the
                                 poisonous oak on the far brick wall.  A red-and-white
                                 cow, passing along the lane outside, stopped before
                                 the closed gate, and stood philosophically chewing the
                                 cud as she looked within through impeding bars.  From
                                 the judge's garden came the faint sound of a negro
                                 voice as the old gardener weeded the vegetables.
                                 Nicholas rolled over again and faced the outstretched
                                 wings of the noseless angel on the nearest tombstone.
                                 The loss of the nose had distorted the marble smile
                                 into a grimace, which gave a leer to the remaining
                                 features.  As the boy looked at it he laughed suddenly,
                                 and his voice startled him amid the droning of bees.
                                 Then he sat up and glanced at his briar-scratched
                                 feet stretched upon the slab, and laughed
                                 again for the sheer joy of discord.

                                 end at King's College, and turned into one of the
                                 diverging ways which skirted the whitewashed
                                 plank fence of the college grounds, and led to what
                                 was known in the neighbourhood as the Old Stage
                                 Road.  Passing a straggling group of negro cabins, it
                                 stretched, naked, bleached, and barren, for a good
                                 half-mile, dividing with its sandy length the low-lying
                                 fields, which were sown on the one side in a sparse
                                 crop of grain and on the other in the rich leaves and
                                 round pink heads of ripening clover.  At the end of
                                 the half-mile the road ascended a slight elevation,
                                 and the character of the soil changed abruptly into
                                 clay of vivid red, which, extending a dozen yards up
                                 the rain-washed hillside, appeared, in a general view
                                 of the landscape, like the scarlet tongue protruding
                                 from the silvery body of a serpent.

                                 standing a gloomy advance guard of the shadows of
                                 the night.  At its foot the newer green of the late
                                 spring foliage took a frivolous aspect, presenting the
                                 effect of deep-tinted foam breaking against the
                                 impenetrable mass of darkness.

                                 like a stealthy shadow of the leaves of the

                                 aimed it at the slimy little body, but his throw erred,
                                 and the missile fell harmlessly into the wheat field
                                 beyond, startling a blackbird with scarlet marks,
                                 which soared suddenly above the bearded grain and
                                 vanished, with a tremulous cry and a flame of
                                 outstretched wings, into the distant wood.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e767">The sun had gone down behind the pines and a
                                 warm mist steamed up from the cooling earth,
                                 condensing into heavy dew on the dusty leaves the
                                 plants in the ditch.  Above the lowering pines the
                                 horizon burned to a deep scarlet, like an inverted
                                 brazier at red heat, and one gigantic tree, rising
                                 beyond the jagged line of the forest, was silhouetted
                                 sharply against the enkindled clouds.  Suddenly, from
                                 the shadows of the long road, a voice rose
                                 plaintively.  It was rich and deep and colourific, and
                                 it seemed to hover close to the warmth of the earth,
                                 weighed down by its animal melody.  It had mingled
                                 so subtly with the stillness that it was as much a
                                 part of nature as the cry of a whip-poor-will beyond
                                 the thicket or the sunset in the pine-guarded west.
                                 At first it came faintly, and the words were lost, but
                                 as Nicholas gained upon the singer he caught more
                                 clearly the air and the song.

                                 moment, saw the stooping figure of an old negro
                                 toiling up the red clay hillside, a staff in his hand and
                                 a bag of meal on his shoulder.  In the vivid light of
                                 the sunset his stature was exaggerated in size,
                                 giving him an appearance at once picturesque and
                                 pathetic—softening his rugged outline and
                                 magnifying the distortion of age.

                                 his song.

                                 the possibility of pointing out his place.

                                 them, gaining upon them from the direction of
                                 Kingsborough, and they fell to one side of the road,
                                 leaving room for the horses to pass.  It was the
                                 Battle carriage, rolling heavily on its aged wheels
                                 and creaking beneath the general's weight.

                                 The general responded good-naturedly, and the
                                 carriage passed on, but, before turning into the
                                 branch road a few yards ahead, it came to a
                                 standstill, and the bright, decisive voice of the little
                                 girl floated back.

                                 and, with a flick of the peeled hickory whip, the

                                 disappeared, scattering a whirl of mud drops as it
                                 splashed through the shallow puddles which lingered
                                 in the dryest season beneath the heavy shade of the
                                 wood.

                              <p id="d44710e945">Nicholas turned into the branch road also, for the
                                 poor lands of his father adjoined the slightly richer
                                 ones of the Battles.  He felt tired and a little lonely,
                                 and he wished suddenly that a friendly cart would
                                 come along in which he might ride the remainder of
                                 the way.  Between the densely wooded thicket on
                                 either side, the road looked dark and solemn.  It was
                                 spread with a rotting carpet of last year's leaves,
                                 soft and damp under foot, and polished into shining
                                 tracks in the ruts left by passing wheels.  Through
                                 the dusk the ghostly bodies of beech trees stood out
                                 distinctly from the surrounding wood, as if marked
                                 by a silver light falling from the topmost branches.
                                 The hoarse, grating notes of jar-flies intensified the
                                 stillness.

                              <p id="d44710e948">Nicholas went on steadily, spurred by
                                 superstitious terror of the silence.  He remembered
                                 that Uncle Ish had said there were no “ha'nts”
                                 along this road, but the assurance was barren of
                                 comfort Old Uncle Dan'l Mule had certainly seen a
                                 figure in a white sheet rise up out of that decayed
                                 oak stump in the hollow, for he had sworn to it in the
                                 boy's presence in Aunt Rhody Sand's cabin the night
                                 of her daughter Viny's wedding.  As for Viny's
                                 husband Saul, he had declared that one night after
                                 ten o'clock, when he was coming through this wood,
                                 the “booger-boos” had got after him and chased
                                 him home.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e953">At the end of the wood the road came out upon
                                 the open again, and in the distance Nicholas could
                                 see, like burnished squares, the windows of his
                                 father's house.  Between the thicket and the house
                                 there was a long stretch of clearing, which had been
                                 once planted in corn, and now supported a headless
                                 army of dry stubble, amid a dull-brown waste of
                                 brooms-edge.  The last pale vestige of the afterglow,
                                 visible across the level country, swept the arid field
                                 and softened the harsh outlines of the landscape.  It
                                 was barren soil, whose strength had been exhausted
                                 long since by years of production without returns,
                                 tilled by hands that had forced without fertilizing.
                                 There was now grim pathos in its absolute sterility,
                                 telling as it did of long-gone yields of grain and
                                 historic harvests.

                                 the pasture gate on the opposite side of the road,
                                 when he heard the shrill sound of a voice from the
                                 direction of the house.

                                 cow-pen he discerned the small figure and green
                                 cotton frock of his half-sister, Sarah Jane, who was
                                 shouting through her hollowed palms to increase the
                                 volume of sound.

                                 the remainder of the road and swung himself over
                                 the little gate which led into the small square yard

                                 supper, and near a row of pointed chicken coops
                                 the three younger children were “shooing” up the
                                 tiny yellow broods.  The yard was unkempt and ugly
                                 run wild in straggling ailanthus shoots and littered
                                 with chips from the wood-pile.

                                 walnut tint.  At her back stood Sarah Jane with a
                                 plate of corn bread in one hand and a glass pitcher
                                 containing buttermilk in the other.  She was a slight,
                                 flaxen-haired child, with wizened features and sore,
                                 red eyelids.

                                 chronic facial neuralgia, which gave her an irritable

                                 several years Nicholas had never seen her without
                                 a large cotton handkerchief bound tightly about her
                                 face.  She had been the boy's aunt before she
                                 married his father, and her affection for him was
                                 proved by her allowing no one to harry him except
                                 herself.

                                 table while Sarah Jane went to the door to call her

                                 himself and stole softly down from the attic, the frail
                                 stairway creaking beneath his tread.  As he was
                                 unfastening the kitchen door, which led out upon a
                                 rough plank platform called the “back porch,”
                                 Marthy Burr stuck her head in from the adjoining
                                 room where she slept, and called his name in a
                                 high-pitched, querulous voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1071">“Is that you, Nick?” she asked.  “I declar, I'd
                                 jest dropped off to sleep when you woke me comin'
                                 down stairs.  I never could abide tip-toein', nohow.  I
                                 don't see how 'tis that I can't get no rest 'thout
                                 bein' roused up, when your pa can turn right over
                                 and sleep through thunder.  Whar you goin' now?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1074">Nicholas stopped and held a whispered colloquy
                                 with her from the back porch.  “I'm goin' to drag
                                 the land some 'fore pa gets up,” he answered.  “Then
                                 I'm goin' in to town.  You know he said I might.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1077">His stepmother shook her bandaged head
                                 peevishly and stood holding the collar of her
                                 unbleached cotton gown.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1081">“Oh, I reckon so,” she responded.  “I was
                                 thinkin' 'bout goin' in myself and hevin' my tooth out,
                                 but I s'pose I can wait on you.  The Lord knows I'm
                                 used to waitin'.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1084">Nicholas looked at her in perplexity, his arm resting
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1086"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="36" data-tei-n="38"> </a></span>
                                 on the little shelf outside, which supported the
                                 wooden water bucket and the long-handled gourd.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1089">“You can go when I come back,” he said at last,
                                 adding with an effort, “or, if it's so bad, I can stay
                                 at home.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1092">But, having asserted her supremacy over his
                                 inclinations, Marthy Burr relented.  “Oh, I don't
                                 know as I'll go in to-day,” she returned.  “I ain't got
                                 enough teeth left now to chew on, an' I don't
                                 believe it's the teeth, nohow.  It's the gums—”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1095">She retreated into the room, whence the shrill
                                 voice of Sairy Jane inquired:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1098">“Air you up, ma?  Why, 'tain't day!”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1102">Nicholas closed the door and went out upon the
                                 porch.  The yard looked deserted and desolated,
                                 giving him a sudden realisation of his own littleness
                                 and the immensity of the hour.  It was as if the
                                 wheels of time had stopped in the dim promise of
                                 things unfulfilled.  A broken scythe lay to one side
                                 amid the straggling ailanthus shoots; near the
                                 woodpile there was a wheelbarrow half filled with
                                 chips, and at a little distance the axe was poised
                                 upon a rotten log.  From the small coops beside the
                                 hen-house came an anxious clucking as the fluffy
                                 yellow chickens strayed beneath the uneven edges
                                 of their pointed prisons and made independent
                                 excursions into the world.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1105">In the far east the day was slowly breaking, and
                                 the open country was flooded with pale, washed-out
                                 grays, like the background of an impressionist
                                 painting.  A heavy dew had risen in the night, and as
                                 the boy passed through the dripping weeds on his
                                 way to the stable they left a chill moisture upon his bare
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1107"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="37" data-tei-n="39"> </a></span>
                                 feet.  His eyes were heavy with sleep, and to his
                                 cloudy gaze the familiar objects of the barnyard
                                 assumed grotesque and distorted shapes.  The
                                 manure heap near the doorway presented an effect
                                 of unreality, the pig-pen seemed to have suffered
                                 witchery since the evening before, and the
                                 haystack, looming vaguely in the drab distance,
                                 appeared to be woven of some phantasmal fabric.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1110">He led out the old sorrel mare and followed her
                                 into the large ploughed field beyond the cow-pen,
                                 where the harrow was lying on one side of the
                                 brown ridges.  As he passed the pen the startled
                                 sheep huddled into a far corner, bleating plaintively,
                                 and the brindle cow looked after him with soft,
                                 persuasive eyes.  When he had attached the clanking
                                 chains of the plough harness to the single-tree, he
                                 caught up the ropes which served for reins and set
                                 out laboriously over the crumbling earth, which
                                 yielded beneath his feet and made walking difficult.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1113">The field extended from the cow-pen and the
                                 bright, green rows of vegetables that were raised
                                 for market to the reedy brook which divided his
                                 father's land from that belonging to General Battle.
                                 The brook was always cool and shady, and silvery
                                 with minnows darting over the shining pebbles
                                 beneath the clear water.  As Nicholas looked across
                                 the neutral furrows he could see the feathery
                                 branches of willows rising from the gray mist, and,
                                 farther still up the sloping hillside, the dew-drenched
                                 green of the mixed woodlands.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1116">The land before him had been upturned by
                                 shallow ploughing some days since, and it lay now
                                 pale and arid, the large clods of earth showing the detached
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1118"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="40"> </a></span>
                                 roots of grass and herbs, and presenting a hint of
                                 menacing destruction rather than the prospect of the
                                 peaceful art of cultivation.  It was the boy's duty to drag
                                 the soil free from grass, after which it would be laid out
                                 into rows some three feet apart.  When this was done two
                                 furrows would be thrown together to give what the
                                 farmers called a “rise,” the point of which would be
                                 finally levelled, when the ground would be ready for the
                                 peanut-sowing, which was performed entirely by hand.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1121">The boy worked industriously through the deepening
                                 dawn, giving an occasional “gee up, Rhody!” to the
                                 mare, and following the track of the harrow
                                 with much the same concentration of purpose as
                                 that displayed by his four-footed friend.  He was
                                 strong for his years, lithe as a sapling,
                                 and as fearless of elemental changes, and as he
                                 walked meditatively across the bare field he might have
                                 suggested to an onlooker the possible production of a
                                 vast fund of energy.

                                 streak of orange fluttered like a ribbon in the east.  In a
                                 moment a violet cloud floated above the distant hill, and
                                 as its ends curled up from the quickening heat it showed
                                 the splendour of a crimson lining.  A single ray of
                                 sunshine, pale as a spectral finger, pointed past the
                                 woodlands to the brook beneath the willows, and the
                                 vague blur of the mixed forest warmed into vivid tints,
                                 changing through variations from the clear emerald of
                                 young maples to the olive dusk of evergreens.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1128">Last of all the ploughed field, which had preserved a
                                 neutral cast, blushed faintly in the sunrise, glowing
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1130"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="41"> </a></span>
                                 to pale purple tones where the sod was newly turned.
                                 From the fugitive richness of the soil a warm breath rose
                                 suddenly, filling the air with the genial odour of earth
                                 and sunshine.  The shining, dark coils of worms were
                                 visible like threads in the bright brown clods.

                              <p id="d44710e1133">Nicholas raised his head and stared with unseeing
                                 eyes at the gorgeous east.  A rooster crowed shrilly, and
                                 he turned in the direction of the barnyard.  Then he
                                 flicked the ropes gently and went on, his gaze on the
                                 ground.  His thoughts, which at first were fixed solely
                                 upon the teeth of the harrow, took tumultuous flight, and
                                 he reviewed for the hundredth time his conversation with
                                 the judge and the vast avenue of the future which was
                                 opening before him.  He would not be like his father, of
                                 this he was convinced—his father, who was always
                                 working with nothing to show for it—whose planting
                                 was never on time, and whose implements were never in
                                 place.  His father had never had this gnawing desire to
                                 know things, this passionate hatred of the work which he
                                 might not neglect.  His father had never tried to beat
                                 against the barriers of his ignorance and been driven
                                 back, and beat again and wept, and read what he couldn't
                                 understand.  The teacher at the public school had told
                                 him that he was far ahead of his years, and yet they had
                                 taken him away when he was doing his level best, and
                                 put him to dragging the land, and gathering the peanuts,
                                 and carrying the truck to market, and marking the sheep
                                 with red paint, and bringing up the cows, and doing all
                                 the odd, innumerable jobs they could devise.  He let the
                                 ropes fall for an instant and dug his fist into
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1135"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="42"> </a></span>
                                 his eye; then he took them up again and went on
                                 stolidly.  At last the sun came out boldly above the
                                 hill, and the hollows were flooded with light.  In the
                                 centre of the field the boy's head glowed like some
                                 large red insect.  A hawk, winging slowly above him,
                                 looked down as if uncertain of his species, and
                                 fluttered off indifferently.

                                 the field, and Nicholas was sent to drive the sheep
                                 to the pasture.  With vigorous wavings of a piece of
                                 brushwood, and many darts from right to left, he
                                 succeeded finally in driving them across the road
                                 and through the gate on the opposite side, after
                                 which he returned to assist his stepmother about the
                                 house.  Not until nine o'clock, when he had seen the
                                 Battle children going up the road, was he free to set
                                 off at a run for Kingsborough.

                                 wastelands, into the woods, down the road to the
                                 hillside, and down the hillside to the road again, he
                                 went too rapidly for thought.  The fresh air brushed
                                 his heated face gently, and, at the edge of the wood,
                                 where the shallow puddles lingered, myriads of blue
                                 and yellow butterflies scattered into variegated
                                 clumps of colour at his approach, darting from the
                                 moist heaps of last year's leaves to the shining
                                 rivulets in the wheel ruts by the way.  A partridge
                                 whistled from the yellowing green of the wheat, and
                                 a rabbit stole noiselessly from the sassafras in the
                                 ditch and shot shy glances of alarm; but he did not
                                 turn his head, and his hand held no ready stone.

                                 reached the judge's house, and stood before the little
                                 office in the garden where the school was held, his
                                 courage misgave him, and he leaned, trembling,
                                 against the arbour where a grapevine grew.  The
                                 sound of voices floated out to him, mingled with
                                 bright, girlish laughter, and, looking through the open
                                 window, he saw the light curls of a little girl against
                                 the darker head of a boy.  He choked suddenly with
                                 shyness, and would have hesitated there until the
                                 morning was over had not the judge's old servant,
                                 Caesar, espied him from the dining-room window.

                                 demanded suspiciously, and then called to some one
                                 inside the house.  “Marse George, dat ar Burr boy is

                                 moustache.  His name was Graves, and he regarded
                                 what he called the judge's “quixotism” with
                                 condescending good-nature.

                                 about you.  So you won't be a farmer, eh?  And you
                                 won't stay in your class?  Well, come in and we'll

                                 son, Tom, nodded to him from across the room,
                                 and Bernard Battle grinned over his shoulder at his

                                 Webb, made a face which convulsed little Sally
                                 Burwell, who hid her merriment in her curls.  There
                                 were several other children in the room, but
                                 Nicholas did not see them distinctly.  Something had
                                 got before his eyes and there was a lump in his
                                 throat.  He sat rigidly in his seat, his straw hat, with
                                 the shoestring around the crown, lying upon the
                                 desk before him.  He looked neither to the right nor
                                 to the left, keeping his frightened gaze upon the
                                 tutor's face.

                              <p id="d44710e1168">Mr. Graves asked him a few questions, which he
                                 could not answer, and then, giving him a book,
                                 turned to the other children.  As the lessons went on
                                 it seemed to Nicholas that he had never known
                                 anything in his life; that he should never know
                                 anything; and that he should always remain the
                                 most ignorant person on earth—unless that lot fell to
                                 Sairy Jane.

                                 appeared to be insurmountable.  Even if he had the

                                 —his head would prevent it.

                                 an odd assortment of cracked china and chemist
                                 bottles.  There was also a square mahogany chest,

                                 was found to be little needed, and was finally given

                                 ragged brim of his hat.

                              <p id="d44710e1204">“I reckon they're my freckles,” he said doggedly.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1208">“And I reckon you can keep 'em,” retorted
                                 Bernard, mimicking his tone.  “We ain't going to
                                 steal 'em.  I say, Eugie, here're some freckles for sale!”

                              <p id="d44710e1213">The dark little girl, who was putting up her books
                                 in one corner, looked up and shook her head.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1216">“Let me alone!” she replied shortly, and returned to
                                 her work, tugging at the straps with both hands.  Dudley
                                 Webb—a handsome, upright boy, well dressed in a dark
                                 suit and linen shirt—lounged over as he munched a
                                 sandwich.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1219">He looked at Nicholas from head to foot, and his gaze
                                 was returned with stolid defiance.  Nicholas did not flinch,
                                 but for the first time he felt ashamed of his ugliness, of
                                 his coarse clothes, of his briar-scratched legs, of his
                                 freckles, and of the unalterable colour of his hair.  He
                                 wished with all his heart that he were safely in the field
                                 with his father, driving the one-horse harrow across
                                 upturned furrows.  He didn't want to learn anything any
                                 more.  He wanted only to get away.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1222">“He's common,” said Dudley at last, throwing a crust
                                 of bread through the open window.  “He's as common
                                 as—as dirt.  I heard mother say so—”
                              </p>

                                 doubtfully, turning his honest eyes on Nicholas again.
                                 “He told Mr. Graves that he was a most uncommon boy.”

                              <p id="d44710e1232">“Oh, well, you can play with him if you like,” rejoined
                                 Dudley resolutely,  “but I shan't.  He's old Amos Burr's
                                 son, anyway, who never wore a whole shirt in his life.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1235">“He had on one yesterday,” said Bernard Battle
                                 impartially.  “I saw it.  It was just made and hadn't been
                                 washed.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1238">Nicholas looked up stubbornly.  “You let my
                                 father alone!” he exclaimed, spurred by the desire
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1240"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="45" data-tei-n="47"> </a></span>
                                 to resent something and finding it easier to fight for
                                 another than himself.  “You let my father alone, or I'll
                                 make you!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1243">“I'd like to see you!” retorted Dudley wrathfully,
                                 and Nicholas had squared up for the first blow, when
                                 before his swimming gaze a defender intervened.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1246">“You jest let him alone!” cried a voice, and the
                                 flutter of a blue cotton skirt divided Dudley from his
                                 adversary.  “You jest let him alone.  If you call
                                 him common I'll hit you, an'—an' you can't hit me back!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1250">“Eugie, you ought to be—” began Bernard,
                                 but she pushed the combatants aside with decisive
                                 thrusts of her sunburned little hand, and planted
                                 herself upon the threshold, her large, black eyes
                                 glowing like shaded lamps.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1253">“He wan't doin' nothin' to you, and you jest let him
                                 be.  He's goin' to tote my books home, an' you shan't
                                 touch him.  I reckon I know what's common as well as you
                                 do—an' he ain't—he ain't common.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1256">Then she caught Nicholas's arm and marched off like a
                                 dispensing providence with a vassal in tow.  Nicholas
                                 followed obediently.  He was sufficiently cowed into
                                 non-resistance, and he felt a wholesome awe of his
                                 defender, albeit he wished that it had been a boy like
                                 himself instead of a slip of a girl with short skirts
                                 and a sunbonnet.  At the bottom of his heart there
                                 existed an instinctive contempt of the sex which
                                 Eugenia represented, developed by the fact that it
                                 was not force but weakness that had vanquished his
                                 victorious opponent.  Dudley Webb was a gentleman,
                                 and only a bully would strike a girl,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1258"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="46" data-tei-n="48"> </a></span>
                                 even if she were a spitfire—the term by which he
                                 characterised Eugenia.  He remembered suddenly
                                 her exultant, “an' you can't hit me back!” and it
                                 seemed to him that, even in the righteous cause of
                                 his deliverance, she had taken an unfair and
                                 feminine advantage of the handsome boy for whom
                                 he cherished a shrinking admiration.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1261">As for Eugenia herself, she was troubled by no
                                 such misgivings.  She walked slightly in front of him,
                                 her blue skirt swinging briskly from side to side, her
                                 white sunbonnet hanging by its strings from her
                                 shoulders.  Above the starched ruffles rose her small
                                 dark head and white profile, and Nicholas could see
                                 the determined curve of her chin and the humorous
                                 tremor of her nostril.  It was a vivid little face, devoid
                                 of colour except for the warm mouth, and sparkling
                                 with animation which burned steadily at the white
                                 heat of intensity—but to Nicholas she
                                 was only a plain, dark, little girl, with an
                                 unhealthy pallor of complexion.  He was grateful,
                                 nevertheless, and when his first regret that she was
                                 not a boy was over he experienced a thrill of
                                 affection.  It was the first time that any one had
                                 deliberately taken his part in the face of opposing
                                 odds, and the stand seemed to bring him closer to
                                 his companion.  He held her books tightly, and his
                                 face softened as he looked at her, until it was
                                 transfigured by the warmth of his emotion.  Then, as
                                 they passed the college grounds, where a knot of
                                 students greeted Eugenia hilariously, and turned
                                 upon the Old Stage Road, he reached out timidly to
                                 take the small hand hanging by her side.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1264">“It's better walkin' on this side the road,” he said
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1266"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="47" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span>
                                 with a mild assumption of masculine supremacy.  “I
                                 wouldn't walk in the dust.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1269">Eugenia looked at him gravely and drew her
                                 hand away.

                              <p id="d44710e1273">“You mustn't do that,” she responded severely.
                                 “When I said you weren't common I didn't mean that
                                 you really weren't, you know; because, of course,
                                 you are.  I jest meant that I wouldn't let them say
                                 so.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1276">Nicholas stood in the centre of the road and
                                 stared at her, his face flushing and a slow rage
                                 creeping into his eyes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1279">For a moment he stood in trembling silence.
                                 Then he threw the books from him into the sand at her
                                 feet, and with a choking sob sped past her to vanish
                                 amid a whirl of dust in the sunny distance.

                                 scattered possessions.  She was all alone upon the
                                 highway, and around her the open fields rolled off
                                 into the green of far-off forests.  The sunshine fell
                                 hotly over her, and straight ahead the white road
                                 lay like a living thing.

                              <p id="d44710e1296">Battle Hall was a square white frame house with
                                 bright-green window shutters and a deep front
                                 porch, supported by heavy pillars, and reached from
                                 the gravelled walk below by a flight of rugged stone
                                 steps.  In the rear of the house, through which a
                                 wide hall ran, dividing the rooms of the first floor,
                                 there was another porch similar to the one at the
                                 front, except that the pillars were hidden in musk
                                 roses and the long benches at either side were of
                                 plain, unpainted pine.  At the foot of the back steps a
                                 narrow, well-trodden path led to the vegetable
                                 garden, which was separated from the yard by what
                                 was called “Cattle Lane”—a name derived from
                                 the morning and evening passage of the cows on
                                 their way to and from the pasture.

                              <p id="d44710e1299">Beginning at the gate into the garden, where the
                                 tall white palings were gay with hollyhocks and
                                 heavy-headed sunflowers, a grapevine trellis
                                 extended to the farmyard at the end of the lane,
                                 whence an overgrown walk led across tangled
                                 meadows to the negro “quarters”—a long,
                                 whitewashed row of almost deserted cabins.  Since
                                 the close of the war the “quarters” had fallen
                                 partly into disuse and had decayed rapidly, though
                                 some few were still tenanted by the former slaves,
                                 who gathered as of old in the doorways of an
                                 evening to strum upon broken-stringed banjos and to
                                 wrap the hair of their small offspring.  Beyond
                                 this row there was a slight elevation
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1301"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="49" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span>
                                 called “Hickory Hill,” where Uncle Ishmael
                                 had lived for more than seventy years; and at the
                                 foot of the hill, on the other side, near “Sweet Gum
                                 Spring,” there were several neatly patched log
                                 cabins occupied by the house servants, who held in
                                 social contempt the field hands in the neighbouring
                                 “quarters.”  Overlooking the “Sweet Gum Spring,” on
                                 a loftier hill, was the family graveyard, which was
                                 walled off from the orchard near by, where the
                                 twisted old fruit trees had long since yielded the
                                 larger part of their abundance.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1304">At the front of the Hall the view was vastly
                                 different.  There the great blue-grass lawn was
                                 thickly studded with ancient elms and maples,
                                 whose shade fell like a blanket upon the velvety sod
                                 beneath.  The gravelled walk, beginning at the front
                                 steps, was bordered on either side by rows of
                                 closely clipped box, which ended in the long avenue
                                 of cedars leading from the lawn to the distant
                                 turnpike.  To the right of the house there were three
                                 pointed aspens, which shivered like skeletons in
                                 silver, holding grimly aloof from the vivid pink of the
                                 crepe myrtle at their feet.  Beyond them was the
                                 well-house, with a long moss-grown trough where
                                 the horses and the cows came to drink, and across
                                 the road began the cornlands, which stretched in
                                 rhythmic undulations to the dark belt of the pine
                                 forest.  On the left of the box walk, in a direct line
                                 from the three aspens, towered a huge sycamore,
                                 and from one of its protecting arms, shaded by large
                                 fan-like leaves, a child's swing dangled by a thick
                                 hemp rope.  Near the sycamore, where an old oak
                                 had fallen, the rotting stump was hidden by a high
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1306"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="50" data-tei-n="52"> </a></span>
                                 “rockery,” edged with conch shells, and over the
                                 rough gray rocks a tangle of garden flowers ran
                                 wild—sweet-william, petunias, phlox, and the mossy
                                 stems of red and yellow portulaca.  On the western
                                 side of the house there was a spreading mimosa
                                 tree, its sensitive branches brushing the green
                                 shutters of a window in the second story.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1309">The Hall had been built by the general's father
                                 when, because of family dissensions, he had
                                 decided to move from a central county to the more
                                 thinly settled country surrounding Kingsborough.
                                 There the general had passed his boyhood, and
                                 there he had left his wife when he had gone to the
                                 war.  At the beginning of the struggle he had freed
                                 his slaves and buckled on his sword.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1313">“They may have the negroes, and welcome,” he
                                 had said to the judge.  “Do you think I'd fight for a
                                 damned darkey?  It's the principle, sir—the principle!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1316">And the judge, who had not freed his servants,
                                 but who would have thought as little of using a
                                 profane word as of alluding in disrespectful terms to
                                 a family portrait, had replied gravely:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1319">“My dear Tom, you will find principle much
                                 better to fight for than to live on.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1322">But the general had gone with much valour and
                                 more vehemence.  He had enlisted as a private, had
                                 risen within a couple of years to a colonelcy, and
                                 had been raised to the rank of general by the
                                 unanimous voice of his neighbours upon his return
                                 home.  After an enthusiastic reception at Kingsborough
                                 he had mounted a heavy-weight horse and ridden out to
                                 the Hall, to find the grounds a tangle of weeds and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1324"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="51" data-tei-n="53"> </a></span>
                                 his wife with the pallor of death upon her brow.
                                 She had rallied at his coming, had lingered some sad
                                 years an invalid in the great room next the parlour,
                                 and had died quietly at last as she knelt in prayer
                                 beside her high white bed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1327">For days after this the empty house was like a
                                 coffin.  The children ran in tears through the
                                 shuttered rooms, and the servants lost their lingering
                                 shred of discipline.  When the funeral was over, the
                                 general made some spasmodic show of authority,
                                 but his heart was not in it, and he wavered for lack
                                 of the sustaining hold of his wife's frail hand.  He
                                 dismissed the overseer and undertook to some
                                 extent the management of the farm, but the crops
                                 failed and the hay rotted in the fields before it was
                                 got into the barn.  Then, as things were galloping
                                 from bad to worse, a letter came from his sister,
                                 Miss Christina, and in a few days she arrived with a
                                 cartload of luggage and a Maltese cat in a wicker
                                 basket.  From the moment when she stepped out of
                                 the carriage at the end of the avenue and ascended
                                 the box-trimmed walk to the stone steps, the
                                 difficulties disentangled and the domestic problems
                                 dwindled into the simplest of arithmetical sums.  By
                                 some subtle law of the influence of the energetic
                                 she assumed at once the rights of authority.  From
                                 the master of the house to the field hands in the
                                 “quarters,” all bent to her regenerating rule.  She
                                 opened the windows in the airy rooms, cleaned off
                                 the storeroom shelves with soda and water, and put
                                 the marauding small negroes to weeding the lawn.
                                 Before her passionate purification the place was
                                 purged of the dust of years.  The hardwood floors of the
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1329"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="52" data-tei-n="54"> </a></span>
                                 wide old halls began to shine like mirrors, the
                                 assortment of odds and ends in the attic was
                                 relegated to an outhouse, and even the general's
                                 aunt, Miss Griselda Grigsby, was turned
                                 unceremoniously out of her apartment before the
                                 all-pervading soapsuds of cleaning day.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1332">As for the servants, a sudden miraculous zeal
                                 possessed them.  Within a fortnight the garden rows
                                 were hoed free from grass, the hops were gathered
                                 from the fence, and the weeds on the lawn vanished
                                 beneath small black fingers.  Even the annual
                                 threshing of the harvest was accomplished under
                                 the overseeing eye of “Miss Chris,” as she was
                                 called by the coloured population.  During the week
                                 that the old machine poured out its chaffless wheat
                                 and the driver whistled in the centre of the treadmill
                                 Miss Chris appeared at the barn at noon each day
                                 to warn the hands against waste of time and to see
                                 that the mules were well watered.

                              <p id="d44710e1336">But the revolutions without were as naught to the
                                 internal ones.  Aunt Verbeny, the cook, whose

                                 giving her an awkward, waddling walk.

                                 fluffy curls about her large pink face, soft brown
                                 eyes, and a full double chin that fell over a round
                                 cameo brooch bearing the head of Minerva set in a
                                 plain gold band.  In winter she wore gowns of black
                                 Henrietta cloth, made with plain bodices and full
                                 plaited skirts; in summer she wore the same skirts
                                 with loosely fitting white linen sacques, trimmed in
                                 delicate embroideries, with muslin ruffles falling
                                 over her plump hands.  When she came to the Hall
                                 she brought with her innumerable reminiscences of
                                 her childhood, which she told in a musical voice
                                 with girlish laughter.

                                 his fitful overseering.  He rose early and spent his
                                 long days sitting upon the front porch, smoking an
                                 old briar pipe and reading the Richmond papers.
                                 Occasionally he would ride at a jogging pace round
                                 the fields, giving casual directions to the workers,
                                 but as his weight increased he found it difficult to
                                 mount into the saddle, and, at last, desisted from the
                                 attempt.  He preferred to sit in peace in his cane
                                 rocking chair, looking down the box walk into the
                                 twilight of the cedar avenue, or gazing placidly
                                 beyond the aspens and the well-house to the streaked ribbons
                                 of the ripening corn.  It was said that he had never been the
                                 same man since the death of his wife.  Certainly he laughed as
                                 heartily and his jovial face had taken a ruddier tint, but there
                                 was a superficiality in his exuberant cheerfulness which told that
                                 it was not well rooted below the surface.  His jokes were as
                                 ready as ever, but he had fallen into an absent-minded
                                 habit of repetition, and sometimes
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1383"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="55" data-tei-n="57"> </a></span>
                                 repeated the same stories at breakfast and supper.
                                 He talked freely of his dead wife, he even made
                                 ill-placed jests about his widowerhood, and he never
                                 failed to kiss a pair of red lips when the chance
                                 offered; but, for all that, his gaze often wandered
                                 past the huge sycamore to the family graveyard,
                                 where rank periwinkle grew and mocking-birds
                                 nested.  Through the long summer not a Sunday
                                 passed that he did not take fresh flowers to one of
                                 the neatly trimmed mounds where the marble

                                 asked, marching into the brick storeroom, where his
                                 sister was slicing ripe, red tomatoes into a blue
                                 china bowl.  “What do you think that fool Ish has
                                 done?”

                                 fresh-coloured face expressing mild apprehension.
                                 She had rolled back her linen sleeves, and the juice
                                 of the tomatoes stained her full, dimpled wrists.

                              <p id="d44710e1438">“He hasn't killed himself?” she inquired anxiously.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1441">“Killed himself?” roared the general.  “He'll live
                                 forever.  I don't believe he'd die if he were

                              <p id="d44710e1446">“Moved off!” echoed Miss Chris faintly.  “Why,
                                 I believe Uncle Ish was living in that cabin on
                                 Hickory Hill before I was born.  I remember going
                                 up there to help him gather hickory nuts when I
                                 wasn't six years old.  I couldn't have been six
                                 because mammy Betsey was with me, and she died
                                 before I was seven.  I declare there were always
                                 more nuts on those trees than any I ever saw—”

                              <p id="d44710e1449">But the general broke in upon her reminiscences,
                                 and she took up a fresh tomato and peeled it
                                 carefully with a sharp-edged knife.
                              </p>

                                 “and told him if he went on living on my land he'd go
                                 back to slavery, and, bless your life, he has gone
                                 —gone to that little one-room shanty where his
                                 daughter used to live, between my place and Burr's
                                 —as if I'd have him,” he concluded wrathfully.  “I
                                 wouldn't own that fool again if he dropped into my
                                 lap straight from heaven!”

                              <p id="d44710e1456">Miss Chris laughed merrily.</p>

                                 with him.  It is a pity for him to be moving off at his

                                 from the avenue and came up the walk between the

                                 remember just as well as if it were yesterday old

                                 less he accomplished.  But, as for Eugenia, that isn't
                                 the worst about her.  Just the other morning, when I

                                 with her arm round the neck of Aunt Verbeny's
                                 little Suke.  I declare I was so upset I let the quart
                                 pot fall into the potato bin!”

                                 protested Eugenia, looking up from her father's
                                 julep, which she was tasting.  “And I'm 'bliged to
                                 have a bosom friend.”

                              <p id="d44710e1563">“Bosom friend, you puss!” he roared.  “Why can't
                                 you choose a bosom friend of your own colour?
                                 What do you want with a bosom friend as black as
                                 the ace of spades?”

                                 said Miss Chris severely.  “Now go upstairs and
                                 wash your face and hands before dinner.  It is
                                 almost ready.  I wonder where Bernard is!”

                                 asked; but Miss Chris shook her head decisively.

                                 you that there's no such word as 'twell'?  Now, go
                                 right straight upstairs.”

                                 She had learned from her father and the servants

                              <p id="d44710e1596">When Eugenia came downstairs she found the
                                 family seated at dinner, Miss Chris and her father
                                 beaming upon each other across a dish of fried
                                 chicken and a home-cured ham.  Bernard was on
                                 Miss Chris's right hand, and on the other side of the
                                 table Eugenia's seat separated the general from
                                 Aunt Griselda, who sat severely buttering her toast
                                 before a brown earthenware teapot ornamented by
                                 a raised design of Rebecca at the well.  Aunt
                                 Griselda was a lean, dried-up old lady, with a sharp,
                                 curved nose like the beak of a bird, and smoothly
                                 parted hair brushed low over her ears and held in
                                 place by a tortoise-shell comb.  There were deep
                                 channels about her eyes, worn by the constant
                                 falling of acrid tears, and her cheeks were wrinkled
                                 and yellowed like old parchment.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1599">Twenty years ago, when the general had first
                                 brought home his young wife, before her buoyancy
                                 had faltered, and before the five little head-boards
                                 to the five stillborn children had been set up amid
                                 the periwinkle in the family graveyard, Aunt Griselda
                                 had written from the home of her sister to say that
                                 she would stop over at Battle Hall on her
                                 way to Richmond.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1602">The general had received the news joyfully, and
                                 the best chamber had been made ready by the hospitable
                                 hands of his young wife.  Delicate, lavender-scented
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1604"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span>
                                 linen had been put on the old tester-bed and
                                 curtains of flowered chintz tied back from the
                                 window seats.  Amelia Battle had placed a bowl of
                                 tea-roses upon the dressing table and gone
                                 graciously down to the avenue to welcome her
                                 guest.  From the family carriage Aunt Griselda had
                                 emerged soured and eccentric.  She had gone up to
                                 the best chamber, unpacked her trunks, hung up her
                                 bombazine skirts in the closet, ordered green tea
                                 and toast, and settled herself for the remainder of
                                 her days.  That was twenty years ago, and she still
                                 slept in the best chamber, and still ordered tea and
                                 toast at the table.  She had grown sourer with years
                                 and more eccentric with authority, but the general never
                                 failed to treat her crotchets with courtesy or to
                                 open the door for her when she came and went.
                                 To the mild complaints of Miss Chris and the
                                 protestations of Eugenia he returned the invariable
                                 warning: “She is our guest—remember what is due
                                 to a guest, my dears.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1607">And when Miss Chris placidly suggested that the
                                 privileges of guestship wore threadbare when they
                                 were stretched over twenty years, and Eugenia
                                 fervently hoped that there were no visitors in
                                 heaven, the general responded to each in turn:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1611">“It's the right of a guest to determine the length
                                 of his stay, and, as a Virginian, my house is open
                                 as long as it has a roof over it.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1614">So Aunt Griselda drank her green tea in acrid
                                 silence, turning at intervals to reprove Bernard for
                                 taking too large mouthfuls or to request Eugenia to
                                 remove her elbows from the table.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1617">To-day, when Eugenia descended, she was gazing

                                 stonily into Miss Chris's genial face, and listening
                                 constrainedly to a story at which the general was
                                 laughing heartily.

                                 was concluding.  “She never used any other pattern,
                                 and I remember when Cousin Bob Baker once sent
                                 her a set of teaspoons with a different border, she
                                 returned them to Richmond to be exchanged.  Do
                                 you remember the time she came to mother's when
                                 we were children, Tom?  Eugie, will you have
                                 breast or leg?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1625">“I don't think I could have been at home,” said
                                 the general, his face growing animated, as it always
                                 did, in a discussion of old times; “but I do
                                 remember once, when I was at Uncle Robert's, they
                                 sent me eighteen miles on horseback for the doctor,
                                 because Aunt Callowell had such a queer feeling in
                                 her side when she started to walk.  I can see her
                                 now holding her side and saying: 'I can't possibly
                                 take a step!  Robert, I can't take a step!'  And when
                                 I brought the doctor eighteen miles from home, on
                                 his old gray mare, he found that she'd put a shoe on
                                 one foot and a slipper on the other.”

                                 and the general shook his finger at her and formed
                                 the word “guest” with his mouth.  Miss Chris
                                 changed the subject by begging Aunt Griselda to
                                 have a wing of chicken.

                                 rejoined, still wiping her eyes, “though it is hard to
                                 be accused of a temper before my own nephew.
                                 But I know I am a burden, and I have overstayed

                                 in hurt tones.  “You know I didn't accuse you of
                                 anything.  I only meant that you would feel better if
                                 you didn't drink so much tea and ate more meat—”

                                 may put my teapot away.”

                                 rising to the occasion, he said hurriedly: “By the

                                 that old Dr. Smith was dead.  It was only last week
                                 that I met him on his way to town with his niece's
                                 daughter, and he told me that he had never been in
                                 better health in his life.”

                                 remember he made me lie in bed with blankets over
                                 me, though it was August, and he wouldn't let me
                                 drink anything except hot flax-seed tea.  They say all

                                 Miss Chris's absent-minded manipulations.  She
                                 reached for the round, old silver pitcher, and poured
                                 the yellow cream on the sugared berries without
                                 pausing in her soft, monotonous flow of words.

                                 he would not let them give it to his son, Lawrence,
                                 when he broke his leg on the threshing machine.  It
                                 was a mania with him, for, when I was nursing in
                                 the hospitals during the war, he told me with his
                                 own lips that he believed the Lord was on our side

                                 made sudden desperate skirmishes into the tangled

                                 wagging.  Up the steep ascent of the orchard a
                                 rocky trail ran, bordered by a rail fence.  From the

                                 emerald valleys, bare clearings into luxuriant crops,

                                 “bottoms” beside the enrichening river.

                                 Bernard climbed a tree where summer apples hung

                                 her blue skirt beneath the overhanging boughs.  The

                                 flashed the shining bodies of hundreds of minnows,
                                 passing back and forth with brisk wriggles of their
                                 fine, steel-coloured tails.  On the Battle side of the
                                 bank a huge, blue-winged dragonfly buzzed above
                                 the flaunting red and yellow faces of three

                                 retreat at the sight of his own reflection in the
                                 water.

                                 She seated herself upon the topmost step and made
                                 a place for Jim beside her.

                              <p id="d44710e1860">The general was silent for some time, smoking
                                 thoughtfully and staring past the aspens and the

                                 it was with embarrassed hesitation.

                                 barked frantically from the shelter of her arms.
                                 “He's Delphy's Jake.”

                              <p id="d44710e1932">Twice a year, on fine days in spring and fall, Aunt
                                 Griselda's bombazine dresses were taken from the
                                 whitewashed closet and hung out to air upon the
                                 clothesline at the back of the house, while pungent
                                 odours of tar and camphor were exhaled from the full
                                 black folds.  On these days Aunt Griselda would remain in
                                 her room, sorting faded relics which she took from a
                                 cedar chest and spread beside her on the floor.  The door
                                 was kept locked at such times, but once Eugenia, who
                                 had gone with Congo to carry Aunt Griselda her toast
                                 and tea, had caught a glimpse of a yellowed swiss muslin
                                 frock and the leather case of a daguerreotype containing
                                 the picture of a round-eyed girl with rosy cheeks.  Aunt
                                 Griselda had hidden them hastily away at the child's
                                 entrance—hidden them with that nervous, awkward
                                 haste which dreads a dawning jest of itself; but Eugenia
                                 had seen that her old eyes were red and her voice more
                                 rasping than usual.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1935">Sixty years ago Aunt Griselda had had her romance,
                                 and she still kept her love-letters tied up with discoloured
                                 ribbons and laid away in the cedar chest.  It was but the
                                 skeleton of a love story—the adolescent ardours of a
                                 high-spirited country girl and the high-spirited son of a
                                 neighbouring farmer.  When the quarrel came the letters
                                 were overlooked when the ring went back.  Griselda Grigsby had
                                 tossed them carelessly into the cedar chest and gone out to
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1937"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="76" data-tei-n="78"> </a></span>
                                 forget them.  Her heart had not been deeply touched
                                 and it soon mended.  No other lovers came, and she
                                 lived her quiet life in her father's house, gathering
                                 garden flowers for the great, blue bowls in the
                                 parlour, teaching the catechism to small black
                                 slaves, and making stiff, old-fashioned samplers in
                                 crewels.  The high-spirited lover had loved
                                 elsewhere and died of a fever, and, beyond a
                                 passing regret, she thought little of him.  There were
                                 nearer interests, and she was still the petted
                                 daughter of her father's house—the eldest and the
                                 best beloved.  Then the crash came.  The old people
                                 passed away, the house changed hands, Aunt
                                 Griselda was stranded upon the high tide of
                                 hospitality—and crewel work went out of fashion.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1940">In her sister's home she became a constant guest
                                 —one to be offered the favoured share and to be
                                 treated with tender, increasing tolerance—not to be
                                 loved.  Since the death of her parents none had
                                 loved her, though many had borne gently with her
                                 spoiled fancies.  But her coming in had brought no
                                 light, and her going out had left nothing dark.  She
                                 was old and ill-tempered and bitter of speech, and,
                                 though all doors opened hospitably at her approach,
                                 all closed quickly when she was gone.  Her spoiled
                                 youth had left her sensitive to trivial stings,
                                 unforgivable to fancied wrongs.  In a childish
                                 oversight she detected hidden malice and implacable
                                 hate in a thoughtless jest.  Her bitterness and her
                                 years waxed greater together, and she lost alike her
                                 youth and her self-control.  When she had yearned
                                 for passionate affection she had found kindly
                                 tolerance, and the longings of her hidden nature, which
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1942"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span>
                                 none knew, were expressed in rasping words and
                                 acrid tears.  Once, some years after Bernard's birth,
                                 she had called him into her room as she sat among
                                 her relics, and had shown him the daguerreotype.

                                 had broken into peevish cries and struggled free,
                                 tearing with his foot the ruffle of the swiss muslin
                                 gown.

                                 sharp, scolding words, and had sat down to darn the
                                 muslin ruffle with delicate, old-fashioned stitches.

                              <p id="d44710e1952">It was only when all living love had failed her that
                                 she returned to the dead.  She had gathered the
                                 letters of nearly sixty years ago from the bottom of
                                 the cedar chest, reading them through her
                                 spectacles with bleared, watery eyes.  Those subtle
                                 sentimentalities which linger like aromas in a heart
                                 too aged for passion were liberated by the bundle of
                                 yellow scrawls written by hands that were dust.  As
                                 she sat in her stiff bombazine skirts beside the
                                 opened chest, peering with worry-ravaged face at
                                 the old letters, she forgot that she was no longer
                                 one with the girl in the muslin frock, and that the
                                 inciter of this exuberant emotion was as dead as the
                                 emotion itself.

                              <p id="d44710e1955">When the dresses were brought up to her she
                                 would put them on again and go down to flinch
                                 before kindly eyes and to make embittered
                                 speeches in her high, shrill voice.  Outwardly she
                                 grew more soured and more eccentric.  On mild
                                 summer evenings she would come down stairs with her head
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e1957"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="78" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span>
                                 wrapped in a pink knitted “nubia,” and stroll back and
                                 forth along the gravelled walk, her gaunt figure passing
                                 into the dusk of the cedar avenue and emerging like the
                                 erratic shadow of one of the sombre trees.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1960">Sometimes Eugenia joined her, but Bernard, her
                                 favourite, held shyly aloof.  In her exercise she seldom
                                 spoke, and her words were peevish ones, but there was
                                 grim pathos in her carriage as she moved slowly back
                                 and forth between the straight rows of box.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1963">After supper the family assembled on the porch and
                                 talked in a desultory way until ten o'clock, when the
                                 lights were put out and the house retired to rest.  Eugenia
                                 slept in a great, four-post bedstead with Aunt Chris, and
                                 the bed was so large and soft and billowy that she
                                 seemed to lose herself suddenly at night in its
                                 lavender-scented midst, and to be as suddenly discovered in the
                                 morning by Rindy, the house-girl, when she came with
                                 her huge pails of warm water.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1966">Those fresh summer dawns of Eugenia's childhood
                                 became among her dearest memories in after years.  There
                                 were hours when, awaking, wide-eyed, before the house
                                 was astir, she would rise on her elbow and look out
                                 across the dripping lawn, where each dewdrop was
                                 charged with opalescent tints, to the western horizon,
                                 where the day broke in a cloud of gold.  The song of a
                                 mocking-bird in the poplars of the little graveyard came
                                 to her with unsuspected melody—a melody drawn from
                                 the freshness, the loneliness, the half-awakened calls
                                 from hidden nests and the lyric ecstasy of dawn.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e1972">Then, with the rising of the sun, Aunt Chris would
                                 turn upon her pillow and open her soft, brown eyes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1975">“It is not good for little folks to be awake so early,”
                                 she would say, and there would rush upon the child a
                                 sense of warmth and tenderness and comfort, and she
                                 would nestle closer to her sweet, white pillow.  With the
                                 beginning of day began also the demands upon the time
                                 of Miss Chris.  First the new overseer, knocking at her
                                 door, would call through the crack that a cow had calved,
                                 or that one of the sheep was too ill to go to pasture.
                                 Then Rindy, entering with her pails, would shake a
                                 pessimistic head.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1978">“Lawd, Miss Chris, one er dem ole coons done eat up
                                 er hull pa'cel er yo' chickens.”  And Miss Chris, at once
                                 the prop and the mainstay of the Battle fortunes, would
                                 rise with anxious exclamations and put on her full black
                                 skirt and linen sacque.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e1981">When breakfast was over Miss Chris went into the
                                 storeroom each morning and came out with a basin of
                                 corn-meal dough, followed by Sampson bearing an axe
                                 and Aunt Verbeny jingling the hen-house keys.  The slow
                                 procession then filed out to the space before the hen-house,
                                 the door of which was flung back, while Aunt Verbeny
                                 clucked at a little distance.  Miss Chris scattered
                                 her dough upon the ground and, while her unsuspecting
                                 beneficiaries made their morning meal, she pointed out to
                                 Sampson, the executioner, the members of the feathered
                                 community destined to be sacrificed to the carnivorous
                                 habits of their fellow mortals.
                              </p>

                                 she said with the indifference of an abstract deity.
                                 “Is it fat?  And the domineca pullet, and the two
                                 roosters we bought from Delphy.”

                              <p id="d44710e1990">And when Sampson had seized upon the victims
                                 of the fiat she turned to inspect the bunches of
                                 fowls offered by neighbouring breeders.

                                 in the background, three drooping chickens in each
                                 hand, their legs tied together with strips of a purple
                                 calico which Marthy was making into a dress for
                                 Sairy Jane.

                              <p id="d44710e1996">Seeing that Miss Chris had delivered her
                                 judgments, he came forward and proffered his
                                 captives with an abashed demeanour.

                              <p id="d44710e1999">“How much are they worth?” asked Miss Chris
                                 in her cheerful tones, while Aunt Verbeny gave a
                                 suspicious poke beneath one of the flapping wings,
                                 followed by a grunt of disparagement.

                                 he returned, blushing as Aunt Verbeny grunted
                                 again, “and the four smallest can go for twenty
                                 cents.”

                              <p id="d44710e2009">But when the bargain was concluded he lingered
                                 and added shamefacedly: “Won't you please let
                                 that red-and-black rooster live as long as you can?  I
                                 raised it.”

                              <p id="d44710e2015">Eugenia, who was hovering by, burst into tears
                                 and declared that the rooster should not die.

                                 her little tin bank from the top bureau drawer.

                              <p id="d44710e2023">When the arrangements were concluded Nicholas
                                 started empty-handed down the box walk, the
                                 money jingling in his pocket.  At the end of the long
                                 avenue of cedars there was a wide, unploughed
                                 common which extended for a quarter of a mile
                                 along the roadside.  In spring and summer the ground
                                 was white with daisies and in the autumn it donned
                                 gorgeous vestments of golden-rod and sumach.  In
                                 the centre of the waste, standing alike grim and
                                 majestic at all seasons, there was the charred
                                 skeleton of a gigantic tree, which had been stripped
                                 naked by a bolt of lightning long years ago.  At its
                                 foot a prickly clump of briars surrounded the
                                 blackened trunk in a decoration of green or red, and
                                 from this futile screen the spectral limbs rose boldly
                                 and were silhouetted against the far-off horizon like
                                 the masts of a wrecked and deserted ship.  A rail
                                 fence, where a trumpet-vine hung heavily, divided
                                 the field from the road, and several straggling sheep
                                 that had strayed from the distant flock stood looking
                                 shyly over the massive crimson clusters.

                              <p id="d44710e2026">When Nicholas came out from the funereal dusk
                                 of the cedars the field was almost blinding in the
                                 morning glare, the yellow-centred daisies rolling in
                                 the breeze like white-capped billows on a sunlit sea.
                                 From the avenue to his father's land the road was
                                 unbroken by a single shadow—only to the right, amid
                                 the young corn, there was a solitary pesimmon
                                 tree, and on the left the gigantic wreck stranded
                                 amid the tossing daisies.

                              <p id="d44710e2032">The sun was hot, and dust rose like smoke from
                                 the white streak of the road, which blazed beneath
                                 a cloudless sky.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2035">The boy was tired and thirsty, and as he tramped
                                 along the perspiration rose to his forehead and
                                 dropped upon his shoulder.  With a sigh of
                                 satisfaction he came upon the little cottage of his
                                 father and saw his stepmother taking the clothes in
                                 from the bushes where they had been spread to dry.
                                 It was Saturday, and ironing day, and he hoped for a
                                 chance at his lessons before night came, when he
                                 was so tired that the facts would not stick in his
                                 brain.  He thought that it must be very easy to study
                                 in the mornings when you were fresh and eager and
                                 before that leaden weight centred behind your
                                 eyeballs.

                                 his book to the orchard and flung himself down
                                 beneath the trees.  The judge had given him a biography
                                 of Jefferson, and he had learned his hero's life with lips
                                 and heart.  The day that it was finished

                                 he put the volume under his arm and went to the
                                 rector's house.

                                 love for children, turned to him in half-puzzled,
                                 half-sympathetic inquiry.

                              <p id="d44710e2069">“You are young, my child,” he replied, “to be so

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2072">“ 'Tain't that, sir,” said the boy slowly.  “I don't set
                                 much store by that.  But I've got to go to
                                 heaven—because I can't see Thomas Jefferson no

                              <p id="d44710e2075">The rector did not smile.  He was wiser than his
                                 generation, for he left the great man's own religion
                                 to himself and God.  He said merely:

                                 Juliet Burwell, and she fluttered across to him in all
                                 her mystifying flounces and her gracious smile.

                                 Her beauty took away his breath and made his
                                 pulses leap.  The slow, musical drawl of her speech
                                 soothed him like the runningrunning ofof clear water. He felt
                                 the image of Thomas Jefferson totter upon its
                                 pedestal, but it was steadied with a tremendous
                                 lurch.  Jefferson was a man, after all, and this was
                                 only a woman.

                                 stammered an amazed and awkward assent.

                                 and talk over the lesson for the following morning.
                                 At five o'clock in the afternoon he dressed himself
                                 with trembling hands and a perturbed heart; and for
                                 the first time in his life turned to look at his
                                 reflection in the small, cracked mirror hanging above
                                 the washstand in his stepmother's room.

                                 drew back to survey him, “but you've got as peart
                                 a face as I ever seed.  I reckon you'll be plenty
                                 handsome for a man.  I was al'ays kind of set

                                 They're pretty enough to look at when you're feelin'
                                 first-rate, but when you git the neuralgy they sort of
                                 turns yo' stomach.  I've a taste for sober colours in

                                 of gratitude, and silently resolved to save up until he
                                 had enough money to buy her a hair ribbon.

                                 green to the Burwell's house, which was in the lane
                                 called “Back Street,” he fell to a creeping pace,
                                 held back by the fluttering of his pulses.  Not until he
                                 saw Juliet standing at the little whitewashed gate
                                 did he brace himself to the full courage of
                                 approaching.  When he spoke her name she opened
                                 the gate and gave him her hand, while all sense of
                                 diffidence fell from him.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2129">“I've been looking at you for a long ways,” he
                                 said boldly, “an' you were just like one of them tall
                                 lilies bordering the walk.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2132">She blushed, turning her clear eyes upon him, and
                                 he felt a great desire to kiss the folds of her skirt or
                                 the rose above her left temple.  He had never seen
                                 any one so good or so kind or so beautiful, and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2134"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span>
                                 he vowed passionately in his rustic little heart that
                                 he would always love her best—best of all—that he
                                 would fight for her if he might, or work for her if
                                 she needed it.  There was none like her—not his
                                 stepmother—not Sairy Jane—not even Eugenia.
                                 She was different—something of finer clay, made
                                 to be waited upon and worshipped like the picture
                                 of the goddess standing on the moon that he had
                                 seen in the judge's study.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2138">Juliet smiled upon his ardour, and, leading him to a
                                 bench beneath a flowering myrtle, made him sit
                                 down beside her, while she spoke pious things about
                                 Adam and the catechism and the salvation of the
                                 world—to all of which he listened with wide-opened
                                 eyes and a fluttering heart.  He wondered why no
                                 one had ever before told him such beautiful things
                                 about God and the manifold importance of keeping a
                                 clean heart and loving your neighbour as yourself.  It
                                 seemed to him that he had been living in sin for the
                                 twelve years of his life and he feared that he should
                                 find it impossible to purge his mind of evil passions
                                 and to love the coloured boy Boss who had stolen
                                 his best fishing line.  He asked Juliet if she thought
                                 he would be able to withstand the assaults of Satan
                                 as the minister told him to do; but she laughed and
                                 said that there was no Satan who went about like a
                                 roaring lion—only cruelty and anger and ill-will,
                                 and that he must be kind to his brothers and sisters,
                                 and to animals, and not rob birds' nests, which was
                                 very wrong.  Then she added as an afterthought,
                                 with a saintly look in her eyes, that he must love
                                 God.  He promised that he should try to do so,
                                 though he wished in his heart that she had
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2140"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="87" data-tei-n="89"> </a></span>
                                 told him to love herself instead.  As he sat in the soft
                                 light, watching her beautiful face rising against a
                                 background of lilies, his young brain thrilled with the
                                 joy of life.  It was such a glorious thing to live in a
                                 great, kind world, with a big, beneficent God above
                                 the blue, and to love all mankind—not harbouring an
                                 angry thought or an ill feeling!  He looked into the
                                 kind eyes beside him and felt that he should like to
                                 be a saint or a minister—not a lawyer, which might
                                 be wicked after all.  Then he remembered the
                                 waxen-faced, choleric clergyman of the church his
                                 stepmother attended, but he put the memory away.
                                 No, he would not be like that; he would not preach
                                 fire and brimstone from a white-pine pulpit.  He
                                 would be large and just and merciful like God; and
                                 Juliet Burwell would come to hear him preach,
                                 looking up at him with her blue, blue glance.  In the
                                 meantime he would not rob that marsh hen's nest
                                 which he had found.  He would never steal another
                                 egg.  He wished that he didn't have that drawerful at
                                 home.  He would give them to Sairy Jane if she
                                 wanted them—all except the snake's egg, which he
                                 might keep, because serpents were an accursed
                                 race.  Yes, Sairy Jane might have them all, and he
                                 wouldn't pull her hair again when he caught her
                                 looking at them on the sly.

                              <p id="d44710e2143">Presently Juliet called Sally and took him into the
                                 quaint old dining-room and gave him cakes and jam
                                 on a table that shone like glass.  There he saw Mr.
                                 Burwell—a pink-checked, little gentleman who
                                 wore an expansive air of innocence and a white
                                 pique waistcoat—and Mrs. Burwell, a pretty, gray-haired

                                 velvet-pawed despotism which was the heritage of
                                 the women of her race and day.  She had never
                                 bought a bonnet without openly consulting his
                                 judgment; he had never taken a step in life without
                                 unconsciously following hers.

                                 heard of Nicholas's reception by his daughter,
                                 “Juliet must a—a—be taught to recognise the
                                 existence of class.  Really, I cannot have her
                                 bringing all these people into my house.  You must
                                 put a stop to it at once, my dear.”

                              <p id="d44710e2151">Mrs. Burwell had smiled placidly as she patted
                                 her gray fringe.

                              <p id="d44710e2154">“Of course you know best, Mr. Burwell,” she had
                                 replied with that touching humility which forbade her
                                 to address her husband by his Christian name.  “Of
                                 course you know best about such matters, and I'll
                                 tell Juliet what you say.  Poor child, she has such
                                 confidence in your judgment that she will believe
                                 whatever you say to be right; but she does love so
                                 to feel that she is exerting a good influence over the
                                 boys, and, perhaps, helping them to work out their
                                 future salvation.  She thinks, too, that it is so well for
                                 them to have a chance of talking to you.  I heard her
                                 tell Dudley Webb that he must take you for an example—”

                                 the ground his daughter trod upon.  “I
                                 suppose it would be a pity to interfere with her, eh,
                                 my dear?”

                                 Burr boy, and he seems to be a decent, respectful
                                 kind of child.  Of course I know it is your soft heart
                                 that makes you look at it in this way—but I love you
                                 all the better for it.  I remember the day you
                                 proposed to me for the sixth time, I had just seen
                                 you bandage up the head of a little darkey that had
                                 cut himself—and I accepted you on the spot.”

                                 kissing his wife as they left the room.  “I am
                                 convinced that I am right, and I am glad that you
                                 agree with me.  We won't speak of it to Juliet.”

                                 was not speaking of heaven now.  She was laughing
                                 merrily at pointless jokes and promising to
                                 embroider a handkerchief for one and to make a

                                 become ministers for her sake, as he was going to

                                 her hand upon his arm.  “He has promised not to rob
                                 birds' nests and to love me always,” she said.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e2190">“Ask something harder,” retorted one.  “Any of
                                 us will do that.  Ask him to stand on his head or to
                                 tie himself into a bow knot for your sake.”

                              <p id="d44710e2193">Nicholas reddened angrily, but Juliet told the
                                 jester to try such experiments himself—that she did
                                 not want a contortionist about.  Then she bent over
                                 the boy as he said good-bye, and he went down the
                                 walk between the lilies and out into the lane.

                              <p id="d44710e2196">He recrossed the green slowly, turning into the
                                 main street at the court-house steps.  As he passed
                                 the church, a little further on, the iron gate opened
                                 and the rector came out, jingling the heavy keys in
                                 his hand as he talked amicably to a tourist who
                                 followed upon his heels.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2200">“Yes, my good sir,” he was saying in his
                                 high-pitched, emphatic utterance, “this dear old
                                 churchyard is never mowed except by living lawn-mowers.
                                 I assure you that I have seen thirty heads
                                 of cattle upon the vaults—positively, thirty heads,

                              <p id="d44710e2203">But the boy's thoughts were far from the church
                                 and its rector, and the words sifted rapidly through
                                 his brain.  He touched his hat at the tourist's greeting
                                 and smiled into the clergyman's face, but his actions
                                 were automatic.  He would have nodded to the
                                 horse in the street or have smiled at the sun.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2206">As he passed the small shops fronting on the
                                 narrow sidewalk and followed the whitewashed
                                 fence of the college grounds until it ended at the
                                 Old Stage Road, he was conscious of the keen, pulsating
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2208"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="91" data-tei-n="93"> </a></span>
                                 harmony of life.  It was good to be alive—to feel the
                                 warm sunshine overhead and the warm dust below.
                                 He was glad that he had been born, though the idea
                                 had never formulated itself until now.  He would be
                                 very good all his life and never do a wicked thing.  It
                                 was so easy to be good if you only wanted to.  Yes,
                                 he would study hard and become learned in the law,
                                 like those old prophets with whom God spoke as
                                 man with man.  Then, when he had grown better and
                                 wiser than any one on earth, his tongue would
                                 become loosened, and he would go forth to preach
                                 the Gospel, and Juliet would listen to him for his
                                 wisdom's sake.  Oh, if she would only love him
                                 best—best of all!

                                 frighten him, though the sun was down.  He thought
                                 neither of the ghosts that Uncle Dan'l had seen, nor
                                 of the bug-a-boos that had chased Viney's husband
                                 home.  He was too old for these things now.  He had
                                 grown taller and stronger in a day.  When he
                                 reached the pasture gate opposite the house he
                                 opened it and went in to look for the sheep.

                              <p id="d44710e2214">The west was fast losing colour, like a bright-hued
                                 fabric that has been drenched in water, and a thick,
                                 blue mist, shot with fireflies, shrouded the wide
                                 common.  A fresh, sharp odour rose from the dew-steeped
                                 earth, giving place, as he gained upon the
                                 flock, to the smell of moist wool.  As he brushed the
                                 heavy, purple tubes of Jamestown weeds
                                 long-legged insects flew out and struck against his
                                 arm before they fell in a drunken stupor to the grass
                                 below.

                                 the far-off horizon clouds of lavender were melting,
                                 and the pines had gone gray.

                                 the pasture, and he began to call softly:

                                 flock it scattered swiftly, the errant leaders darting
                                 shyly behind the looming outlines of sassafras
                                 bushes. Again he called, and again the plaintive cry
                                 responded, growing fainter as several fleeter ewes
                                 sped past him to the beech trees beside the little
                                 stream.

                                 with fireflies, and the mist grew denser.

                              <p id="d44710e2235">He broke off a branch of sassafras and started at
                                 a brisk run, rounding by some dozen yards the
                                 startled ewes. The scattered white blotches closed
                                 together as he ran towards them, and fled, bleating,
                                 to the flock where it clustered at the pasture gate.

                                 and nervous, was putting salted herring to soak in
                                 an earthenware bowl, while she scolded Sairy Jane,
                                 who was patching Jubal's apron.

                                 looked at him fixedly. For a moment he did not
                                 speak, and then he said slowly:

                              <p id="d44710e2274">He was thinking doggedly that he had never
                                 hated any one so much as he hated his own father,
                                 and that he liked the sensation. He wished he could
                                 do him some real harm—hit him hard enough to
                                 hurt or make the peanuts rot in the ground. He
                                 should like also to choke Jubal, who never left off
                                 yelling.

                                 through the open window, flinching before the boy's
                                 steady glance. He was a mild-natured man at best,
                                 whose chief sin was his softness. It would not have
                                 entered his slow-witted head to protest against the
                                 accusations of his wife. When they stung him into
                                 revolt he revolted in the opposite direction.

                              <p id="d44710e2280">But his failures were faults in his son's eyes. To
                                 the desperate determination of the boy, weakness
                                 became as contemptible as crime. What was a man
                                 worth who worked from morning until night and yet
                                 achieved nothing? Of what account was the farmer
                                 whom the crows outwitted and the weather made a
                                 mockery? Did not the very crops cry out as they
                                 rotted that his father was a fool, and the unploughed
                                 land proclaim him a coward? Had he ever dared a
                                 venture in his life or risked a season? And yet what
                                 had ever returned at his bidding or brought forth at
                                 his planting?

                                 was her own flesh and blood kin. Sairy Jane, you

                              <p id="d44710e2292">Nicholas sat down, but the cornbread stuck in his
                                 throat and the coffee was without aroma. He looked at
                                 the figured oilcloth on the table and thought of the
                                 shining glass and silver at Juliet Burwell's. The flavour
                                 of the cake she had given him seemed to intensify his
                                 distaste for the food before him. He felt that he cared
                                 for nobody—that he wanted nothing. He looked at his
                                 stepmother and thought that she was dried and brown
                                 like a hickory nut; I he looked at Sairy Jane and
                                 wondered why she didn't have any eyelashes, and he
                                 looked at Jubal and saw that he was all gums.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2295">When he went up to his little attic room after
                                 supper he sat on his shucks pallet in the darkness
                                 and thought of all the evil that he should like to do.
                                 He should like to pull Sairy Jane's plait and to slap
                                 Jubal. He should even like to tell Juliet Burwell that
                                 he didn't want to keep a clean heart, and to call God
                                 names. No, he would not become a minister and
                                 preach the Gospel. He would be a thief instead and
                                 break into hen-houses and steal chickens. If his
                                 father planted watermelons he would steal them
                                 from the vines as soon as they were ripe. Perhaps
                                 Eugenia would help him. At any rate he would go
                                 halves with her if she would be his partner in wickedness.

                                 He had just as soon go to hell, after all—if it
                                 were not for Thomas Jefferson.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2300">He leaned his head on his hands and looked
                                 through the narrow window to where the peanut
                                 fields lay in blackness. From the stable came the
                                 faint neigh of the old mare, and he remembered
                                 suddenly that he had forgotten to put straw in her
                                 stall and to loosen her halter that she might lie
                                 down. He rose and stole softly downstairs and
                                 out of the house.

                                 Delphy's cabin after supper and found Eugenia
                                 seated upon the hearth, facing Uncle Ish and Aunt
                                 Verbeny. Between them Delphy's son-in-law,
                                 Moses, was helping Bernard mend a broken hare
                                 trap, while Delphy, herself, was crooning a lullaby to
                                 one of her grandchildren as she carded the wool
                                 which she had taken from a quilt of faded
                                 patchwork. On the stones of the great fireplace the
                                 red flames from lightwood splits leaped over a
                                 smouldering hickory log, filling the cabin with the
                                 penetrating odour of burning, resinous pine.  From
                                 the wall above the hearth a dozen roasting apples
                                 were suspended by hemp strings, and as the heat
                                 penetrated the russet coats the apples circled
                                 against the yawning chimney like small globes
                                 revolving about a sun.

                                 split-bottomed chair, her hands folded in her lap and her
                                 animated eyes on the dark faces across from her,
                                 over whose wrinkled surfaces the dancing firelight
                                 chased in ruddy lights and shadows.

                              <p id="d44710e2318">Uncle Ish had stretched his feet out upon the
                                 stones, and the mud adhering to his rough,
                                 homemade boots was fast drying before the blaze
                                 and settling in coarse gray dust upon the hearth. His
                                 gnarled old palms lay upward on his knees, and his
                                 grizzled head was bowed upon his chest. At intervals
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2320"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="100"> </a></span>
                                 he muttered softly to himself, but his words
                                 were inaudible—suggested by some far-off and
                                 disconnected vision Aunt Verbeny was nodding in
                                 her chair, arousing herself from time to time to give
                                 a sharp glance into the face of Uncle Ish.

                                 asked Delphy suddenly, turning her eyes upon
                                 Eugenia as she drew a fresh handful of wool from
                                 between the covers of the quilt.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2327">“I ran away,” replied the child gravely. “I saw

                              <p id="d44710e2330">“Yes, I shall,” rejoined Bernard without looking
                                 up from his trap. “You can't wear breeches.”

                                 Eugenia. “I put on a pair of your old ones and they fit
                                 me just as well as they do you—only Aunt Chris
                                 made me get out of them.”

                              <p id="d44710e2336">“Sakes er live!” exclaimed Aunt Verbeny,
                                 awaking from her doze.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2339">Uncle Ish stared dreamily into the flames. “Ole

                                 while Delphy looked at him and shook her head
                                 mysteriously.

                              <p id="d44710e2342">Then, as Nicholas entered, they made a place for
                                 him upon the hearthstones, treating him with the

                                 rather than individual, the consolation attained might
                                 be considered disproportionate to the needs of the
                                 case.  The lines of her present had fallen in a white
                                 frame house in the main street of Kingsborough;
                                 those of her past began with the first Dudley who
                                 swung a lance in Merry England, to end with
                                 irascible old William of the name, who slept in the
                                 family graveyard upon James River.

                              <p id="d44710e2560">Mrs. Webb herself was straight and elegant, and
                                 inclined to the ironical, when, as Jane Dudley, the
                                 belle of the country-side, she fired the fancy of
                                 young Julius Webb, an officer in the cavalry of the
                                 United States.  He danced a minuet with her at a
                                 ball in Washington, was heard to swear an oath by
                                 her eyes at punch before the supper was over; and
                                 proceeded the following week to spur his courtship
                                 upon old William as daringly as he had ever spurred
                                 his horse upon an Indian wigwam.

                              <p id="d44710e2565">The last Dudley of the Virginian line withstood,
                                 through several stormy years, the united appeals of his
                                 daughter and her lover.  In the end he yielded, subdued
                                 by opposition and gout, retaining the strength to insert
                                 but a single stipulation in the marriage contract, to the
                                 effect that his daughter should drop the name of Jane
                                 and be known as Dudley in her husband's household.  To
                                 this the dashing bridegroom acquiesced with readiness,
                                 and when, within a year of the wedding, his wife
                                 presented him with a son, he called the boy, as he called
                                 the mother, by her maiden name.

                              <p id="d44710e2569">He was a jovial young buck, who lived in his cards
                                 and his cups and loathed a quarrel as he loved a fight.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2572">When the war between the States arose he went with
                                 Virginia, caring little for either cause, but conscious that
                                 his heart was where his home was.  So he kissed the
                                 young mother and the boy at her side and rode lightly
                                 away with a laugh upon his lips, to fall as lightly in the
                                 mad charge of cavalry at Brandy Station.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2575">When the news came Jane Dudley listened to it in
                                 silence, her hands clasping the worsteds she was
                                 winding.  After the words were spoken she laid the
                                 worsteds carefully aside, stooping to pick up a fallen ball.
                                 Then she crossed the room and went upstairs.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2578">She said little, refusing herself alike to consolation and
                                 to acquaintances, spending her days in the shuttered
                                 house with her boy beside her.  When he fretted at the
                                 restraint she tied a band of crepe on his little jacket and
                                 sent him to play on the green, while she took up her
                                 worsteds again and finished
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2580"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="108" data-tei-n="113"> </a></span>
                                 the muffler she had been crocheting.  If she wept it was
                                 in secret, when the lights were out.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2583">Some years later the house was sold over her head,
                                 but when she stood, penniless, upon the threshold it was
                                 to cross it as haughtily as she had done as a bride.  The
                                 stiff folds of her black silk showed no wavering ripple,
                                 the repose of her lips betrayed no tremor.  The smooth,
                                 high pompadour of her black hair passed as proudly
                                 beneath the arched doorway as it had done in the days
                                 of her wifehood and Julius Webb.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2586">Her neighbours opened their wasted stores to her
                                 need, and out of their poverty offered her abundance,
                                 but she put aside their proffered assistance and
                                 undertook, unaided, the support and education of her
                                 child, maintaining throughout the struggle her air of
                                 unflinching irony.  She moved into a small white frame
                                 house opposite the church, and let out her spare rooms
                                 to student boarders.  Her pride was never lowered and her
                                 crepe was never laid aside.  She sat up far into the night
                                 to darn the sleeves of her black silk gown, but the
                                 stitches were of such exquisite fineness that in the dim
                                 light of her drawing-room they seemed but an added
                                 gloss.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2590">From behind the massive coffee urn at the head of her
                                 table she regarded her boarders as so many beneficiaries
                                 upon her bounty.  When she passed a cup of coffee she
                                 seemed to confer an honour; when she returned a
                                 receipted bill it was as if she repulsed an insult.  People
                                 said that she had been born to greatness and that she
                                 had never adapted herself to the obscurity that had been
                                 thrust upon her—but they said it when her back was
                                 turned.  To her face
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e2592"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="109" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span>
                                 the subject was never broached, and her former
                                 prosperity was ignored along with her present
                                 poverty.  Of her own sorrows she, herself, made no
                                 mention.  When she spoke from the depths of her
                                 bitterness of the war and the ruin it had left, her
                                 resentment was general rather than personal.  Above
                                 the mantel in her room hung the sword of Julius
                                 Webb, sheathed under the tattered colours of the
                                 Confederate States.  At her throat she wore a button
                                 that had been cut from a gray coat, and, once, after
                                 the close of the war, she had pointed to it before a
                                 Federal officer, and had said: “Sir, the women of
                                 the South have never surrendered!”  The officer had
                                 looked at the face above the button as he answered:
                                 “Madam, had the women of the South fought its
                                 battles, surrender would have been for the men of
                                 the North.”  But Jane Webb had smiled bitterly in
                                 silence.  To her the Federal officer was but an
                                 individual member of a national army of invasion,
                                 and the rights of the victors, the wrongs of Virginia.

                                 solitary revolt.  When young Dudley grew old

                                 to unite in admiration of one who was wanting in the
                                 supremest of the feminine virtues.  His code was an
                                 obvious one, and he had never seen cause to depart
                                 from it.

                                 self-possession.  “Well, well, there's no telling,” he said;
                                 “but he's as bright as a steel trap.  I wish Tom had half his
                                 sense.”  Then he turned past the church on his way
                                 home, and the general, declining an invitation to dinner,
                                 went on to the post-office, where he awaited his carriage.

                                 judge's house and became the popular tyrant of his little
                                 schoolroom.  He was a dark, high-bred looking boy, with
                                 a rich voice and a nature that was generous in small
                                 things and selfish in large ones.  There was a convincing
                                 air of good-fellowship about him, which won the honest
                                 heart of slow-witted Tom Bassett, and a half-veiled
                                 regard for his own youthful pleasures, which aroused the
                                 wrath of Eugenia.

                                 the schoolroom and took his place upon one of the short
                                 green benches, Mrs. Webb called upon the judge in
                                 person and demanded an explanation.

                                 quailing—a surrender of the flesh, not the spirit.

                                 doesn't care a—a—pardon me, madam—a continental
                                 whether anybody else is his inferior or not.  No

                                 and his words wavered, but his will did not.  In his
                                 attitude his respect for her sexually and individually
                                 was expressed, but he had argued the opposing
                                 interests in his mind, and his decision was judicial.

                                 stiff skirt and departed with folded lips.

                                 nervously for a half-hour, giving uncertain glances
                                 towards the hall door, as if he expected the advent
                                 of an incarnate thunderbolt.  In the afternoon he sent
                                 over a bottle of his best Madeira as a peace-offering.
                                 Mrs. Webb acknowledged the Madeira,
                                 not the truce.  The following day General Battle

                                 tones the withdrawal of Amos Burr's son.  He
                                 looked excited and somewhat alarmed, and the
                                 judge recognised the hand of the player.

                              <p id="d44710e2775">“But as I said to my wife,” continued Mr. Burwell with
                                 convincing earnestness, “these matters had best be left
                                 to men.  There is no need for our wives and daughters to
                                 be troubled by them.  It is for us, who are acquainted with
                                 the world and who have had wide experience, to settle all
                                 social barriers.”

                              <p id="d44710e2778">The judge agreed as before.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e2781">“I am glad to say that my wife takes my view of it,” the
                                 other went on.  “Indeed, I think she has expressed what I
                                 have said to Mrs. Webb.”

                                 bowing.

                              <p id="d44710e2788">Then Mr. Burwell left, and the judge spent another half-hour
                                 walking up and down his study floor.  He had gained
                                 the victory, but he would have felt pleasanter had it been
                                 defeat.  It was as if he had taken some secret advantage of
                                 a woman—of a widow.

                                 it lay in the judge's power to settle with circumstances,
                                 and each morning during the school term Mrs. Webb
                                 frowned down upon his hurrying figure as it sped along
                                 the street and turned the corner at the palace green.
                                 Sometimes, when snow was falling, he would shoot by
                                 like an arrow, and Dudley would say with quick compassion, as he

                                 looked up from his steaming cakes: “It's because he
                                 hasn't any overcoat, mother.  He runs to keep warm.”
                              </p>

                                 Dudley went to King's College for a couple of years,
                                 while Nicholas returned to the farm.  The judge still
                                 befriended him, and the contents of Tom's class books
                                 found their way into his head sooner or later, with more
                                 information than Tom's brain could hold.  One of the
                                 instructors at the college—a consumptive young fellow,
                                 whose ambitions had leaned towards the bar—gave the
                                 boy what assistance he needed, and when the work of
                                 the class-room and the farm was over, the two would
                                 meet in the dim old library of the college and plod
                                 through heavy, discoloured pages, while the portraits of
                                 painted aristocrats glowered down upon the intrusive
                                 plebeian.

                              <p id="d44710e2802">Despite the hard labour of spring ploughing and the
                                 cold of early winter dawns, when he was up and out of
                                 doors, the years passed happily enough.  He beheld the
                                 future through the visions of an imaginative mind, and it
                                 seemed big with promise.  Sitting in the quaint old library,
                                 surrounded by faded relics and colourless traditions, he
                                 felt the breath of hushed oratory in the air, and political
                                 passion stirred in the surrounding dust.  There was a
                                 niche in a small alcove, where he spent the spare hours of
                                 many a day, the words of great, long-gone Virginians
                                 lying before him; behind him, through the small square
                                 window, all the blue-green sweep of the college grounds
                                 ending where the Old Stage Road led on to his father's farm.

                                 with the wistful eyes of one who sees another
                                 striving where he has striven and failed.  The
                                 students met him with tolerant hilarity, and Tom
                                 Bassett, who would have kicked the Declaration of
                                 Independence across the campus in lieu of a ball,
                                 watched him with secret mirth and open
                                 championship.  There had sprung up a strong
                                 friendship between the two—one of those rare
                                 affections which bend but do not break.  Dudley
                                 Webb, the most brilliant member of his class and the
                                 light of his mother's eyes, began life, as he would
                                 end it, with the ready grasp of good-fellowship.  He
                                 had long since outgrown his artificial, childish
                                 distrust of Nicholas, and he had as long ago
                                 forgotten that he had ever entertained it.  As for
                                 Nicholas himself, he had not forgotten it, but the
                                 memory was of little moment.  He had a work to do
                                 in life, and he did it as best he might.  If it were the
                                 ploughing of rocky soil, so much the worse; if the
                                 uprooting of dead men's thoughts, so much the
                                 better.  He slighted neither the one nor the other.

                                 rather than the student.  His hair had darkened to a
                                 less flaming red, his eyes had grown brighter, and
                                 the freckles had faded into a general gray tone of
                                 complexion.

                                 of youthful vanity, “but it is the ugliness that
                                 attracts.”

                                 words would have left a sting.  He possessed an
                                 inherent regard for physical perfection, rendered the
                                 greater by his own tormented childhood.  He was
                                 strong and vigorous and of well-knit sinews, but he
                                 would have given his muscle for Dudley Webb's
                                 hands and his brains for the other's hair.

                              <p id="d44710e2822">Once, as a half-grown boy, in a fit of jealousy
                                 inspired by Dudley's good looks, he had called him
                                 “Miss Nancy,” and knocked him down.  When his
                                 enemy had lain at his feet on the green he had
                                 raised him up and made amends by standing
                                 motionless while Dudley lashed him with a small
                                 riding-whip.  The jealousy had vanished since then,
                                 but the smart was still there.

                                 sent for him and offered to take him into his office
                                 while he prepared himself for the bar.

                                 lingered for a moment in the narrow walk.  His head
                                 was bent, and the books which he carried under his
                                 arm were pressed against his side.  They seemed to
                                 contain all that was needed for the making of his
                                 future—those books and his impatient mind.  His
                                 success was as assured as if he held it already in
                                 the hollow of his hand—and with success would
                                 come honour and happiness and all that was desired
                                 of man.  It seemed to him that his lot was the one of
                                 all others which he would have chosen of his free
                                 and untrammelled will.  To strive and to win; to
                                 surmount all obstacles by the determined dash of
                                 ambition; to rise from obscurity unto prominence
                                 through the sheer forces that make for
                                 power—what was better than this?

                              <p id="d44710e2843">Still plunged in thought, he passed the church and
                                 followed the street to the Old Stage Road.  From the
                                 college dormitories a group of students sang out a
                                 greeting, and he responded impulsively, tossing his
                                 hat in the air.  In his face a glow had risen,
                                 harmonising his inharmonious features.  He felt as a
                                 man feels who stands before a closed door and
                                 knows that he has but to cross the threshold to
                                 grasp the fulness of his aspiration.  Yes, to-day he
                                 envied no one—neither Tom Bassett nor Dudley
                                 Webb, neither the general nor the judge.  He held

                                 the books tightly under his arm and smiled down
                                 upon the road.  His clumsy, store-made boots left
                                 heavy tracks in the dust, but he seemed to be
                                 treading air.

                                 day in early November, and the clouds were swollen
                                 with incoming autumnal rains. The open country
                                 stretched before him in monotonous grays, the long
                                 road gleaming pallid in the general drab of the
                                 landscape.  As he passed along, holding his hat in his
                                 hand, his uplifted head struck the single,
                                 high-coloured note in the picture—all else was dull
                                 and leaden.

                                 and Nicholas stopped to remark upon the outlook.
                                 The farmer, a thickset, hairy man, whose name was
                                 Turner, gave a sudden hitch to the halter to check
                                 the progress of the cow, and nodded ominously.

                                 that thar oak turns its leaves.  It's a bad sign, and if

                                 where the clouds hung heavily above the pines.

                                 across her face.  A brown-and-white pointer ran at
                                 her side.

                                 Her eyes shone as she looked at him.  There
                                 was a singular brilliance of expression in her face,
                                 due partly to the exercise, partly to the restless
                                 animation of her features.  She was at the

                                 into the Old Stage Road, and the clatter of the hoofs
                                 was gone.  When the stillness had fallen again he
                                 went slowly on his way.

                              <p id="d44710e3288">In the woods the pale bodies of the beeches
                                 seemed to melt into the cloudy atmosphere.  There
                                 was no wind among the trees, and the pervading
                                 dampness had robbed the yellowed leaves of their
                                 silken rustle.  They fluttered softly, hanging limp
                                 from the drooping branches as if attached by
                                 invisible threads.  As he went on a deep bluish
                                 smoke issued from among some far-off poplars
                                 where a farmer was burning brush in a clearing.
                                 The smoke hung low above the undergrowth,
                                 assuming eccentric outlines and varied tones of
                                 dusk.  Presently the fires glimmered nearer, and he
                                 saw the red tongues of the flames and heard the
                                 parched crackling of consuming leaves.  The figures
                                 of the workers were limned grotesquely against the
                                 ruddy background with a startling and unreal
                                 absence of detail.  They looked like incarnate
                                 shadows—stalking between the dim beeches and
                                 the blazing brush heaps.  A few drops of rain fell
                                 suddenly, and the fires began slowly to die away.  At

                                 mournfully.  Later they would be hauled away to
                                 assist in the winter dressing of the fallows; now
                                 they beat helplessly against the retarding rails like a
                                 vanquished army of invasion.

                                 broomsedge on his way to the house.  Beyond the
                                 barnyard he saw the long rows of pine staves that
                                 had supported the shocks of peanuts, and from the
                                 direction of the field he caught sight of his father,
                                 driven homeward by the threatening rain.

                                 before the cloudburst.  She was a lank, colourless
                                 girl, with bad teeth and small pale eyes.  Jubal, at the

                                 entered, and grinned as he pointed to his mother in
                                 the kitchen.  Marthy Burr was ironing.  As Nicholas
                                 crossed the threshold, she stopped in her passage
                                 from the stove and looked at him, a flash of pride
                                 softening her pain-scarred features.

                                 but he let it lie.  He was watching his father's jaws
                                 as they rose and fell over the quid of tobacco.

                                 “Give me time.  I'll pay it all in time.”  Then the sound
                                 of Sairy Jane's sobs maddened him and he turned
                                 upon her with an oath.  “Damn you!  Can't you be
                                 quiet?”

                                 voice broke suddenly.  “Go ahead an' make a man
                                 of yo'self, mortgage or no mortgage.”

                                 into his stepmother's face.  Then he looked at her
                                 hand as it lay upon his arm.  That trembling hand
                                 brought to him more fully than words, more clearly
                                 than visions, the pathos of her life.

                              <p id="d44710e3449">“Don't you worry, ma,” he said quietly at last.
                                 “It'll be all right.  Don't you worry.”

                              <p id="d44710e3452">Then he let her hand slip from his shoulder and
                                 left the room.

                              <p id="d44710e3455">He passed out upon the back porch and stood
                                 gazing vacantly across the outlook.

                              <p id="d44710e3458">It rained heavily, the drops descending in
                                 horizontal lengths like a fantastic fall of colourless
                                 pine needles.  Overhead the clouds were black,
                                 impenetrable.

                              <p id="d44710e3461">Through the falling rain he looked at the view
                                 before him, at the overgrown yard, at the manure
                                 heaps near the stable, at the grim rows of staves in
                                 the peanut field, at the sombre and deserted
                                 landscape.  A raw wind blew in gusts from the
                                 northeast, and the distorted ailanthus tree in the yard
                                 moaned and wrung its twisted limbs.  Sharp,
                                 unpleasant odours came from the pig-pen in the
                                 barnyard, where the rain was scattering the slops in
                                 the trough.  A bull bellowed in a far-off pasture.
                                 Before the hen-house door several dripping fowls
                                 strutted with wilted feathers.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3464">He saw it all in silence, with the dogged eyes of
                                 one whose gaze is turned inward.  He made no
                                 gesture, uttered no exclamation.  He was as
                                 motionless as the lintel of the door on which he
                                 leaned.

                                 face.  He turned, reentered the house, closed the
                                 door carefully, and went upstairs.

                                 take advantage of it.”  He spoke in set phrases, as if
                                 he had rehearsed the sentences many times.

                                 “Why, what business is going on in Kingsborough?”

                                 formed on the palace green.  Straight ahead the lane
                                 of maples stretched like a line of half-extinguished
                                 fires, and the ground beneath was strewn with wet,
                                 red leaves.  The slanting sheets of rain gave a
                                 sombre aspect to the town—to the time-beaten
                                 buildings along the unpaved streets and to the

                                 reminiscent of a yesterday that was perished; the
                                 red, wet leaves painted the brown earth in historic
                                 colours.

                                 passed on to Jerry Pollard's store—a long, low
                                 structure fronting on the main street—and entered
                                 by a single step from the sidewalk.  The show
                                 windows on either side the entrance displayed a
                                 motley selection from the varied assortment of a
                                 “general” store—cheap silks and high-coloured
                                 calicos, men's shirts and women's shoes, cravats
                                 and hairpins, suspenders and corsets.  On the
                                 sidewalk near the doorway there was a baby
                                 carriage, a saddle, and a collection of farming
                                 implements.  As Nicholas crossed the threshold a
                                 pink-cheeked girl passed him, her arms filled with
                                 bundles, and at the counter an old negro woman
                                 was pricing red flannel.

                              <p id="d44710e3563">Jerry Pollard, a coarse-featured, full-bearded man
                                 of sixty years, was behind the counter.  Nicholas
                                 caught his persuasive tones as he leaned over,
                                 holding the end of the bolt of flannel in his hands.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3566">“Now, look here, Aunty, you ain't going to find
                                 such a bargain as this anywhere else in town.  Take
                                 my oath on that.  Every thread wool and forty-four
                                 inches wide.  Only thirty cents a yard, too.  I got it at
                                 an auction in Richmond, or I couldn't let it go at
                                 double that price.  How much?  All right.”

                              <p id="d44710e3569">The flannel was measured off with skilful
                                 manipulations of the yardstick and the scissors, the parcel

                                 was handed to the old negro woman, and the
                                 change was dropped into the till.  Then Jerry Pollard
                                 came from behind the counter and slapped Nicholas
                                 upon the shoulder.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3575">“Hello, my boy!” he said.  “So your pa has taken
                                 me at my word, and here you are.  Well, Jerry
                                 Pollard's word's his bond, and he ain't going back on
                                 it.  So, when you feel like it, you can step right in and
                                 get to business.  When'll you begin?  Today?  No
                                 time like the present time's my motto.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3578">“To-morrow!” returned Nicholas hastily.  “I've
                                 got some things to wind up.  I'll come to-morrow.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3581">“All right.  I'm your man.  To-morrow at seven
                                 sharp?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3584">Then a purchaser appeared, and Jerry Pollard
                                 went forward, his business smile returning to his
                                 face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3587">The purchaser was Mrs. Burwell, and, as
                                 Nicholas passed out, she looked up from a pair of
                                 waffle-irons she was selecting and nodded
                                 pleasantly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3590">“I am glad to see you, Nicholas,” she said.
                                 “Juliet was asking after you in her last letter.  You
                                 were always a favourite of Juliet's.  I was telling
                                 Mr. Burwell so only last night.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3594">“She was very kind,” returned Nicholas, and
                                 added: “Is Miss Juliet—Mrs. Galt well?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3597">Juliet Burwell had married five years before, and
                                 he had not seen her since.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3600">Mrs. Burwell nodded cheerily.  She was still fresh
                                 and youthful, her pink cheeks and bright eyes giving
                                 the gray of her hair the effect of powder sprinkled
                                 on her brown fringe.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e3605">“Yes, Juliet is well,” she answered.  “They are
                                 living in Richmond now.  Mr. Galt had to give up his
                                 practice in New York because the climate did not
                                 suit Juliet's health.  I told him she couldn't stand
                                 transplanting to the north, and I was right.  They had
                                 to move south again.  Yes, Mr. Pollard, the middle-size
                                 irons, please.  I think they'll fit my stove.  If they
                                 don't, I'll exchange them for the small ones.  What
                                 did you say, Nicholas?  Oh!  good-morning.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3608">She turned away, and Nicholas stepped over her
                                 dripping umbrella and went out into the rain.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3612">When he was once outside he shook the water
                                 from his shoulders and walked rapidly in the
                                 direction of the old brick court-house, isolated upon
                                 the larger green.  The door and windows were
                                 closed, but he ascended the stone steps and stood
                                 beneath the portico, looking back upon the way that
                                 he had come.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3615">The street was deserted, save for a solitary
                                 oxcart rolling heavily through the mud.  In the
                                 distance the gray drops made a sombre veil, through
                                 which the foliage of King's College showed in a
                                 blurred discolouration.  From the branches of trees a
                                 double fall of water descended with a melancholy
                                 sound.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3618">Presently the ox-cart neared him, and the driver
                                 nodded, eyeing him with apathetic interest.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3621">When the cart had passed Nicholas came down
                                 the steps and started up the street at the same rapid
                                 walk.  He was not thinking of his way, but the
                                 impulse of action had seized upon him, and he was
                                 walking down the ferment in his brain.  He did not
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3623"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="139" data-tei-n="144"> </a></span>
                                 formulate the thought that with bodily fatigue would
                                 come mental indifference; he merely felt that when he was
                                 tired—dead tired—he would go home and sit down to
                                 dinner and face his father and discuss Jerry Pollard's
                                 terms.  He would do that when he was too tired to
                                 care—not before.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3626">When he reached the heavy iron gate of the college he
                                 swung it open and entered the grounds.  In the centre of
                                 the walk stood the statue of a great Colonial governor,
                                 and he paused before it for an instant, staring up into the
                                 battered features of the marble face.  He realised suddenly
                                 that he had never looked at it before.  Daily, for twelve
                                 years, he had passed the college campus, sometimes
                                 crossing it so that he might have brushed the effigy of
                                 the great Englishman with a careless hand—but he had
                                 never seen the face before.  Then he looked through the
                                 falling rain at the deserted archway of the old brick
                                 building.  For the first time those grim walls, which had
                                 been thrice overthrown and had arisen thrice from their
                                 ashes, impressed him with the triumphant service they
                                 had rendered in the culture of his kind.  He saw it as it
                                 was—a sacred skeleton, an honourable decay.  The long
                                 line of illustrious hands that had procured its ancient
                                 charter seemed to wave a ghostly benediction over its
                                 ancient learning.  Clergy and burgesses, council and
                                 governor, planters of Virginia and bishops of London had
                                 stood by its birth.  It was the fruit of the union of the old
                                 world and the new, and it had waxed strong upon the milk
                                 of its mother ere it turned rebel.  Later, to its younger
                                 country, it had sent forth its sons as statesmen who gave
                                 glory to its name.  And through
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3628"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="140" data-tei-n="145"> </a></span>
                                 all its history it had overcome calamity and defied
                                 assault.  Thrice it had fallen and thrice it had re-arisen.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3631">He recalled next the sheltered alcove in the dim library,
                                 where he had studied with the consumptive young
                                 instructor, who was dead.  The creepers upon the wall
                                 were encroaching stealthily upon the alcove window.
                                 Scarlet tendrils, like forked flames, licked the narrow
                                 ledge.  Several wet sparrows fluttered in and out among
                                 the leaves.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3635">He turned hastily away, passed the great Englishman
                                 with unseeing eyes, clanged the iron gate heavily behind
                                 him, and went on towards the house of his father.

                              <p id="d44710e3638">The family were at dinner when he entered, and he
                                 took his seat silently in the empty chair at his
                                 stepmother's right hand.
                              </p>

                                 sleeve.

                                 said.  “Anybody'd think you'd been layin' out in the rain
                                 all night.  You go up and change your clothes an' I'll keep

                                 came down his father had gone to the stable and his
                                 stepmother was alone in the kitchen.

                              <p id="d44710e3650">She brought him his dinner, standing beside the table
                                 while he ate it, watching him with an intentness that was
                                 almost wistful.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3654">“Would you like some molasses on your corn pone?”
                                 she asked as he finished and pushed his plate away.
                                 Then, as he shook his head, she added hesitatingly, “It
                                 come from Jerry Pollard's store.”

                              <p id="d44710e3659">But he only shook his head again, following with his
                                 eyes the wave-like design on the mahogany-coloured
                                 oilcloth that covered the table.

                                 stores anywhar 'bouts,” she said suddenly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3668">Nicholas looked up quickly and met her eyes.  She was
                                 holding a dish of baked potatoes in one hand and the
                                 other was resting for support upon the edge of the table.
                                 Her face was yellow and interlined, and a faint odour of
                                 camphor came from the bandage about her cheek.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3672">“Yes,” he replied indifferently.  “He does a very good
                                 business.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3675">His stepmother put the dish of potatoes back upon the
                                 table and took up the pitcher of buttermilk.  Her hand was
                                 trembling nervously.  There was a slight gasp in her voice
                                 when she spoke.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3678">“I don't know but what it's as big a thing to be in a
                                 fine store like that as 'tis to be a lawyer,” she said.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3681">For a moment Nicholas did not answer.  His eyes grew
                                 darker as she stood before him, and a shadow closed
                                 upon his face.  As in a frame, he saw the outline of her
                                 figure defined against the square of falling rain between
                                 the window sashes.  Her shoulders, bent slightly forward
                                 as if crushed by the bearing of heavy burdens, reminded
                                 him of a domestic animal full of years and labour.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3684">His face softened and he smiled into her eyes.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3687">“Yes, I don't know but what it is just as well,” he
                                 responded cheerfully.
                              </p>
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3691"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="142" data-tei-n="147"> </a></span>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3693">The next day he went into Jerry Pollard's store and
                                 began his winter's work.  He measured off un-bleached
                                 cotton cloth for a servant girl; sold a pair of shoes to a
                                 farmer, a cravat to a young fellow from the grocery shop
                                 next door, and a set of garden tools to an elderly lady
                                 who lived in the street facing the asylum and had a
                                 greenhouse.  At odd times he looked over Jerry Pollard's
                                 books, and after dark he dunned several debtors for
                                 unpaid bills.  He did it quietly and thoroughly, neither
                                 shirking nor over-elaborating the minutest detail.  There
                                 are men who have an immense capacity for taking pains
                                 that is rarer than genius, and he was one of them.
                                 Whether he made a success or a failure of life, he would
                                 do it with a conscientious use of opportunities, good or
                                 bad.  An eye that is trained to detect the values of
                                 circumstances, and a hand that is quick to adjust them,
                                 have produced the mental forces that make or unmake the
                                 race.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3696">When the day was over he went home and ascended
                                 to his room in silence.  The work had left him with a
                                 curious irritating sense of its distastefulness.  The second
                                 day was as the first—the week was as the month.  There
                                 were no variations, no difficulties, no advancement.  With
                                 the round of monotony his irritation sharpened.  When
                                 Jerry Pollard spoke he responded in monosyllables;
                                 when Jerry Pollard's pretty daughter, Bessie, smiled in
                                 from the doorway, he kept his eyes on the counter.  At
                                 home he was even less responsive.  The impulse which
                                 had prompted him to return a cheering falsehood to his
                                 stepmother passed quickly.  He sacrificed himself to the
                                 family interests, but he sacrificed
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3698"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="143" data-tei-n="148"> </a></span>
                                 himself begrudgingly.  His face assumed lines of
                                 sullen repression; the tones of his voice were full of
                                 subdued resentment.  He found satisfaction in
                                 meeting their overtures with irony, their constraint
                                 with callousness.  Since he had given the one thing
                                 they required and he valued, he justified himself in a
                                 series of petty tyrannies.  He met his stepmother
                                 with avoidance, his father with aversion.  The
                                 children he swore at or ignored.  Amos Burr,
                                 gathering his slow wits together, regarded him with
                                 a chuckle of self-congratulation.  His sensibilities
                                 were not susceptible to slight friction, and his son's
                                 attitude seemed to him of small significance.  He had
                                 got what he wanted, and that was sufficient unto the
                                 hour.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3701">After the first two months, Nicholas underwent a
                                 dogged and indifferent adaptation.  He ceased to
                                 think of the judge, of Juliet, of Eugenia.  He laughed
                                 at Jerry Pollard's jokes and he winked at Jerry
                                 Pollard's daughter.  His horizon narrowed to the four
                                 walls of the shop; he told himself that he had a roof
                                 above his head and fuel for his stomach—that
                                 Bessie Pollard had skin that was fairer than
                                 Eugenia's and lips as red.  What did it matter, after
                                 all?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3704">Sometimes Mrs. Webb entered the store,
                                 sweeping him, as she swept the counter, with her
                                 clear, cold glance, and once Sally Burwell ran in to
                                 do an errand for her mother and nodded with distant
                                 pleasantness as she met his eyes.  At such times he
                                 flushed and ground his teeth, but after Mrs. Webb
                                 came farmer Turner, who shook his hand and said:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3707">“Wall, I'm proud of you, Nick Burr.”</p>

                              <p id="d44710e3713">And after Sally Burwell pretty Bessie Pollard
                                 threw him a kiss from the doorway.  It was not that
                                 he was ashamed of his work.  He knew that at the
                                 close of the war better men than he sought and
                                 accepted gratefully such a livelihood as he
                                 disdained—that women in whose veins ran good
                                 old English blood left their wasted homes to teach in
                                 public schools, or turned their delicate hands to the
                                 needle for support.  He was ashamed of his past
                                 ambition—of his vaunted aspiration—and he was
                                 ashamed of Jerry Pollard and his service.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3716">The winter wore gradually to spring.  A brilliant
                                 April melted into a watery May.  Nicholas, coming
                                 to Kingsborough in the early mornings, would feel
                                 the long spring rains in his face as he splashed
                                 through the puddles in the road.  In the wood the
                                 white blossoms of dogwood showed through
                                 interlacing branches like stars in a network of
                                 closely wrought iron.  On their hardy shrubs the pale
                                 pink clusters of mountain laurel were beaten into
                                 shapeless colour-masses by the wind-blown rains.
                                 Sometimes, up above, where the fiery points of
                                 redbud trees shot skyward, a thrush sang or a blue
                                 jay scolded—and the bird-notes were laden, like the
                                 air, with the primal ripeness of spring.

                              <p id="d44710e3719">Underfoot the earth was fecundating in
                                 dampness.  Chill blue violets emerged from beneath
                                 the spread of rotting leaves, and where the washed-out
                                 sunlight had last shone it had left rays of
                                 wandering dandelions straying from the open
                                 roadside to the edges of the wood.

                              <p id="d44710e3722">And the spring passed into Nicholas also.  The
                                 wonderful renewal of surrounding life thrilled
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3724"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="145" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span>
                                 through the repression of his nature.  With the
                                 flowing of the sap the blood flowed more freely in
                                 his veins.  New possibilities were revealed to him;
                                 new emotions urged him into fresh endeavours.
                                 All his powerful, unspent youth spurred on to manhood.

                              <p id="d44710e3735">At last the rains were over.  The sun came out
                                 again, and with it the growth of the season burst into
                                 abundance.  There were bird-notes on the air,
                                 fragrance in the stillness, bloom on the trees.  In the
                                 thicket dogwood massed itself in clouds of dead
                                 white stars, like an errant trail from the Milky Way,
                                 lighting the wooded twilight.  Wild azalea, so deeply
                                 rose that the hue seemed of the blood, wafted its
                                 sharp, unearthly scent across the underbrush to the
                                 road.  The woods were vocal with the mating songs
                                 of their winged inhabitants.  The music of the thrush
                                 welled from the sheer forceful joy of living.  “It is
                                 good—good—good to be a lover!” he sang again
                                 and again with amorous repetition and a full-throated
                                 flourish of improvisation.  In the pauses of
                                 the thrush sounded the cheery whistle of the redbird,
                                 the crying of the catbird, the liquid tones of the song
                                 sparrow, and the giddy exclamations of the pewee.
                                 Sometimes an oriole darted overhead in a royal flash
                                 of black and yellow, a robin stood in the road and
                                 delivered a hearty invitation, or a hawk flew past,
                                 pursued by martins.

                              <p id="d44710e3738">With the spring planting came a chance of
                                 outdoor work, and Nicholas would sometimes rise at
                                 dawn and do a piece of ploughing before breakfast.
                                 He had driven the team out one morning across the
                                 brown, bare earth, which the plough had ripped
                                 open in a jagged track, when something in the
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3740"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="147" data-tei-n="152"> </a></span>
                                 silence and the scents of nature smote him suddenly
                                 as with a vital force.  Dropping the reins to the
                                 ground, he threw back his head and breathed a
                                 keen, quick sense of exaltation.  A warm mist, sweet
                                 and fresh as the breath of a cow, overhung hill and
                                 field, road and meadow.  In a black-browed cedar
                                 tree a mocking-bird was singing.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3743">With a sudden shout Nicholas voiced the
                                 glorification of toil—of honest work well done.  He
                                 felt with the force of a revelation that to throw up
                                 the clods of earth manfully is as beneficent as to
                                 revolutionise the world.  It was not the matter of the
                                 work, but the mind that went into it, that counted  -
                                 and the man who was not content to do small things
                                 well would leave great things undone.  The beasts
                                 before him did not shirk their labour because it was
                                 clay and not gold dust that trailed behind the plough;
                                 why should he?  And where was happiness if it
                                 sprung not from the soil?  Where contentment if it
                                 dwelt not near to Nature?  For what was better than
                                 these things—the clear air of sunrise, the keen,
                                 sweet smell of the fertile earth, the relaxation of
                                 tired muscles?  Why should he, who had been born
                                 to the soil, struggle forth to alien ends as a sightless
                                 earthworm to the harrow's teeth?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3746">On his way in from the fields he stopped an
                                 instant at the gate of the barnyard to look at the
                                 red-and-white cow that was licking her little,
                                 tottering calf.  Some rollicking lambs were skipping
                                 near a dignified group of ewes, that looked on with
                                 half-fearful, half-disapproving faces.

                                 water bucket, and he took it from her hands.

                                 Nannie, a pretty, auburn-haired girl, was grinding
                                 coffee in a small mill, and he looked at her
                                 thoughtfully; then Jubal came out, whittling a stick,
                                 and he turned his gaze inquiringly upon him.

                                 way.  Don't you come back to raisin' things on this
                                 land.  I ain't never seen nothin' thrive on it yet, cep'n

                              <p id="d44710e3817">“Why, look at Turner,” he said.  “His land is as
                                 poor as this, and he makes an easy living.”

                              <p id="d44710e3820">“A Turner ain't a Burr,” returned his stepmother
                                 with uncompromising logic, “an' a Burr ain't a
                                 Turner.  Whar the blood runs the man follows, an'
                                 yours ain't runnin' towards the farm.  Jeb Turner can
                                 fling a handful of corn in poor groun', an' thar'll
                                 come up a cornfield, an' yo' pa may plant with the

                                 the crows git it.  A farmer's got to be born, same as
                                 a fool.  You can't make a corn pone out of flour
                                 dough by the twistin' of it.”

                              <p id="d44710e3824">“That's so,” admitted Amos Burr, laying down
                                 his knife and meeting his wife's eyes.  “That's so.

                                 laugh; and he rose and went out of the house.

                                 voice behind him, and turned to find his half-sister
                                 Nannie, her cheeks flushed like a damp, wild rose
                                 above her faded dress.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3835">“I want you to bring me something from the
                                 store, Nick,” she stammered.  “I want a blue ribbon
                                 for my hair, it's—it's so worrisome.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3838">She shook her auburn locks, and Nicholas
                                 realised suddenly that she must be very good to look
                                 at—to men who were only in a Scriptural sense her
                                 brothers.  He felt a vague pride in her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3841">“Why, of course I will,” he answered.  “Blue let
                                 it be.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3845">And he opened the gate and went on his way,
                                 leaving Nannie, still flushed, in the path.
                              </p>

                                 half-hour later he stood for an instant looking
                                 thoughtfully down upon the assortment in the
                                 window.  Then he leaned over and conscientiously
                                 set upright a blue-glass vase before going behind the
                                 counter to unpin the curtains hanging across the dry-goods
                                 shelves.

                              <p id="d44710e3851">After breakfast Bessie Pollard came in and stood
                                 with her elbow resting on the showcase as she
                                 flirted a small feather duster.  She had just released
                                 her hair from curl paper, and it hung in golden
                                 ringlets over her forehead.  Her face was ripe and
                                 red, like a well-sunned peach, and the firm curves
                                 of her bosom swelled the gathers of her gown.

                              <p id="d44710e3856">“You look real spry this morning,” she said
                                 coquettishly; but he turned from her in sudden
                                 distaste.  Her tawdry refinement irritated the more
                                 serious manner of his mood.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3859">Presently she went back to her dusting, and he
                                 completed his daily setting to rights of the shop
                                 before he drew up to the desk and made out the
                                 bills that were due for the month.  It was not until
                                 some hours later that he looked up upon hearing a
                                 step on the threshold.  At first he stood up
                                 mechanically at the sight of a girl in a riding-habit.
                                 Then he started and drew back, for the girl lifted
                                 her head, and he saw that it was Eugenia Battle.  In
                                 the same glance he saw also that there was a keen
                                 surprise in her face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3863">“Why, Nick Burr!” she said breathlessly.  She
                                 tripped over her long riding-skirt and caught it hastily
                                 in one hand; in the other she carried a small switch.
                                 She had grown tall and straight, and her hair was
                                 gathered up from her shoulders.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3866">For a moment they were both silent.  In Eugenia's
                                 face the surprise gave place to gladness, and the
                                 warmth of her personality gathered to her eyes.  She
                                 held out her ungloved hand.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3869">“Why, Nick Burr!” she said again.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3872">But Nicholas looked at her in silence.  All the
                                 dogged bitterness of the last six months welled to
                                 his lips—all his new-found philosophy evaporated at
                                 the sting of wounded pride.  He remembered with a
                                 start the gray road on the afternoon in November,
                                 the sullen cast of the sky, the hopeless trend of the
                                 wind among the trees, the leaping of the light into
                                 Eugenia's face.  She laughed now as she had
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e3874"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="152" data-tei-n="157"> </a></span>
                                 laughed then—a hearty little burst of surprise in the
                                 suddenness of the meeting.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3877">He turned quickly from the outstretched hand.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3880">“What can I do for you?” he asked, and his
                                 tone was like Jerry Pollard's.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3884">Eugenia's hand fell to her side, closing upon the
                                 folds of her skirt.  She caught her lip between her
                                 teeth with a petulant twitch.  Then she came
                                 forward and laid a small brown bit of cloth upon the
                                 counter.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3887">“A spool of silk this shade,” she said briskly.
                                 “Please match it very carefully.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3890">Nicholas pulled open the small drawers
                                 containing the silk, and compared the sample with
                                 the row of spools.  He made his selection, showing it
                                 to Eugenia before wrapping it in brown paper.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3893">“Is that all?” he asked grimly.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3896">Eugenia nodded.  He gave her the spool, and she
                                 lifted her skirt and went out of the shop.  A moment
                                 more, and she passed the door swiftly on the brown
                                 mare.  Nicholas closed the drawer and laid the torn
                                 sheet of wrapping paper back in its place.  A little
                                 girl came in for a card of hooks and eyes for her
                                 mother, a dressmaker, and he gave them to her and
                                 dropped the nickel in the till.  When she went out he
                                 followed her to the door and stood looking out into
                                 the gray dust of the street.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3899">Across the way a lady was gathering roses from
                                 a vine that clambered over her piazza, and the
                                 sunlight struck straight at her gracious figure.  From
                                 afar off came the sound of children laughing.  Down
                                 the street several mild-eyed Jersey cows were
                                 driven by a little negro to the court-house green.

                                 In a near tree a wood-bird sang a score of dreamy
                                 notes.  Gradually the quiet of the scene wrought its
                                 spell upon him—the insistent languor drugged him
                                 like a narcotic.  On the wide, restless globe there is
                                 perhaps no village of three streets, no settlement
                                 that has been made by man, so utterly the cradle of
                                 quiescence.  From the listless battlefields, where
                                 grass runs green and wild, to the little white-washed
                                 gaol, where roses bloom, it is a petrified memory, a
                                 perennial day dream.

                              <p id="d44710e3905">The lady across the street passed under her rose
                                 vine, her basket filled with creamy clusters.  The
                                 cows filed lazily on the court-house green.  The
                                 wood-bird in the near tree sang over its dreamy
                                 notes.  The clear black shadows in the street lay like
                                 full-length figures across the vivid sunlight.

                              <p id="d44710e3908">The bitterness passed slowly from his lips.  He
                                 turned, and was reentering the shop, when his name
                                 was called sharply.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e3914">The words were Eugenia's, but the voice was
                                 Tom Bassett's.  He had come up suddenly with the
                                 judge, and as Nicholas turned he caught his hand in
                                 a hearty grasp.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3917">“Well, I call this luck!” he cried.  “I say, Nick,
                                 you haven't grown bald since I saw you.  Do you
                                 remember the time you shaved every strand of hair
                                 off your head so we'd stop calling you 'Carrotty'?”

                                 Nicholas, running his hand through his thick, red
                                 hair.  Then he looked at the judge.  “I hope you are
                                 well, sir,” he added.

                                 courtesy.  “As I trust you are,” he returned
                                 graciously.
                              </p>

                                 father finished, “is that it's a shame—a confounded
                                 shame.  What good will Nick's brains do him in old
                                 Pollard's store?  Old Pollard's a skinflint, anyway,
                                 and he cuffed me once when I was a small chap.”

                                 said.  “Most folks aren't.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3938">“He seems to value Nicholas's services,” added
                                 the judge politely.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3942">Nicholas flushed.  “I don't know about that,” he

                                 wrath, “and that is that I'm not green enough to be
                                 fooled by Nick Burr, if other people are.  Father told
                                 me last night that it was Nick's own choice that
                                 took him to Jerry Pollard's.  Choice, the Dickens!
                                 Why, it's those blasted people of his that put him
                                 here.”

                                 They looked at the judge, and the judge looked back
                                 at them with a humorous twinkle in his eyes.

                              <p id="d44710e3951">“My dear Tom,” he said at last, “I never gave
                                 you credit for being a Solomon, but some day your
                                 wit may put your father to shame.”

                                 remarked, “you may learn that, though an old fool
                                 may be the biggest fool, he's not the only one.
                                 Come to see us when you feel like it, eh, Tom?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e3961">They passed on together, and Nicholas stood

                                 looking after them until a man came in to exchange
                                 a pair of shoes.

                              <p id="d44710e3966">“They're a leetle too skimpy 'cross the toes,” he
                                 said deprecatingly.  “The heels air first-rate, but the
                                 toes sorter seem to be made fur a three-toed
                                 somebody.  'Tain't as if I could jest set aroun' in 'em,
                                 of course; then they'd be a fine fit, but when I go ter

                                 back upon the shelf.  He was thinking of Tom
                                 Bassett and the twinkle in the judge's eyes, and he
                                 did not hear the man's rambling speech.  It seemed
                                 to him that his friendship with Tom and his father
                                 had been restored—that he might once more go
                                 freely in and out of the judge's house.

                                 homeward along the deserted road, his mind still
                                 busy with recollections of the morning.  Yes, life
                                 was decidedly endurable at worst.  If he might not
                                 become celebrated, he might at least become
                                 content.  He was not Tom Bassett, but he had Tom
                                 Bassett's friendship.  He would live a simple life in
                                 his own class among his own people, and he would
                                 grow to be respected by those who were above
                                 him.

                                 steps through the thickening twilight.

                                 fought and won.  He went back to his books—went
                                 back because his intellect ordained it, and the
                                 ordinance of intellect is fate—but bitterness had
                                 gone out of him, and he had come into his own.
                                 From the stress of the last year he had found
                                 security in acceptance.  His life might not be such as
                                 he had planned it—whose was?—his work might
                                 not be the thing he wanted—again, whose
                                 was?—but life and work were with him, and it
                                 remained for him to make the best of them.  Fate
                                 might make him a shopkeeper; he would see to it
                                 that it made him a successful one.  Success read
                                 backwards spelt work, and work was his
                                 inheritance—a heritage of sweat and labour.

                              <p id="d44710e3989">He went to Jerry Pollard's an hour earlier that he
                                 might rearrange to advantage the shelves.  His
                                 employer had secured, below cost, a supply of dry
                                 goods, and preparations were in the making for the
                                 first summer sale in Kingsborough.  Nicholas
                                 conducted the arrangements as conscientiously as
                                 he might have conducted a legal argument.  It was
                                 the thing before him, and it must not fail.

                                 supper was over and he had helped his father with

                                 memory nothing passed.  He held his knowledge
                                 with the same vital grip with which he held his
                                 friends.

                                 volumes girdling the walls, and absorbed the judge
                                 as the judge, in his own time, had absorbed the men

                                 principles and simple deeds Nicholas's future was
                                 drawing nourishment.  Judge Bassett had lived his
                                 life in a village, but he had lived it among statesmen.
                                 His book-shelves were green with their inspiration,
                                 his memory fresh from their impress.  In his youth
                                 he himself had been one of the hopes of his State; in
                                 his age he was one of her consolations.

                              <p id="d44710e4001">He treated the younger man with that quaint
                                 courtliness which knew not affectation.  When he
                                 talked to him, as he often did, of the great legal
                                 minds, it was always with the courtesy of their titles.
                                 He spoke of “Mr. Chancellor Kent,” of “Mr.
                                 Justice Blackstone,” as he spoke of “President
                                 Davis” or of “General Lee.”  To have alluded to
                                 them more familiarly he would have held to be a
                                 breach of etiquette of unpardonable grossness.

                                 night.  He had his periods of depression, when desire
                                 seemed greater than duty, as he had his periods of
                                 exaltation, when duty seemed greater than desire.

                                 hated as thoroughly as he did the work he loved.

                                 chilled into autumn.  He had kept rigidly to his way
                                 and to his resolutions.  From neither had he swerved
                                 in one regard.  His stepmother, fixing sharp, tired
                                 eyes upon him mentally drafted, “Arter all's said an'

                                 content, as she had reason to, for he gave no

                                 the early dinner, a generous mint julep upon a silver
                                 tray on his desk.  Caesar was an acknowledged
                                 artist in the mixing of the beverage, and Mrs.

                                 more men in the State to-day who can make a
                                 speech than can mix a julep.  Caesar's distinction is
                                 greater than mine.”

                                 odorous, the judge raised his own goblet and bowed
                                 to his caller.

                                 hopes.

                              <p id="d44710e4233">“Y-e-s,” answered the general lamely, and he
                                 returned to the Richmond papers with an eager
                                 flush in his face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4236">The next day when Eugenia reached
                                 Kingsborough she found the dilapidated carriage
                                 awaiting her, with Sampson upon the driver's seat.
                                 With an impetuous flutter she threw her arms about
                                 the necks of the old horses.  “Why, you dear things!”
                                 she cried; then she held out her hand to Sampson.
                                 “I'm glad to see you, Sampson,” she said.  “But why
                                 didn't papa come to meet me?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4239">Her animated eyes glanced joyously from side to
                                 side and her lips were brimming with the delight of
                                 homecoming.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4242">Sampson turned the wheel for her as she got into
                                 the carriage, and gave her the linen lap-robe.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4246">“You sho is growed, Miss Eugeny,” he observed,
                                 and then in reply to her question, “Marse Tom hev
                                 got pow'ful stiff-jinted recentelly.  Hit seems like

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4249">The carriage jolted through Kingsborough, and
                                 Eugenia bowed smilingly to her acquaintances.
                                 Once she stopped to shake hands with the rector
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e4251"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="166" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span>
                                 and again to kiss Sally Burwell, who flew into her
                                 arms.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4254">“Why, Eugie!  you—you beauty!” she cried.
                                 Eugenia laughed delightedly, her black eyes
                                 glowing.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4257">“Am I good-looking?” she asked.  “I'm so glad.
                                 But I'll never be as pretty as you, you dear, sweet
                                 thing.  I'm too big.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4260">They laughed and kissed again, and Eugenia
                                 stepped from the carriage to greet the judge, who
                                 was passing.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4263">“This is a sight for sore eyes, my dear,” said the
                                 judge, his fine old face wreathed in smiles.  Then, as
                                 his gaze ran over her full, straight figure, “they
                                 make fine women these days,” he added.  “You're
                                 as tall as your father—though you're your mother's
                                 child.  Yes, I can see Amelia Tucker in your eyes.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4267">“Thank you—thank you,” said the girl in a throaty
                                 voice.  There was a glow, a warmth, a fervour in
                                 her face which harmonized the chill black and white
                                 of her colouring.  Her expression was as a lamp to
                                 illumine the mask of her features.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4270">“I couldn't stay away,” she went on breathlessly.
                                 “I love Kingsborough better than the whole world.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4273">“And Kingsborough loves you,” returned the
                                 judge.  “Yes, it is a good old town and well worth
                                 dying in, after all.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4276">He assisted Eugenia into the carriage, shook
                                 hands again, and the lumbering old vehicle jogged
                                 on its way.  In a moment another halt was called,
                                 and Mrs. Webb came from her gate to give the girl
                                 welcome.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4279">“This is a surprise,” she said as she kissed
                                 her.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e4285">“I dined at Battle Hall last week, and they didn't tell
                                 me you were coming.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4288">“They didn't know it,” laughed Eugenia.  “I come
                                 like a bolt from the blue.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4291">Mrs. Webb smiled coldly.  She was just as the girl
                                 had known her in childhood—only the high black
                                 pompadour was now white.  She still wore her stiff
                                 black silk gown, fastened at the throat by a
                                 Confederate button set in a brooch.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4294">“You are like yourself and no one else,” said
                                 Eugenia simply.  “But tell me of Dudley—where is
                                 he?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4297">Mrs. Webb's face softened slightly.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4300">“His practice is in Richmond now,” she
                                 answered.  “You know he studied law and took
                                 great honours at college.  But his ambitions, I fear,
                                 are political.  I don't like politics.  They aren't for
                                 honest men.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4304">Eugenia did not smile.  She merely nodded assent
                                 and, saying good-bye pleasantly, jolted out of
                                 Kingsborough into the Old Stage Road.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4307">“When did Mrs. Webb dine at home, Sampson?”
                                 she asked suddenly after a long silence.
                              </p>

                                 thoughtfully.  “Mo' like hit wuz tree times.  She done

                              <p id="d44710e4313">But Eugenia was seeking other information.  “Is

                                 and did you bury Jim in the graveyard?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4318">“Dey's all well,” replied Sampson, flicking at a
                                 horsefly on the sorrel's back, “an' Jim, he's well en

                              <p id="d44710e4321">A little later they turned into the cedar avenue,
                                 and Eugenia could see the large white pillars of the
                                 porch.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4325">“There they are!” she cried excitedly, and
                                 before the carriage stopped she was up the narrow
                                 walk and in the general's arms.

                              <p id="d44710e4328">“Well, daughter!  daughter!” said the general.  His
                                 eyes were watery, and when Eugenia fell upon
                                 Miss Chris, he blew his nose loudly with a nervous
                                 wave of his silk handkerchief.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4331">“I was obliged to come,” explained Eugenia.
                                 “When I got your letter saying I might, I was so

                              <p id="d44710e4334">“Tom!” murmured Miss Chris reproachfully, but
                                 her eyes were shining and she laid an affectionate
                                 hand on her brother's arm.

                              <p id="d44710e4352">Aunt Verbeny fixed her eyes upon the general
                                 and he quailed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4355">“Don't I take care of you, Aunt Verbeny?” he
                                 asked appealingly; but Eugenia, having greeted the
                                 remaining servants, drew him with her into the
                                 dining-room. When he sat down at last to the
                                 heavily laden table, he seemed to have grown
                                 twenty years younger. As Eugenia hung over him
                                 with domineering devotion, the irritable expression
                                 faded from his face and he grew almost jovial.
                                 When she weakened his coffee, he protested
                                 delightedly, and when she refused to allow him his
                                 nightly dole of preserved quinces, he stormed with
                                 rapture. “She wants to starve me, the tyrant,” he
                                 declared. “She'll take the very bread from my
                                 mouth next.”

                                 though why she was surprised or what she was
                                 surprised at the general never knew.

                                 out her candle and undressed by the full light of the
                                 moon as it shone through the giant sycamore.
                                 Outside, the lawn lay like a sheet unrolled, rent by
                                 sharp black shadows. All the dear, familiar objects
                                 were draped by the darkness as by a curtain; the
                                 body of the sycamore assumed a spectral pallor,
                                 and the

                                 From the dusk beneath the window the fragrance of
                                 the mimosa tree floated into the room.

                                 her bed and slept.

                                 “I'm coming back to take you for exercise,” she
                                 remarked to the general as she stood before him in
                                 her sunbonnet.

                              <p id="d44710e4382">The general, who was placidly smoking, groaned
                                 in protest.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4386">“Then you'll kill me, Eugie,” he urged. “Exercise
                                 doesn't suit me. I'm too heavy.”
                              </p>

                                 reassuringly. “You don't move about half enough,
                                 but I'll make you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4392">The general groaned again, and Miss Chris, pink
                                 and fresh in her linen sacque, came out upon the
                                 porch.

                              <p id="d44710e4395">“Bless the child!” she exclaimed. “Where on
                                 earth did she lay hands on that bonnet? Don't stay
                                 out too long in the sun, Eugie, or you'll burn black.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4398">The general caught at the straw.</p>

                                 dark head and disappeared across the lawn.

                                 her sunbonnet.“ Aunt Verbeny told me the baby
                                 died. I am so sorry.”

                                 her as a benignant providence. Her sweetness of
                                 disposition became a proverb. “As sunshiny ez

                                 and the general raised her wages.

                              <p id="d44710e4453">During the early summer Bernard came home on
                                 a vacation. For several years he had held a position
                                 in a bank in Lynchburg, and his visits to
                                 Kingsborough took place at uncertain intervals. He
                                 was a slight, insignificant young fellow, with
                                 complacent eyes and a beautiful, girlish mouth. His
                                 temper was quicker than Eugenia's, and he was in
                                 continual friction with the general, who had grown
                                 absentminded and irritable. He not only forgot his
                                 own opinions as soon as he expressed them, but,
                                 what is still more annoying, he was apt to offer
                                 them as some one's else in the course of a few
                                 hours.

                                 Bernard indifferently. “He isn't a gentleman, but I
                                 shouldn't call him a scamp.”

                                 demanded the general. “It's no business of yours, is

                                 round, inquiring eyes. “Now, father, you don't mean
                                 one word that you're saying, and you know it.” And
                                 she proceeded to butter his cakes.

                                 he got into the carriage beside his daughter and
                                 drove slowly into town. When he returned to dinner
                                 he met Miss Chris with triumphant eyes.

                                 person. I don't see how you got it into your head
                                 there was something wrong about him.”

                                 good-humouredly. She had never uttered a harsh
                                 word about anybody in her life, but she was a 
                                 long-suffering woman, and she philosophically accepted
                                 the accusation.

                                 “You won't go in to town, I suppose?”

                              <p id="d44710e4501">The general flushed and put out a preliminary
                                 feeler. “How are you going?” he inquired; “not on
                                 one of my horses, I hope?”

                                 on recklessly:

                              <p id="d44710e4511">The general shook his head until his flabby face
                                 grew purple.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4514">“The gray mare!” he thundered. “You mean to
                                 take out my gray mare, do you ? Well, I'd like to
                                 see you, sir. Not a step does the gray mare stir
                                 —not a step, sir.”

                              <p id="d44710e4517">“Oh, all right,” agreed Bernard so quietly that the
                                 general's rage increased. “Keep her in the stables,
                                 for all I care.” And, having finished his breakfast,
                                 he bowed to Miss Chris and left the table.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4520">But an hour later, as he passed through the hall,
                                 he found the general waiting. “Aren't you ready?”
                                 he asked irascibly. “Are you going to waste the

                                 there was no reason it should be better; but he
                                 couldn't stand his father, and he knew it.

                              <p id="d44710e4532">“Not going!” cried the general hotly, “not going
                                 after all the fuss you've raised? What do you mean
                                 by changing your mind every minute?”

                                 “and I don't choose to walk—that's what I mean.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4538">But his answer only exasperated his hovering

                              <p id="d44710e4542">“Damme, sir, do you want to make me lose my
                                 temper?” he demanded. “Isn't the stable full of
                                 horses? Where's the gray mare, I'd like to know, sir?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4545">“Eugie!” called Bernard angrily, “come here.”
                                 And as the girl appeared he made a break from the
                                 house. He possessed an abiding faith in the
                                 endurance of Eugenia's clannish soul that was proof
                                 against even the suggestion that it might succumb.
                                 His father was unquestionably trying, but Eugie was
                                 unquestionably strong, and she loved her people
                                 with a passion which he felt to be romantically
                                 unsurpassable. Yes, Eugie was the hope of the
                                 family, after all.
                              </p>

                                 this she saw and suffered at seeing. There were
                                 wrinkles crossing and recrossing his hanging
                                 cheeks, and swollen bluish pockets beneath his
                                 eyes. When he moved he carried his great weight
                                 uneasily. During the day she hung over him with
                                 multiplied caresses; as he sat upon the porch in the

                                 Shakespeare, the only books his library contained.

                              <p id="d44710e4556">Now he asked the question of Eugenia, and she
                                 smiled and was silent. Her eyes passed from the
                                 porch to the lawn and the walk and the immemorial
                                 gloom of the great cedars. Sunshine lay over all the
                                 warm, sleepy land, and sunshine lay across her
                                 white dress and across the senile droop of the
                                 general's mouth.

                                 along the branch road that led to his father's farm. He
                                 carried a well filled bag upon his shoulder, the musty
                                 surface of which betrayed that it contained freshly
                                 ground meal, but, despite the additional weight, his figure
                                 was unflinchingly erect. There was a splendid vigour in
                                 his thick-set frame and in the swinging strides of his
                                 hardy limbs. His face—the square-jawed, large-featured
                                 face of a philosopher or a farmer—possessed, with its
                                 uncompromising ugliness, a certain eccentric power.
                                 Rugged, gray, alert-eyed as it was, large-browed and
                                 over-hung by his waving red hair—it was a face to attract
                                 or to repel—not to be ignored.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4593">Now, as he swung on vigorously in the October light,
                                 there was about him a joyousness of purpose which
                                 belonged to his age and his aspirations. It was an
                                 atmosphere, an emanation thrown off by respiring
                                 vitality.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4596">Across the road the sunshine fell in long, level shafts.
                                 The spirit of October was abroad in the wood—veiling
                                 itself in a faint, bluish haze like the smoke of the
                                 greenwood when it burns. Overhead,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e4598"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="178" data-tei-n="186"> </a></span>
                                 crimson and yellow ran riot among the trees, the
                                 flame of the maple extinguishing the dull red of the
                                 oak, the clear gold of the hickory flashing through
                                 the gloss of the holly. As yet the leaves had not
                                 begun to fall; they held tenaciously to the living
                                 branches, fluttering light heads in the first autumn
                                 chill. In the underbrush, where the deerberry
                                 showed hectic blotches, a squirrel worked busily,
                                 completing its winter store, while in the slanting sun
                                 rays a tawny butterfly, like a wind-blown, loosened
                                 tiger lily, danced its last mad dance with death.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4601">To Nicholas the scene was without significance.
                                 With a gesture he threw off the spell of its beauty,
                                 as he shifted the “sack” of corn meal upon his
                                 shoulder. He had found Uncle Ish tottering
                                 homeward with the load, and he had taken it from
                                 him with a careless promise to leave it at the old
                                 negro's cabin door—then, passing him by a stride,
                                 he had gone on his kindly, confident way. He forgot
                                 Uncle Ish as readily as he forgot the bag he carried.
                                 His mind was busily reviewing the points of his last
                                 case and the possible facts of a more important one
                                 he believed to be coming to him. In this connection
                                 he went back to his first fight in the little courthouse,
                                 and he laughed with an appreciation of the humour
                                 of his success. It was Turner, after all, who had
                                 given it to him; Turner, who, having bought a horse
                                 that died upon the journey home, wanted revenge as
                                 well as recompense. He remembered his
                                 perturbation as he rose to cross-examine the
                                 defendant—the nervousness with which he
                                 drove his weapons home. It had all seemed so
                                 important to
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e4603"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="187"> </a></span>
                                 him then—the court, his client, the great, greasy
                                 horse dealer forced into the witness stand.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4607">He had proved his case by the defendant, and he
                                 had won as well a mild reputation among the
                                 farmers who had assembled for the day. Since then
                                 he had done well, and the judge's patronage had
                                 placed much in his hands that, otherwise, would
                                 have gone elsewhere.

                              <p id="d44710e4610">Beyond the wood, the uncultivated wasteland
                                 sported its annual carnival of golden rod and
                                 sumach, and across the brilliant plumes a round, red
                                 sun hung suspended in a quiet sky. In the corn field,
                                 where the late crop was fast maturing, negro
                                 women chanted shrilly as they pulled the “fodder,”
                                 their high-coloured kerchiefs blending, like autumn
                                 foliage, with the landscape. Around them the
                                 denuded stalks rose boldly row on row, reserving
                                 their scarred and yellow husks for the last harvest
                                 of the year.

                              <p id="d44710e4613">When Nicholas reached his father's house he did
                                 not enter the little whitewashed gate, but kept on to
                                 the log cabin on the edge of General Battle's land,
                                 where Uncle Ish was passing his declining years in
                                 poverty and independence. The cabin stood above a
                                 little gully which skirted the dividing line of the
                                 pastures, facing, in its primitive nudity, the level
                                 stretch of the shadowless highway. It was a rotting,
                                 one-room dwelling, with a wide doorway opening
                                 upon a small, bare strip of ground where a gnarled
                                 oak grew. In the rear there was a small garden,
                                 denuded now of its modest vegetables, only the
                                 leafy foliage of a late pea crop retaining a
                                 semblance of fruitfulness.
                              </p>
                              <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e4616"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="180" data-tei-n="188"> </a></span>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4618">Nicholas went up the narrow path leading from
                                 the road to the hut, and placed the bag on the
                                 smooth, round stone which served for a step. As he
                                 did so, the doorway abruptly darkened, and a girl
                                 came from the interior and paused with her foot
                                 upon the threshold. He saw, in an upward glance,
                                 that it was Eugenia Battle, and, from the light wicker
                                 basket on her arm, he inferred that, in the absence
                                 of Uncle Ish, she had been engaged in supplying his
                                 simple wants. That the old negro was still cared for
                                 by the Battles he was aware, though upon the
                                 means of his livelihood Uncle Ish, himself, was
                                 singularly reticent.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4621">As Eugenia saw him she flushed slightly, as one
                                 caught in a secret charity, and promptly pointed to
                                 the bag of meal.

                              <p id="d44710e4628">He looked from the girl to the bag and back
                                 again, his own cheek reddening. At the-instant it
                                 occurred to him that it was a peculiar greeting after
                                 a separation of years.

                                 unreasonable embarrassment. “I believe your
                                 father gave it to him.”

                              <p id="d44710e4647">“What were you doing with it?”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4650">Her gaze was warming upon him. He met it and
                                 laughed aloud.

                              <p id="d44710e4658">She was still warming. He saw the glow kindle in
                                 her eyes and illumine her sombre face; it was like
                                 the leaping of light to the surface. As she stood
                                 midway of the entrance, in a frame of unpolished
                                 logs, her white and black beauty against the smoky
                                 gloom of the interior, the red sunset before her feet,
                                 he recalled swiftly an allegorical figure of Night he
                                 had once seen in an old engraving. Then, before the
                                 charm of her smile, the recollection passed as it had
                                 come.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4662">“You may bring in the bag,” she said, with the
                                 authority of one accustomed to much service. “I
                                 found he had very little left to eat. We have to bring
                                 him things secretly, and he pretends the Lord feeds
                                 him as He fed the prophet.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4665">She reentered the hut, and Nicholas, stepping
                                 lightly in the fear that his weight might hasten the
                                 fall of the logs, deposited the bag upon a pine table,
                                 where an ash cake lay ready for the embers. In a
                                 little cupboard he saw the contents of Eugenia's
                                 basket—a cold fried chicken and some coffee and
                                 sugar. Before the hearth there was a comfortable
                                 rocking chair, and a bright coloured quilt was upon
                                 the bed. As he turned away the girl spoke swiftly:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4668">“It was good of you,” she said.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4671">“Good of me?” He met her approbation almost
                                 haughtily; then he impulsively added: “I always
                                 liked Uncle Ish—and he reminds me of old times.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4674">She turned frankly to him. In the noble poise of
                                 her head she had seemed strangely far off; now
                                 she appeared to stoop.

                              <p id="d44710e4681">Her cordial eyes arrested him.</p>

                                 and he found you out—do you remember?”

                                 steps to his father's house.

                                 Turners of Nicholas's boyhood.  By the light of the

                                 fresh, her auburn curls hanging heavily against her

                                 hand.

                                 placed the butter upon the table.  Then she went across
                                 to Nannie and examined the hem on the cambric ruffle.

                                 office, where he met Dudley Webb, who was
                                 spending a dutiful week in Kingsborough.  He was a
                                 genial young fellow, with a clear-cut, cleanly shaven
                                 face and a handsome head covered with rich, dark
                                 hair.  His hands were smooth and white, and he
                                 gesticulated rapidly as he talked.  It was already said
                                 of him that he told a poor story better than anybody
                                 else told a good one—a fact which was probably
                                 the elemental feature of his popularity.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4954">As Nicholas looked in, he raised himself lightly
                                 from Tom's desk chair and gave him a hearty
                                 handshake.
                              </p>

                                 telling Tom a jolly thing I heard yesterday.  Two
                                 farmers were discussing you at the post-office, and
                                 one of them said: ''Tain't that he's got so much
                                 sense—I had a sight more at his age—but he's so
                                 blamed sure of himself, he makes you believe in
                                 him.'  How's that for fame?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4960">“Not so bad as it is for me,” returned Nicholas
                                 with a laugh.  “If you win one or two small cases,
                                 there's obliged to be undue influence of the devil.”
                              </p>

                                 crossed his shapely legs.  For a moment he smoked
                                 in silence, then he removed his cigar from his
                                 mouth and flecked the ashes upon the uncarpeted
                                 floor.

                                 exist down here and live to tell the tale—or at least
                                 that you earn enough crumbs to feed the crows.”

                                 remarked Nicholas as he threw himself into the
                                 remaining chair.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4978">Dudley laughed softly—a humorous laugh that
                                 fell pleasantly on the ear.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4982">“That reminds me,” he began whimsically.  “I
                                 met a tourist with spectacles walking along Duke of
                                 Gloucester Street.  'Sir,' he said courteously, 'I am
                                 looking for Kingsborough.  I am told that it is a city.'
                                 'Sir,' I responded, with a bow that did honour to my
                                 grandfather's ghost, 'it was once a chartered city; it
                                 is now only a charter.' ”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4985">Then he turned to Tom.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4988">“We haven't got used to the railroad yet, have
                                 we?” he asked.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4991">Tom shook his head.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4994">“General Battle's still protesting,” he replied.
                                 “He swears it makes Kingsborough common.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e4997">Dudley thoughtfully examined his cigar, an
                                 amused smile about his mouth.
                              </p>

                                 the churchyard,” he observed, “because it would
                                 abolish one of Kingsborough's characteristics.  She's
                                 right, too, by Jove.”

                              <p id="d44710e5004">“They're having a fight over it now,” put in
                                 Nicholas with the gravity he rarely lost.  “The
                                 people who own cows call it an 'ancient right.'  The
                                 people who don't, call it sacrilege.  The rector leads
                                 one faction, and the congregation has split.”
                              </p>

                                 these are exciting times in Kingsborough's history;
                                 it is almost as lively as Richmond.  There we had a
                                 religious convention and an elopement last week.  I
                                 don't suppose you come up to that?”

                              <p id="d44710e5012">Nicholas ran his hand through his hair with a
                                 habitual gesture.  He was idly watching the light of
                                 Dudley's cigar and noting the quality by the aroma.
                                 He could not afford cigars himself, and he
                                 wondered how Dudley managed to do so.

                                 open window, lit a cigarette, and changed the
                                 subject.  He talked easily, relating several laughable
                                 stories, referring occasionally to himself and his
                                 success, illustrating his remarks by his experience at
                                 the bar, giving finally the exclamation of a
                                 fellow-lawyer at the close of an argument he had
                                 made: “You may be a muff of a jurist, Webb,” he
                                 had cried, “but, by George!  you're a devil of an
                                 advocate!”

                              <p id="d44710e5068">He was, withal, so affable, so confident, so
                                 thoroughly a good fellow, that an hour passed
                                 before Nicholas remembered he had looked in only
                                 for a moment.

                              <p id="d44710e5071">When he rose to go, Dudley gripped his hand
                                 again, slapped him on the shoulder, declared him to
                                 be a “first-rate old chap,” and ended by pressing
                                 him to drop in on him when he ran up to Richmond.

                                 pledged himself to the “dropping in.”  He resistingly
                                 succumbed before the inherent jovial charm.

                              <p id="d44710e5078">The afternoon being Saturday, he left town
                                 earlier than usual and spent a couple of hours with
                                 his father in the fields.  The peanuts were being
                                 harvested.  Amos Burr, with a peanut “share”
                                 attached to the plough, was separating the yellowed
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e5080"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="192" data-tei-n="200"> </a></span>
                                 plants from the ripe nuts underground, and Nicholas,
                                 lifting the roots upon a pitchfork, shook them free
                                 from earth and threw them over the pointed staves
                                 which were the final supports of the “hocks.”  A
                                 negro hand went before him, driving the sticks into
                                 the sandy soil.

                                 acre,” remarked Nicholas cheerfully, as he lifted a
                                 detached root from a broken hill.  “It's a fair yield,
                                 isn't it?”

                              <p id="d44710e5086">Amos Burr shook his head and muttered that
                                 there was “no tellin'.  Peanuts air one of the things
                                 thar's no countin' on,” he added.  “Wheat air
                                 another, corn air another, oats air another.”

                              <p id="d44710e5089">“Life is another,” concluded Nicholas lightly.
                                 “Still we live and still we raise wheat and oats and
                                 corn.  But I wish you'd look into market gardening.  I
                                 believe it would pay you better.”

                              <p id="d44710e5092">“ 'Tain't no use,” returned Amos, with his
                                 accustomed pessimism.  “ 'Tain't no use my plantin'
                                 as long as the government ain't goin' to move,
                                 nohow.  It's been promisin' to help the farmer ever

                              <p id="d44710e5095">But Nicholas, to avoid his father's political drift,
                                 fell to talking with one of the negro workers.

                                 walked with her to Battle Hall, where the general
                                 received him with ready, if condescending,
                                 hospitality.  Eugenia had instructed her family upon
                                 the changed conditions of Nicholas's social standing,
                                 but her logic was powerless to convince her father

                                 a lawyer—only gentlemen belong to the bar, but
                                 there's nobody too high or too low to be a farmer.
                                 Polite to him?  Did you ever see me impolite in my

                                 her cheek and accused her of “making fun of her
                                 old father.”

                                 with him as he conversed with the chicken sellers
                                 who came of an afternoon to receive payment for

                                 addressed his inferiors.  “You'll be cutting your corn
                                 before long and seeding your winter crops.  What
                                 are you planting this fall?”

                                 said he certainly thought the seasons had changed

                                 heads, and bordering the narrow walk were lines of
                                 chrysanthemums and dahlias: October roses, the
                                 richest of the year, bloomed and dropped in the
                                 quaint old squares where the long vegetable rows
                                 began.  At the end of the straight, overgrown walk
                                 the hop vines on the fence threw out a pungent
                                 odour.

                                 white dress.  Over all was the faint violet haze of
                                 the season, hanging above the gay old garden like a
                                 delicate effluvium from autumns long decayed.

                                 upon her cheek, as warm as the late sunshine.

                                 her so gratefully, but the evidence that Nicholas
                                 was good enough to consider her so.

                                 sunshine.  Eugenia, rising at daybreak for a gallop
                                 across country, would feel the dew in her face and
                                 the autumn in her blood.  As she dashed over fences
                                 and ditches to the unploughed pasture, the morning
                                 was as desolate as midnight—not a soul showed in
                                 the surrounding fields and the long road lay as pallid
                                 as a streak of frost.  The loneliness and the hour set
                                 her eyes to dancing and the glad blood to bounding
                                 in her veins.  When a startled rabbit shied from the
                                 brushwood she would slacken her speed to watch it,
                                 and when, as sometimes chanced, she frightened a
                                 covey of partridges from their retreat, she went
                                 softly, rejoicing that no shot was near.

                              <p id="d44710e5361">At this time she was possessed, perhaps, of a
                                 spirit too elastic, of a buoyance almost insolent—she
                                 turned, as it were, too round a cheek to Fate.  In her
                                 clear purity romanticism held no part, and her soul,
                                 strong to adhere, was slow to conform.  Her nature
                                 was straight as an arrow that would not fall though
                                 it overshot the mark.  She dreamed scant dreams of
                                 the future because she clove tenaciously to the
                                 past—to the rare associations and the old
                                 affections—to the road and the cedars and the Hall
                                 as to the men and women whose blood she bore
                                 and whose likeness she carried.  She loved one and
                                 all with a fidelity that did not swerve.  Riding home
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e5363"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="210"> </a></span>
                                 along the open road that led to the cedars, she
                                 marked each friendly object in its turn—on one side
                                 the persimmon tree where the fruit ripened—on the
                                 other the blackened wreck of the giant oak,
                                 towering above the shining spread of life-everlasting.
                                 She noted that the rail fence skirting the
                                 pasture sagged at one corner beneath a weight of
                                 poisonous oak, that a mud hole had eaten through
                                 the short strip of “corduroy” road, and that where
                                 Uncle Ish's path led to his cabin the plank across the
                                 gully was rapidly rotting.  She saw these things with
                                 the tender eyes with which we mark decay in one
                                 beloved.

                                 she would call “good-morning” to the general and
                                 leap lightly to the ground, fresh as the day, bright as
                                 the autumn.

                                 Nicholas again.  She was returning leisurely through
                                 the stretch of woodland, when, catching sight of him
                                 as he swung vigorously ahead, she quickened her

                                 inquiringly back.

                                 retorted lightly.  “Have you been far?”

                                 maple boughs, which surrounded her like a flame.
                                 The mist of the morning was on her lips and her
                                 eyes were shining.  He felt her beauty leap like wine to

                                 complained, “or honeyshucks, at least—now there's

                                 hardened by the plough.  It was a powerful hand,
                                 brown and sinewy, with distorted knuckles and
                                 broken nails.  “Oh, not that,” he said.  “I don't mean
                                 that.  That shows work, but I know you—Genia—
                                 you will tell me work is manly.  So it is, but is

                                 stopped to hold them aside for her.  His eyes followed

                                 thought, in his folly, of the lady in the old romance
                                 who was, to the desire of her lovers, as “a distant

                                 as several loosened leaves fluttered to the road.
                                 “So I am not terrible, after all.”  The glow of the
                                 gum-tree was in her face.  His eyes fell before it, and he
                                 did not speak.  The soft footfalls of the horse on the
                                 damp ground sounded distinctly.  Overhead the wind
                                 rustled among the trees.

                                 the pleasant condescension of the general in her
                                 manner.  “Fine weather, isn't it?”

                                 muttered reservation, that the weather might be
                                 worse.  Then he looked at Nicholas.  “If you ain't got
                                 nothin' better to do I reckon you might lend a hand
                                 at the ploughin',” he surlily suggested.

                                 vaulted the whitewashed fence, while Eugenia,
                                 touching her horse into a gallop, vanished in the
                                 distance of the open road, blazing her track with
                                 scarlet gum leaves that scattered royally in the
                                 wind.

                                 pleasantly to the congregation of negroes assembled
                                 for the annual festival called “a picking.”  They
                                 ranged in degrees from Uncle Ish, the oldest
                                 representative of his race, to Betsey's five-year-old
                                 Jeremiah, who had already been detected in an
                                 attempt to filch the nuts from an overturned shock,
                                 and was being soundly admonished by his mother's
                                 avenging palm.  The ground was strewn with baskets
                                 and buckets of varying dimensions, into which the
                                 nuts were gathered before being consigned to the
                                 huge hamper guarded by Amos Burr.  A hoarse
                                 clamour, like that produced by a flock of crows,
                                 went up from the animated swarm as it settled to
                                 work.

                              <p id="d44710e5567">Nicholas crossed to the adjoining field and
                                 ploughed deep furrows in the soil, going into
                                 breakfast with the smell of the warm earth about him and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e5569"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="208" data-tei-n="216"> </a></span>

                                 and listened without remark to the political vagaries
                                 of his father.  Amos Burr had been “looking into
                                 politics” of late, and his stubborn wits had been
                                 fixed by a grievance.  “If he was a fool befo' now
                                 he's a plum fool now,” Marthy Burr had observed
                                 dispassionately.  “I ain't never seen no head so level
                                 that it could bear the lettin' in of politics.  It makes a
                                 fool of a man and a worse fool of a fool.  The
                                 government's like a mule, it's slow and it's sure; it's
                                 slow to turn, and it's sure to turn the way you don't
                                 want it.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5572">“I tell you it's done promised to help the farmer,”
                                 put in Amos heavily, bringing his large red hand
                                 down upon the table.  “Ain't it been helpin' the
                                 manufacturer all these years?  Ain't it been lookin'
                                 arter the labourer, black an' white?  Ain't it time for
                                 it to keep its word to the farmer?”

                                 ploughing, if I were you,” suggested Nicholas.  “The
                                 more work in the fall the less in the spring—that's a
                                 proverb for you.”

                                 sullenly. “I want my rights, an' I want the country
                                 to give 'em to me.”
                              </p>

                                 an' wishin' for rights,” remarked his wife tartly.  “It's
                                 a sight better to be up an' plantin'.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5584">Nicholas finished his breakfast, and a little later
                                 walked in to town.  He was in exuberant spirits and
                                 his thoughts were high on the scaffolding where his
                                 future was building.  Success and Eugenia startled,
                                 allured, delighted him.  He was at the age
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e5586"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="209" data-tei-n="217"> </a></span>
                                 of sublime self-confidence, but his eyes were not
                                 bandaged by it.  He knew that without success—
                                 such success as he dreamed of—there could be, for
                                 him, no Eugenia.  He believed in her as he believed in
                                 the sun, and yet he was not sure of her—he could
                                 not be until he possessed her and she bore his name.
                                 That she might not love him he admitted; that she
                                 might even love another he saw to be dimly possible;
                                 but he was determined that so long as no other man
                                 held her his arms should be open.  In the first ardour
                                 of his mood his relative position to that society of
                                 which she formed a part was lost sight of, if not
                                 obscured.  Now he realised bitterly that he might
                                 work for a lifetime in the class in which he was
                                 born, and at the end still find Eugenia far from him.
                                 He must rise above his work and his people, he must
                                 cut his old name anew, he must walk rough-shod
                                 where his mind led him—among men who were his
                                 superiors only in the accident of a better birthright.
                                 And if on that higher plane his ambitions did not
                                 betray, he would bring honour to his State and to
                                 Eugenia.

                                 out boldly.  The old romantic fervour with which he
                                 had longed for the days of Marshall and Madison, of
                                 Jefferson and Henry, still lingered on as an exotic
                                 patriotism in an era of time-servers and unprofitable
                                 servants.  There was an old-fashioned democracy
                                 about him—a pioneer simplicity—as one who had
                                 walked from the great days of Virginia into her
                                 lesser ones.  A century ago he might have left his
                                 plough to fight, and, having fought, might have
                                 returned thereto; but the battle would have tingled in

                                 his blood and the furrows have gone crooked.  He
                                 would have ploughed, not for love of the plough, but
                                 because the time for the sowing of the grain had
                                 come.

                                 Eugenia in the woods, in the sunshine, in the very
                                 clouds lifted high above.  The thought of her
                                 surrounded him as an atmosphere.

                                 When she came into the hall in the early afternoon,
                                 with her trowel in her hand and her sleeves rolled
                                 back from her white arms, her father called her to

                                 one of the cane chairs.  He sprang to his feet as she
                                 reached the threshold, and held out his hand, but she
                                 laughed and showed the earth that clung to her
                                 wrists.  “Unclean!  unclean!” she cried gaily.  Her
                                 face had flushed from its warm pallor and her hair
                                 hung low upon her forehead.  A long streak of clay
                                 lay across her skirt where she had knelt in the
                                 flower-bed.

                                 holding the trowel in her hand.  She was watching
                                 the interest in her father's face, and she realised,
                                 half resentfully, that it was evoked by Dudley
                                 Webb.

                                 from him, and they had plunged together into a
                                 discussion of the good old days.  After a few
                                 light words she sat silent, listening with tender
                                 attention to the threadbare stories on the one side
                                 and the hearty applause of them on the other.  She
                                 wondered wistfully why Dudley and herself were
                                 the only persons who understood as well as loved
                                 the general.  Why was it Dudley, and not Nicholas,
                                 who brought that youthful look to his face and the
                                 heartiness to his voice?

                                 absorption in his subject which won him a friend in

                                 with Jake Preston twenty times.  I was standing by
                                 him when he got that bullet in his thigh.  Did he tell

                                 at Dudley, but when she reached the garden it was
                                 of Nicholas she was thinking.  There was a glow at
                                 her heart that kept alive the memory of his eyes as
                                 he looked at her in the wood, of his voice when he
                                 called her name, of his hand when it brushed her
                                 own.

                                 out, an hour later, to find her, she was singing softly
                                 as she uprooted a scarlet geranium.
                              </p>

                                 occur to him to join in the transplanting as Nicholas
                                 would have done.  He held off and absorbed the

                                 gratefully.  “I hope you will come out whenever you
                                 are in Kingsborough.”

                                 buried in the flower-bed, her firm arms rising white
                                 above the rich earth.  The line of her bosom rose
                                 and fell swiftly, and her breath came in soft pants.
                                 There was a flush in her cheeks.

                              <p id="d44710e5646">His temperament responded promptly to the
                                 appeal of her beauty, and his blood quickened as it
                                 did when women moved him.  There was about him,
                                 withal, a fantastic chivalry which succumbed to the
                                 glitter of false sentiment.  He would have made the
                                 remark had Eugenia been plain—but he would not
                                 have come to Kingsborough.

                                 quietly.  She had the sexual self-poise of the Virginia
                                 woman, and she weighed the implied compliment at
                                 its due value.  Had he declared he would die for her
                                 once a week, she would have received the
                                 assurance with much the same smiling indifference.

                                 spend the night with Eugenia, and the girls sat
                                 before the log fire in Eugenia's room until they
                                 heard the cocks crow shrilly from the hen-house.
                                 The room was a large, old-fashioned chamber, full
                                 of dark corners and unsuspected alcoves; and the
                                 lamp on the bureau served only to intensify the
                                 shadows that lay beyond its faint illumination.

                                 and the light of the logs on her bare arms, was
                                 stretched upon the hearth-rug, looking up at
                                 Eugenia, who lay in an easy-chair, her feet almost
                                 touching the embers.  A waiter of russet apples was
                                 on the floor beside them.

                                 sleepily as she munched an apple.  “No men and no

                                 a love.  I wore it yesterday, and Dudley said it

                                 enough to make you overlook it.  Is that your Plato?

                                 of housekeeping.  She was not touched by such

                                 way concerned in them.  She spent six hours a day
                                 with her servants, but had she spent twenty-four she
                                 would have remained secure in her conviction that

                                 Kingsborough,” she said, “and I'd preserve every
                                 inch of it with my own hands if I could—but I can't
                                 bear meetings—and—and things.”

                              <p id="d44710e5832">Mrs. Webb took a careful stitch in the damask.
                                 “I thought you might care enough to assist us,” she
                                 remarked tentatively; and Eugenia succumbed.

                              <p id="d44710e5837">“I'll do anything I can,” she declared.  “I will,
                                 indeed—only you mustn't expect much.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5841">In a few moments she rose to go, lingering with a
                                 courteous appearance of being unwilling to depart,
                                 which belonged to her social training.  As she stood
                                 in the doorway, her hand in Mrs. Webb's, the older
                                 woman looked at her almost affectionately.

                              <p id="d44710e5844">“I had a letter from Dudley this morning,” she
                                 said.  “He is coming down next week for Sunday.”

                              <p id="d44710e5847">A flush crossed Eugenia's face, evoking an
                                 expression of irritation.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5850">“You must miss him,” she observed
                                 sympathetically.

                              <p id="d44710e5853">“I do miss him, but he comes often.  He is a good
                                 son.  He sent a message to you, by the way, but it
                                 was not important.”

                              <p id="d44710e5856">“No, it was not important,” repeated Eugenia
                                 with a feeling that her carelessness appeared to be
                                 assumed.

                              <p id="d44710e5860">She lightly kissed Mrs. Webb and ran down the
                                 steps and into the carriage, which was waiting in the
                                 road.  Her visit had left her with a curious sense of
                                 oppression, and she breathed a long draught of the
                                 invigorating air.

                              <p id="d44710e5863">As she drove down the street she saw Nicholas
                                 coming out of his office and offered him a “lift” to
                                 his home.  He said little on the way, and his
                                 utterances were forced, but Eugenia talked lightly
                                 and rapidly, as she always did when with him.

                              <p id="d44710e5866">She told him of Sally Burwell, of the last letter
                                 from Bernard—who was coming home soon—of
                                 Mrs. Webb and the “Daughters of Duty.”

                                 he said bitterly.  “But every one does that—even
                                 the judge, though he doesn't say anything.  And they
                                 are right—I see it.  You know from what I came
                                 and what I am.”

                              <p id="d44710e5878">“Yes, I know what you are,” she returned
                                 defiantly, “and they shall all know some day.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5881">He turned and looked at her as she sat beside
                                 him, but he was silent, nor did he speak until he said
                                 “good-bye” before his father's gate.

                              <p id="d44710e5884">It was some days later that she saw him again.
                                 She had gone out to gather goldenrod for the great
                                 blue vases that stood on the dining-room
                                 mantelpiece, and was standing knee-deep in the
                                 ragged field, when he leaped the fence that divided
                                 the farms and crossed to where she stood.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5887">The sun was going down behind the blackened
                                 branches of the dead oak, and the wide common,
                                 spread with goldenrod and life-everlasting, lay like a
                                 sea of flame and snow.  Eugenia, standing in its
                                 midst, a tall woman in a dress of brown, fell in richly
                                 with the surrounding colours.  Her arms were filled
                                 with the yellow plumes and her dress was tinselled
                                 with the dried pollen that floated in the air.  As
                                 Nicholas reached her she was seeking to free
                                 herself from the clutch of a crimson briar that
                                 crawled along the ground, and in the effort some of
                                 the broken stalks slipped from her hold.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5890">Without speaking, he knelt beside her and
                                 released her skirt.  “You have torn it,” he said
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e5892"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="221" data-tei-n="229"> </a></span>
                                 quietly, but he was looking up at her, and there was
                                 a quality in his voice which thrilled her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5895">“Have I?” she returned quickly.  “Well, I can
                                 mend it—but there!  it's caught again.  I've been
                                 trying to get free for—hours.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5899">He smiled.</p>

                                 ago.  I saw you.  But, hold on.  I'll uproot this

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5905">He tore it from its tenacious hold to the earth and
                                 flung it into the field.  Then he examined the rent in
                                 Eugenia's dress.
                              </p>

                                 spared yourself this—patch,” he observed.

                              <p id="d44710e5914">“Don't I always come—when there's a patch to
                                 be saved?” he asked.  “I hate to see things ruined.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5918">“Then you might have come sooner.  There, give

                              <p id="d44710e5921">He began patiently to gather up the stalks,
                                 arranging them in an even layer of equal lengths.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5924">Eugenia watched him, laughing.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5927">“How precise you are!” she said.</p>

                                 approval, and she saw that he had grown singularly
                                 boyish.  His face was less rugged, more sensitive.
                                 He wore no hat, and his thick red hair had fallen
                                 across his forehead.  She felt the peculiar power of
                                 his look as she had felt it before.

                                 hers she noticed that they were cold.  “You're
                                 shaking them all apart,” he protested, “and I
                                 took such a lot of trouble.”
                              </p>

                                 coil of hair to the white nape of her neck where her
                                 collar rose.  Several loose strands had blown across
                                 her ear and wound softly about the delicate lobe.
                                 He wanted to raise his hand and put them in place,
                                 but he checked himself with a start.  With his eyes
                                 upon her he recalled the warmth of her woollen
                                 dress, and he wished that he had put his lips to it as
                                 he knelt.  She would never have known.

                              <p id="d44710e5945">Then, by a curious emotional phenomenon, she
                                 seemed to be suddenly invested with the glory of the
                                 sunset.  The goldenrod burned at her feet and on her
                                 bosom, and her fervent blood leaped to her face.
                                 The next moment he staggered like a man
                                 blinded by too much light—the field, with Eugenia
                                 rising in its midst, flamed before his eyes, and he
                                 put out his hand like one in pain.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5948">“What is it?” she asked quickly, and her voice
                                 seemed a part of the general radiance.  “You have
                                 been looking at the sun.  It hurts my eyes.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5951">“No,” he answered steadily, “I was looking at
                                 you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5954">She thrilled as he spoke and brought her eyes to
                                 the level of his.  Then she would have looked away,
                                 but his gaze held her, and she made a sudden
                                 movement of alarm—a swift tremor to escape.  She
                                 held the sheaf of goldenrod to her bosom and above
                                 it her eyes shone; her breath came quickly between
                                 her parted lips.  All her changeful beauty was
                                 startled into life.

                              <p id="d44710e5960">“Genia!” he said softly, so softly that he seemed
                                 speaking to himself.  “Genia!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5963">“Yes?” She responded in the same still whisper.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5966">“You know?”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5969">“Yes, I know,” she repeated slowly.  Her glance
                                 fell from his and she turned away.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e5979">There was a gasp in her voice.  She turned to
                                 move onward—a briar caught her dress; she
                                 stumbled for an instant, and he flung out his arms.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5982">“You know it is impossible,” he said, and kissed
                                 her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e5985">The sheaf of goldenrod loosened and scattered
                                 between them.  Her head lay on his arm, and he felt
                                 her warm breath come and go.  Her face was
                                 upturned, and he saw her eyes as he had never
                                 seen them before—light on light, shadow on
                                 shadow.  He looked at her in the brief instant as a
                                 man looks to remember—at the white brow—the
                                 red mouth, at the blue veins, and the dark hair, at
                                 the upward lift of the chin and the straight
                                 throat—at all the perfect colouring and the
                                 imperfect outline.

                                 her from him.

                                 stunned.  “I must go,” she said breathlessly.  “I must

                              <p id="d44710e5995">Then she hesitated and stood before him, her
                                 hands on her bosom, a single spray of goldenrod
                                 clinging to her dress.

                              <p id="d44710e6009">“I shall always love you,” he went on.  “You may
                                 as well know it.  Men change, but I do not.  I have
                                 never really loved anybody else.  I have tried to love
                                 my family, but I never did.  When I was a little, God-forsaken
                                 chap I used to want to love people, but I
                                 couldn't—I couldn't even love the judge—whom I
                                 would die for.  I love you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6013">“I know it,” she said.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6016">“If you will wait I will work for you.  I will work
                                 until they let me have you.  I don't mean that I shall
                                 ever be good enough for you—because I shall not
                                 be.  I shall always be a brute beside you—but if you
                                 will wait I will win you.  I swear it!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6019">She had not moved.  She was as still as the dead
                                 oak that towered above them.  The sunset struck
                                 upon her bowed head and upon the quiet bosom,
                                 where her hands were clasped.

                              <p id="d44710e6022">“I will wait,” she answered.</p>

                                 good as he at vaulting bars.  Now her long skirts
                                 retarded her, and she laughed as she came quickly
                                 to the ground on the opposite side.

                                 left her and went homeward along the road. The
                                 sun had gone slowly down and the western horizon
                                 was ripped open in a deep red track.  The charred
                                 skeleton of the oak loomed black and sinister against
                                 the afterglow, and at its feet the glory went out of
                                 the autumn field.  Straight ahead the sound of shots
                                 rang out where a flock of bats circled above the
                                 road.  On the darkening landscape the lights began to
                                 glimmer in farmhouses far apart, and to Nicholas
                                 they seemed watchful, friendly eyes that looked
                                 upon him.  All Nature was watchful—all the
                                 universe friendly.  The glow which irradiated his

                                 the glow of universal joy, though he knew it to be
                                 but the vanishing beam of youth and the end

                                 supreme good which, in his limited observation, he
                                 had never seen put forth in the lots of others.  His
                                 own life lay so much nearer the Divine purpose than
                                 did the lives of his neighbours—the purpose of
                                 Nature, whose end is the happiness that conforms
                                 to sane and immutable laws.  His kiss on Eugenia's
                                 lips was to him God-given; the answer in her eyes
                                 had flamed a Scriptural inspiration.  In the
                                 tumultuous leaping of his thoughts it seemed to him
                                 that the meaning of existence lay unrolled—a
                                 meaning obscured in all religions, overlooked in all
                                 philosophies—a meaning that could be read only by
                                 the lamp that was lit in the eyes that loved.

                                 confident way, while passion throbbed in his pulses
                                 and youth quickened in his brain.

                                 vases and sat in the deserted dining-room thinking
                                 of Nicholas.  Where the damask curtains were
                                 drawn back from the windows a gray line of twilight
                                 landscape was visible, and a chill, transparent dusk
                                 filled the large room.  Outside she would see the box-walk,
                                 a stretch of lawn, broken by flower-beds, and
                                 the avenue of cedars leading to the highway.  From
                                 the porch floated the smoke of the general's pipe.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6081">Her brow was on her hand and she sat so
                                 motionless that the place seemed deserted, save for
                                 an errant firefly that vainly palpitated in the gloom.
                                 The glow that had flamed beneath Nicholas's kiss
                                 still lingered in her face, and she was conscious of a
                                 faint, almost hysterical impulse to weep.  The fever
                                 in her veins had given place to a still tremor which
                                 ran through her limbs.  At first she felt rather than
                                 thought.  She lapsed into an emotional reverie as
                                 delicate as the fragrance of the October roses on
                                 the table.  There was a sensation of softness as
                                 when one lies full length in sunshine or is caressed
                                 by firelight.  She felt it pervade her body even to the
                                 palms of her hands.  Then her quick mind stirred,
                                 and she recalled the pressure of his arms, the light
                                 in his eyes, the quiver of his lips as they touched her
                                 hands.  His strength had dominated her and it still
                                 held her—the firm note in the voice that trembled,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6083"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="228" data-tei-n="236"> </a></span>
                                 the power in the hand that appealed, the almost
                                 savage vigour in the arms that he folded on his
                                 breast.  She had succumbed less to his gentleness
                                 than to the knowledge that it was she alone who
                                 evoked that gentleness out of a nature almost
                                 adamantine, wholly masculine.  His faults she knew
                                 to be the faults of one who had hewn his own road
                                 in life—a rugged surface—a strain of rigidity
                                 beneath —at worst a tendency to dogmatise—and
                                 knowing as she did her own control over them, they
                                 attracted rather than repelled her.

                                 manhood there was mingled with an emotion
                                 half-maternal the memory of her own guardianship
                                 of his stunted childhood.  To a woman at once rashly
                                 spirited and profoundly feminine the pathos of his
                                 boyish struggle appealed no less forcibly than did
                                 the virility of his manhood.  She might have loved
                                 him less had her thought of him been untouched by
                                 pity.

                                 Kingsborough, and upon the first evening of his visit
                                 he walked out to Battle Hall.  He was looking
                                 smooth and well groomed, and the mass of his thick
                                 dark hair waving over his white brow gave him an
                                 air of earnestness and ardour.  Eugenia wondered
                                 that she had never noticed before that he was like
                                 the portrait of an old-time orator, and that his hands
                                 were finely rounded.

                              <p id="d44710e6139">His voice, with its suggestion of suavity, fell
                                 soothingly on her nerves.  She had never liked him
                                 so much, and she had never shown it so plainly.
                                 Once as she met his genial gaze she held her breath
                                 at the marvel that he should grow to love her, and in
                                 vain.  Was it that beside his splendid shallows

                                 the more luminous depths of Nicholas's nature
                                 still showed supreme?  Or was it a question of fate
                                 —and of first and last?  Had Dudley come upon her
                                 in the red sunset, in the little shanty beside the road,
                                 would she have gone out to him in the mere leaping
                                 of youth and womanhood?  Or was it something more
                                 unerring still—more profound—the prophetic call of individual to
                                 individual, despite the specious pleading of the race?
                                 But she put the thought aside and returned
                                 casually to Dudley.

                                 but his chief claim to her regard lay in the fact that
                                 it was the general, and not herself, whom he
                                 endeavoured to propitiate.

                                 what was called the “sitting-room,” “I find your
                                 story about the fighting Texans capped by one
                                 Major Mason was telling me last night about the

                                 hear that story about 'em when I was wounded?”

                                 of flattering absorption on his face.

                                 and drew up his chair.

                                 Lee surrendered—well, sir, I was propped up there
                                 close by a company of those raw-boned
                                 mountaineers from North Carolina, and they stood
                                 as still as the pine wood behind 'em, while their
                                 colonel swore at 'em like mad.

                                 scraggy fellows stood stock still and sung out:

                                 singing in my ears before that company charged the
                                 enemy to a man—and whipped 'em, too, sir—

                                 Eugenia, sitting with her hands in her lap, followed
                                 the conversation with abstracted interest.

                                 over to her and took her hand.

                                 for it.”

                                 turned away, and she was conscious that he had
                                 seen and misconstrued the senseless blush.  It was
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6196"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="232" data-tei-n="240"> </a></span>
                                 her misfortune to go red or pale without cause and to
                                 show an impassive face above deep emotion.

                              <p id="d44710e6199">The next morning she rode with Dudley, and the day
                                 after he came out before returning to Richmond.  She
                                 experienced a certain pleasure in the contact with his
                                 bouyant optimism, but it was not without a sensation of
                                 relief that she watched him depart after his last visit.  It
                                 seemed to leave her more to herself—and to Nicholas.

                              <p id="d44710e6202">That afternoon she walked with him far across the
                                 fields, and they laid together phantasmal foundations of
                                 their future lives.  Perhaps the chief thing to be said of
                                 their intercourse was that it was to each a mental
                                 stimulant as well as an emotional delight.  Eugenia's quick,
                                 untutored mind, which had run to seed like an
                                 uncultivated garden, blossomed from contact with his
                                 practical, unpolished intellect.  He taught her logic and a
                                 little law; she taught him poetry and passion.  He argued
                                 his cases to her and swept her back into the days of his
                                 old political dreams—dreams from which he had
                                 awakened, but which still hovered as memories in his
                                 waking hours.  Sometimes he brought his books to Battle
                                 Hall, and they read together beneath the general's unseeing
                                 eyes; but more often they sat side by side in the pasture or
                                 the wood, the volume lying open between them.  He was
                                 the first man who had ever spurred her into thought; she
                                 was the first woman he had ever loved.

                                 drifted back to the question of themselves and their own
                                 happiness.  It was only a matter of waiting, she said, of
                                 the patient passage of time; and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6207"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="233" data-tei-n="241"> </a></span>
                                 they were so sure of each other that all else was
                                 unimportant—to be disregarded.

                              <p id="d44710e6214">It was not a personal distrust of Eugenia that he
                                 voiced; it was the hardened state of disbelief in his own
                                 happiness which showed itself when the first intoxication
                                 of passion was lived out.

                              <p id="d44710e6217">“Why, of course you are,” she readily rejoined.  “Am I
                                 not sure of you?  You are as much mine as my eyes—or
                                 my hand.”

                              <p id="d44710e6220">“Oh, I am different!” he exclaimed.  “A beggar doesn't
                                 prove faithless to a princess—but what do you see in
                                 me, after all?”

                              <p id="d44710e6223">She laughed.  “I see a very moody lover.”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6226">They had reached a little deserted spring in the

                                 beside him, and his own closed over it.  As it did so,
                                 she contrasted its hardened palm with the smooth
                                 surface of Dudley Webb's.  The contrast touched
                                 her, and, with a swift, warm gesture, she raised the
                                 clasped hands to her cheek.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6263">“I told you once I liked your hand,” she said.
                                 “Well—I love it.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6266">He turned upon her a hungry glance.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6270">“I would work it to the bone for you,” he
                                 answered.  “But—it is long to wait.”

                              <p id="d44710e6273">“Yes, it is long to wait,” she repeated, but her
                                 tone had not the heaviness of his.  Waiting in its
                                 wider sense means little to a woman—and in a
                                 moment she cheerfully returned to a prophetic
                                 future.

                                 Nicholas less often.  Her affection for her brother,
                                 belonging, as it did, to the dominant family feeling
                                 which possessed her soul, was filled with an almost
                                 maternal solicitude.  He absorbed her with a
                                 spasmodic, half selfish, wholly insistent appeal.  She
                                 received his confidences, wrote his letters, and tied

                                 the greater part of his time in Kingsborough; now
                                 he rode in seldom, and invariably returned in a
                                 moody and depressed condition.

                                 his arm.  It was characteristic of her that no call for
                                 affection went disregarded—that the sensitive
                                 fibres of her nature quivered beneath any caressing
                                 hand.

                              <p id="d44710e6291">“Don't I?”  He laughed his impulsive, boyish
                                 laugh—“I'll prove it by letting you go in for the mail
                                 this afternoon.  I detest Kingsborough!”

                                 on her hat.  When she came down Bernard was not
                                 in sight, and she drove off, wondering why he or
                                 any one else should detest Kingsborough.

                                 having finished work for the day, when, in passing
                                 along the main street, she saw him come to the door

                                 recognised as Bessie Pollard.

                                 she caught sight of his visitor she gave them both a

                                 on.  She felt vaguely offended and sharply irritated
                                 with herself for permitting it.  Her annoyance was

                                 not allayed by the fact that Amos Burr stopped her
                                 in the road to inform her that his wife was fattening
                                 a brood of turkeys which she would like to deliver
                                 into the hands of Miss Chris.  As he stood before
                                 her, hairy, ominous, uncouth, she realised for the
                                 first time the full horror of the fact that he was
                                 father to the man she loved.  Hitherto she had but
                                 dimly grasped the idea.  Nicholas had been
                                 associated in her thoughts with the judge and her
                                 earlier school days; and she had conceived of his
                                 poverty and his people only in the heroic measures
                                 that related to his emancipation from them.  Now
                                 she felt that had she, in the beginning, seen him side
                                 by side with his father, she could not have loved
                                 him.  She flinched from Amos Burr's shaggy exterior
                                 and drew back haughtily.

                                 her gaze, and she had put up her hand to push them
                                 aside, when her father's voice reached her, and at

                                 looked white and drawn.

                                 into Bernard's face.  She made an appealing

                                 poker, divided the smouldering log.  A red flame shot
                                 up, illuminating the gathered faces that stood out
                                 against the dusk.  The glare lent a grotesque irony to
                                 the flabby, awe-stricken features of the general,
                                 brightened the boyish ill-humour in Bernard's eyes,
                                 and played peaceably over Miss Chris's tranquil
                                 countenance.

                                 soothing hand.

                                 the avenue, and out again to the open road.  The
                                 sunset colours were flaming in the west, and above
                                 them a solitary star was shining.  The fields lay
                                 sombre and deserted on either side, but straight
                                 ahead, in the lighter streak of the road, she saw
                                 Nicholas's figure swinging onward.  She might have
                                 called to him, but she did not; she sped like a
                                 shadow in his path until, hearing her footfalls in the
                                 dust, he looked back and halted.

                              <p id="d44710e6505">She came up to him, her hand at her throat, her
                                 face turned towards the sunset.  For a moment her
                                 breath failed and she could not speak; then all the
                                 words that she had meant to say—the appeal to him
                                 for truth, the cry of her own belief in him—rang
                                 theatrical and ineffectual in her brain.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6508">When at last she spoke, it was to voice the mere
                                 tripping of her tongue—to utter words which belied
                                 the beating of her thoughts.

                                 not; he regarded her gravely, with a grim inquiry.

                                 into their faces.  Overhead other stars came out,
                                 and far away an owl hooted.

                                 the supreme test, his sense of humour failed him.
                                 He met grave issues with a gravity that upheld them.

                                 out a despairing hand for hope, but he did not notice
                                 it.  She was softening to him—if she had ever
                                 steeled herself against him—and a single summons
                                 to her faith would have vanquished the feeble
                                 resistance.  But he did not make it—the inflexible

                                 in them.  The arrogant pride of a strong man, plainly

                                 brutal in its passion.

                                 the distance Eugenia turned and went back through
                                 the cedar avenue.  She walked heavily, and there
                                 was a bruised sensation in her limbs as if she had
                                 hurt herself upon stones.  A massive fatigue
                                 oppressed her, and she stumbled once or twice over
                                 the rocks in the road.  Her happiness was dead, this
                                 she told herself; telling herself, also, that it had not
                                 perished by anger or by disbelief.  The slayer loomed
                                 intangible and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6584"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="244" data-tei-n="252"> </a></span>
                                 yet inevitable—the shade that had arisen from the
                                 gigantic gulf between separate classes which they
                                 had sought, in ignorance, to abridge.  The pride of
                                 Nicholas was not individual, but typical—the pride
                                 of caste, and it was against this that she had sinned
                                 —not in distrusting his honour, but in offending it.  It
                                 was in the clash of class, after all, that their theories
                                 had crumbled.  He might come back to her
                                 again—she might go forth to meet him—but the
                                 bloom had gone from their dreams—in the reunion
                                 she saw neither permanence nor abiding.  The
                                 strongest of her instincts—the one that made for the
                                 blood she bore—had quivered beneath the onslaught
                                 of his accusation, but had not bent.  Wherever and
                                 whenever the the struggle came she stood, as the
                                 Battles had always stood, for the clan.  Be it right or
                                 wrong, true or false, it was hers and she was on its side.

                                 branches brushed her face, like the remembering
                                 touch of familiar fingers, and she put up her cheek
                                 to them as if they were sentient things.  Long ago
                                 they had soothed her as a troubled child, and now
                                 their caresses cooled her fever.  Underfoot she felt
                                 the ancient carpet they had spread throughout the
                                 century—and it smoothed the way for her heavy
                                 feet.  She was in the state of subjective passiveness
                                 when the consciousness of external objects alone
                                 seems awake.  She felt a tenderness for the twisted
                                 box bushes she brushed in passing, a vague pity for
                                 a sickly moth that flew into her face; but for
                                 herself she was without pity or tenderness—she
                                 had not brought her mind to bear upon her own
                                 hurt.

                                 and she could not eat.  A lump rose in her throat,
                                 and she saw the kindly, accustomed faces through a
                                 gathering mist.  She regarded each with a certain
                                 intentness, a peculiar feeling that there were hidden
                                 traits in the commonplace features which she had
                                 never seen before—a complexity in the benign
                                 candour of Miss Chris's countenance, in the
                                 overwrought youthfulness of Bernard's, in the
                                 apoplectic credulity of the general's.  Familiar as
                                 they were, it seemed to her that there were latent
                                 possibilities—obscure tendencies, which were
                                 revealed to her now with microscopic exaggeration.

                                 sense of security.  She felt a sudden impulse to
                                 draw nearer in the shelter of the race—to cling
                                 more closely to that unswerving instinct which had

                                 Then she rubbed her cheek against his brown linen
                                 sleeve, which was redolent of tobacco.  The firm
                                 physical contact inspired her with the courage of
                                 life; it seemed to make for her a bulwark against
                                 the world and its incoming tribulations.

                              <p id="d44710e6660">Once in her room she threw open the window and
                                 sat looking out into the night, the chill autumn wind
                                 in her face.  Far across the fields a pale moon was
                                 rising, bearing a cloudy circle that betokened rain.  It
                                 flung long, ghostly shadows east and west, which
                                 flitted, lean and noiseless and black, before the
                                 wind.  Overhead the stars shone dimly, piercing a
                                 fine mist.  Eugenia leaned forward, her chin on her
                                 clasped hands.  Beyond the gray blur of the pasture
                                 she could see, like benighted beacons, the lights in
                                 Amos Burr's windows, and she found herself
                                 vaguely wondering if Nicholas were at his books—
                                 those books that never failed him.  He had that
                                 consolation at least—his books were more to him
                                 than she had been.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6663">She was not conscious of anger; she felt only an
                                 indifferent weariness—a nervous shrinking from the
                                 brutality of his rage.  His face as she had seen it
                                 rose suddenly before her, and she put her hand to
                                 her eyes as if to shut out the sight.  She saw the
                                 clear streak of the highway, the gray pasture, the
                                 solitary star overhanging the horizon, and she felt
                                 the dead leaves blown against her cheek from
                                 denuded trees far distant.  And lighted by a glare of
                                 memory she saw his face—she saw the convulsed
                                 features, the furrow that cleft the forehead like a
                                 seam, the heavy brows bent above the half-closed
                                 eyes, the spasmodic working of the drawn mouth.
                                 She saw the man in whom, for its brief instant, evil
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6665"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="248" data-tei-n="256"> </a></span>
                                 was triumphant—in whom that self-poise, which
                                 had been to her as the secret of his strength, was
                                 tumultuously overthrown.

                                 emerged, defeated, from a physical contest.  Her
                                 hands trembled, and something throbbed in her
                                 temple like an imprisoned bird.

                                 and Miss Chris came in, bearing a lamp in her hand.

                                 fireplace, and she threw on fresh wood, watching
                                 while it caught and blazed up lightly over the old
                                 brass and irons.

                                 smooth, florid face had a fine moisture over it that
                                 showed like dew on a well-sunned peach.

                                 he has a great deal of family pride, you know,
                                 though he was so wild in his youth.  But I remember
                                 my father once saying: ‘A Battle may go a long way
                                 down the wrong road, but he'll always pull up in time
                                 to turn.’ ”

                                 placid mouth formed a round hole above her
                                 dimpled chin, giving her large face an expression
                                 almost infantile.  She took up the key basket, which
                                 she had placed on the mantel-piece, cast a glance at
                                 the pile of logs to see if it had been replenished, felt
                                 the cover on the bed, after inquiring if it sufficed,
                                 and, with a cheerful “good-night,” passed out,
                                 closing the door behind her.

                              <p id="d44710e6715">Eugenia did not turn as the door closed.  She
                                 stood motionless upon the hearth rug, looking down
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6717"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="250" data-tei-n="258"> </a></span>
                                 into the fire.  Something in the huge old fireplace,
                                 with its bent andirons supporting the blazing logs, in
                                 the increasing bed of embers upon the bricks, in the
                                 sharp odour of the knot of resinous pine she had
                                 thrown on with the hickory, brought before her the
                                 winter evenings in Delphy's little cabin, when they
                                 sat upon three-legged stools and roasted early
                                 winesaps.  She saw the negro faces in the glow of
                                 the hearth, and she saw Nicholas and herself sitting
                                 side by side in the shadow.  His childish face, with
                                 its look of ancient care, came back to her with the
                                 knotted boyish hands that had carried and fetched at
                                 her bidding.  The whole wistful little figure was
                                 imaged in the flames, melting rapidly into the boy,
                                 eager to act, ardent to achieve, who had bidden her
                                 good-bye on that November afternoon, and,
                                 dissolving again, to reappear as the strong man who
                                 had come upon her in Uncle Ish's little shanty,
                                 bearing the old negro's bag upon his shoulder.

                                 so ready to assist, so forgetful of services which he
                                 had rendered?  There was none so powerful and yet
                                 so kind—so generous or so gentle.  An impulse
                                 stirred her to cross the fields to his door and fling
                                 herself into the breach that divided them; but again
                                 the phantom in the flames grew dim and then sent
                                 out the face that she had seen that afternoon—
                                 convulsed and quivering, with its flitting
                                 sinister likeness to Amos Burr.  A voice that seemed
                                 to be the voice of old dead Aunt Griselda—of her
                                 whole dead race that had decayed and been
                                 forgotten, and come

                              <p id="d44710e6731">The resinous pine blazed up, the pungent odour
                                 filled the large room, and from the lightwood sticks
                                 tiny streams of resin oozed out and dripped into the
                                 embers, turning the red to gray.

                                 was a noise as of the soughing of the wind in the

                                 longer she stood motionless; then, turning from the
                                 fire, she threw herself upon the floor to weep until
                                 the daybreak.

                                 blindly towards his father's gate.  The rage which
                                 had stunned him into silence before the girl now
                                 leaped and crackled like flame in his blood.  His
                                 throat was parched and he saw red like a man who
                                 kills.

                              <p id="d44710e6752">Passing his home, he kept on to Kingsborough,
                                 and once within the shadow of the wood, he broke
                                 into a run, flying from himself and from the goad of
                                 his wrath.  As he ran, he felt with a kind of alien
                                 horror that to meet Bernard Battle face to face in
                                 this hour would be to do murder—murder too mild
                                 for the man who had lied away his friend's honour
                                 for the sake of the whiteness of his own skin.  It was
                                 the injustice that he resented with a holy rage—the
                                 hideous fact that a clean man should be spotted to
                                 save an unclean one the splashing he merited.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6755">And Eugenia also—he hated Eugenia that he had
                                 kept her image untarnished in his thoughts; that he
                                 had allowed the desire for no other woman to
                                 shadow it.  He had held himself as a temple for the
                                 worship of her; he had permitted no breath of
                                 defilement to blow upon the altar—and this was his
                                 reward.  This—that the woman he loved had hurled
                                 the first stone at the mere lifting of a Pharisaical
                                 finger—that she had loved him and had turned from
                                 him when the first word was uttered—as she would
                                 not have turned from the brother of her blood

                                 had he been damned in Holy Writ.  It was for this
                                 that he hated her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6760">The light of the sunset shining through the wood
                                 fell dull gold on his pathway.  A strong wind was
                                 blowing among the trees, and the dried leaves were
                                 torn from the boughs and hurled roughly to the
                                 earth, when they sped onward to rest against the
                                 drifts by the roadside.  The sound of the wind was
                                 deep and hoarse like the baying of distant hounds,
                                 and beneath it, in plaintive minor, ran the sighing of
                                 the leaves before his footsteps.  Through the wood
                                 came the vague smells of autumn—a reminiscent
                                 waft of decay, the reek of mould on rotting logs, the
                                 effluvium of overblown flowers, the healthful smack
                                 of the pines.  By dawn frost would grip the
                                 vegetation and the wind would lull; but now it blew,
                                 strong and clear, scattering before it withered
                                 growths and subtle scents of death.

                              <p id="d44710e6764">Out of the wood, Nicholas came on the highway
                                 again, and turned to where the afterglow burnished
                                 the windows of Kingsborough.  He followed the
                                 road instinctively—as he had followed it daily from
                                 his childhood up, beating out the impression of his
                                 own footsteps in the dust, obliterating his old, even
                                 tracks by the reckless tramp of his delirium.

                              <p id="d44710e6767">When he reached the college grounds he paused
                                 from the same dazed impulse and looked back upon
                                 the west through the quiet archway of the long brick
                                 building.  The place was desolate with the desolation
                                 of autumn.  Through the funereal arch he saw the
                                 sunset barred by a network of naked branches,
                                 while about him the darkening lawn was veiled with
                                 the melancholy drift of the leaves. The only sound
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e6769"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="254" data-tei-n="262"> </a></span>
                                 of life came from a brood of turkeys settling to
                                 roost in a shivering aspen.

                              <p id="d44710e6772">He turned and walked rapidly up the main street,
                                 where a cloud of dust hung suspended.  Past the
                                 court-house, across the green, past the little
                                 white-washed gaol, where in a happier season roses
                                 bloomed—out into the open country where the
                                 battlefields were grim with headless corn rows—he
                                 walked until he could walk no further, and then
                                 wheeled about to retrace heavily his way.  His rage
                                 was spent; his pulses faltered from fatigue, and the
                                 red flashes faded from before his eyes.

                                 entered.  “Sairy Jane's gone to bed with a headache
                                 and ma's in a temper.  I'll get you something as soon

                                 member of his race who had blazed the thorny path
                                 before him.  A strange, pathetic figure rose suddenly
                                 in his vision—a man with a great brow and a twisted

                                 her soiled apron.  His gaze fell upon her, and he
                                 wondered angrily whence sprung her indomitable
                                 energy—the energy that could expend itself upon
                                 potatoes.  Her face was sharpened until it seemed to
                                 become all feature—there were hollows in the
                                 narrow temples, and where the pale, thin hair was
                                 drawn tightly over the head he could trace the
                                 prominent bones of the skull.

                              <p id="d44710e6827">As he looked at her his own petty suffering was
                                 overshadowed by the visible tragedy of her life—
                                 the sordid tragedy where unconsciousness was
                                 pathos.  He reached out quickly and took a corner of
                                 her apron in his hand.  It was the strongest
                                 demonstration of affection he had ever made to her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6830">“I'll sort them, ma,” he said lightly.  “There's not
                                 a speck in the lot of them too fine for my eyes.”
                                 And he knelt down beside the earthy heap.

                              <p id="d44710e6833">But when he went up to his room an hour later
                                 and lighted his kerosene lamp, it was not of his
                                 stepmother that he was thinking—nor was it of
                                 Eugenia.  His stiffened muscles contracted in
                                 physical pain, and his brain was deadened by the
                                 sense of unutterable defeat.  The delirium of his
                                 anger had passed away; the fever of his skin had
                                 chilled beneath the cold sweat that broke over
                                 him—in the reaction from the madness that had

                                 of a sanity almost sublime.  The habitual
                                 balance of his nature had swung back into place.

                                 been reading and held it unopened in his hands.  He
                                 stared straight before him at the whitewashed wall
                                 of the little room, at the rough pine bedstead, at the
                                 crude washstand, at the coloured calendar above.

                                 learning.  He came to him a tragic figure in
                                 mire-clotted garments—a youth with aspiring eyes
                                 and muck-stained feet.  He wondered what had
                                 been his history—that unknown labourer who had
                                 sought knowledge—that philosopher of the plough
                                 who had died in ignorance.

                                 has done.  It would be a dull world without the

                                 maple syrup from the old silver jug.  “If Helen of

                                 walked with him to his office, and, seeing Bessie
                                 Pollard, red-eyed and drooping in her father's door,
                                 he lingered an instant and held out his hand.  There
                                 was defiant sympathy in his act—disdain of the
                                 judgment of Kingsborough—and of General Battle,
                                 who was passing—and pity for a bruised common
                                 thing that looked at him with beautiful, mindless
                                 eyes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6943">“You aren't looking bright to-day,” he said kindly,
                                 “but things will pull through, never fear—they
                                 always do, if you give them time.”

                              <p id="d44710e6946">Then he responded coolly to the general's cool
                                 nod, and, rejoining Tom, they went on arm in arm.
                                 In his large-minded manhood it had not occurred to
                                 him to connect the girl with the wrong done upon
                                 him—he knew her to be more weak than wicked,
                                 and, in her soft, pretty sadness, she reminded him of
                                 a half-drowned kitten.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6949">During the next few months he frequently passed
                                 Eugenia in the road.  Sometimes he did not look at
                                 her, and again he met her wistful gaze and spoke
                                 without a smile.  Once he checked an eager
                                 movement towards him because he had met
                                 Bernard just ahead—and he hated him; once he had
                                 seen the

                                 carriage in the distance and had waited in a
                                 passionate rush of remorse and love to hear her
                                 laughter as she talked with Dudley Webb.  They had
                                 faced each other at last with resolute eyes and
                                 unswerving wills.  On his side was the pride of an
                                 innocent man accused, the bitterness of a proud
                                 man on an inferior plane; on hers, the recollection of
                                 that wild evening in the road, and the belated
                                 recognition of the debt she owed her race.

                              <p id="d44710e6954">In the winter she went up to Richmond and he
                                 slowly forced himself to renounce her.  He began to
                                 see his old dream as it was—an emotional chimera;
                                 a mental madness.  As the year grew on he watched
                                 his long hope wither root and branch, until, with the
                                 resurrection of the spring, it lay still because there
                                 was no life left that might put forth.  And when his
                                 hope was dead he told himself that his unhappiness
                                 died with it, that he might throw himself single-hearted
                                 into the work of his life.

                                 budded, expanded, fell again.  Eugenia watched their
                                 growth, fulfilment, and decay as she had watched
                                 them other seasons, though with eyes a thought
                                 widened by experience, a shade darkened by tears.
                                 At first she had suffered wildly, then passively, at
                                 last resignedly.  The colour rebloomed in her cheek,
                                 the gaiety rang back to her voice, for she was
                                 young, and youth is ever buoyant.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e6968">There was work for her to do on the place, and
                                 she did it cheerfully.  She studied farming with her
                                 father and overhauled the methods of the overseer,

                                 inspired her with such serene self-poise?  He
                                 questioned these things, but he did not hesitate.  He
                                 was of a Virginian line of lovers, and he charged in
                                 courtship as courageously as his father had charged
                                 in battle.  He was magnificent in his youthful ardour,
                                 and so fitted for success that it seemed already to
                                 cast a prophetic halo about his head.

                                 had not spoken.  “Send Sampson for Dr. Bright,
                                 and tell Delphy to bring pillows.  Give him to me.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7185">Her voice was firm, and there was no tremor
                                 in her large, helpful hands.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7188">When Eugenia returned, the general was still lying
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7190"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="270" data-tei-n="278"> </a></span>
                                 upon the hearth rug, his head supported by pillows.
                                 Miss Chris had opened one of the western
                                 windows, and a cool, damp air filled the room.  The
                                 rain had begun again, descending with a soft,
                                 purring sound.  Above it she heard the laboured
                                 breathing from the hearth rug, and in the firelight
                                 she saw the regular inflation of the swollen cheeks.
                                 The distended pupils stared back at her, void of light.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7193">As she stood motionless, her hands clenched
                                 before her, she followed the soft, weighty tread of
                                 Miss Chris, passing to and fro with improvised
                                 applications.  The light fall of the rain irritated her;
                                 she longed for the relentless downpour of the night.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7197">At the end of an hour the roll of wheels broke the
                                 stillness, and she went out to meet the doctor,
                                 passing, with a shiver, the unconscious mass on the
                                 floor.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7200">They carried him to his bed in the chamber next
                                 the parlour, and through the night and day he lay an
                                 inert bulk beneath the bedclothes.  Miss Chris and
                                 Eugenia and the servants passed in and out of his
                                 room.  One of the dogs came and sat upon the
                                 threshold until Eugenia put her arms about his neck
                                 and drew him away.  She had not wept; she was
                                 white and drawn and silent, as if the shock had
                                 dulled her to insensibility.  During the afternoon of
                                 the next day she persuaded Miss Chris to rest, and,
                                 softly closing the door, sat down in a chair beside
                                 her father's bed.  It was the high white bed that had
                                 known the marriage, birth, and death of a century of
                                 Battles.  In it her father was born; beside it, kneeling
                                 at prayer, her mother had died.  The stately tester
                                 frame had seen generations come and go, and
                                 had remained unchanged.  Now its stiff
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7202"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="271" data-tei-n="279"> </a></span>
                                 white curtains made a ghastly drapery above the
                                 purple face.

                              <p id="d44710e7205">Eugenia sat motionless, her thoughts vaguely
                                 circling about the still figure before her.  It was not
                                 her father—this she felt profoundly—it was some
                                 strange shape that had taken his place, or she was
                                 held by some farcical nightmare from which she
                                 should awake presently with a start.  The half-used
                                 glasses on the little table beside her; the candle
                                 burned down in the socket, and overlooked; the
                                 tightly corked phials of useless drugs; the strong
                                 odour of mustard from the saucer in which a plaster
                                 had been mixed—these things struck upon her
                                 faltering consciousness with a shock of horrible
                                 reality.  The odour of the mustard was more real
                                 than the breathing of the body on the bed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7208">As she sat there, she thought of her mother—the
                                 pale, still woman who had lain beautiful and dead
                                 where her father was dying now.  She came to her
                                 as from a faded miniature, wistful, holy, at rest—
                                 blessed and above reproach.  Her heart went out to
                                 her as to one standing near, hidden by the long
                                 white curtains—nearer than Aunt Chris asleep
                                 upstairs, nearer than Bernard, who was coming to
                                 her, nearer than the great form on the bed.  Closer
                                 than all other things was that spiritual presence.
                                 Then she thought of her old negro mammy, who
                                 had died when she was but a baby—her mother's
                                 nurse and hers.  She recalled the beloved black face
                                 beneath the snowy handkerchief, the restful bosom
                                 in blue homespun, the tireless arms that had rocked
                                 her into slumber.  Then of Jim, the dog, true friend
                                 and faithful playmate.  All the lives that she had loved
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7210"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="272" data-tei-n="280"> </a></span>
                                 and had been bereft of gathered closer, closer in the
                                 gray shadows.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7213">Her gaze passed to the window, seeking in the sad
                                 landscape the little graveyard where they were
                                 lying.  The rain came between her and the clouded
                                 hill—descending softly and insistently between her
                                 eyes and the end of her search.  Against the panes
                                 the dripping branches of the shivering mimosa tree
                                 beat themselves and moaned.  A chill seized her and,
                                 rising, she went to the hearth, noiselessly piling wood
                                 upon the charred and waning logs, which crumbled
                                 and sent up a thin flame.  She hurried to the bed and
                                 sat down again, her eyes on the blanket that rose
                                 and fell with the difficult breath.  As she looked at
                                 the large, familiar face, tracing its puffed outline and
                                 gross colouring, it resolved itself into her earliest
                                 remembrance—throughout her childhood he had
                                 been her slave and she his tyrant.  What wish of hers
                                 had he ever ignored?  With what demand had he
                                 ever failed to comply?  At the end of the long life
                                 what had remained to him except herself—the single
                                 compensation—the one reward?  The pity of it smote
                                 her as with a lash.  He had lived with such fine
                                 bravery, and he had had so little—so little, and yet
                                 more than myriads of the men that live and die.  That
                                 live and die!  About her and beyond her she seemed
                                 to hear the rushing of great multitudes—the passing
                                 of the countless souls through the gates of death.

                              <p id="d44710e7216">With a cry she threw herself upon her knees,
                                 beseeching the dull ears.
                              </p>

                                 and the sun came out they buried him beside his
                                 wife in the little graveyard.  For days after the
                                 funeral Eugenia wandered like a shadow through
                                 the still rooms.  Bernard had come and gone,
                                 carrying with him his short, sharp grief.  Miss Chris
                                 had put aside her own sorrow and gone back to the
                                 management of the house; only the girl, worn, idle,
                                 tragic, haunted the reminders of her loss.  Coming
                                 upon the general's old slouch hat on the rack, she
                                 had grasped it in sudden passionate longing; at the
                                 sight of his half-filled pipe she had rushed from the
                                 room and from the house.  The faint scent of
                                 tobacco about the furniture was a continual torture
                                 to her.  In the great chamber next the parlour she
                                 would sit for hours, staring at the cold white bed,
                                 shivering before the tireless hearth.  The place
                                 chilled her like a vault; but she would linger
                                 wretchedly until led away by Miss Chris, when she
                                 would sob upon that broad, unselfish bosom.

                              <p id="d44710e7225">December passed; the unsunned earth turned
                                 itself for a winter rest.  January came, swift and
                                 changeful.  With February a snowstorm swept from
                                 the north, driving southward.  At first they felt it in
                                 the air; then the swollen clouds chased overhead; at
                                 last the white flakes arrived, falling, falling, falling.
                                 Through the night the storm made a glistening
                                 mantle for the darkness; through the day it hid
                                 sombre sky and sombre earth in a spotless veil.  It
                                 covered the far country to the distant forests; it
                                 weighted the ancient cedars until their green
                                 branches bent to earth; it wrapped the gravelled
                                 walk in a winding sheet; it filled the hollows of the
                                 box bushes until they hardened into hills of ice.  The
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7227"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="274" data-tei-n="282"> </a></span>
                                 snow was followed by cold winds.  The ground
                                 froze in the night.  Long icicles formed on the naked
                                 trees, the window panes bore a lacework of frost.

                              <p id="d44710e7230">One afternoon, when the landscape was white
                                 and hard, Eugenia went out into the deserted sheep
                                 pasture where the dead oak stood.  A winter sunset
                                 was burning like a bonfire in the west, and as far as
                                 the red horizon swept an unbroken waste of snow.
                                 The rail fences shone silver in their coat of frost,
                                 and from the blackened tree above her pendants of

                                 gaunt crows flew, casting purple shadows.

                                 vacantly at the landscape—at the sunset, and at the
                                 waste of snow, across which flitted the demoniac
                                 shadows of the crows.  Her eyes saw only the
                                 desolation and the death; they were sealed to the
                                 grandeur.

                                 with the loneliness of nature.  Her own
                                 isolation—the isolation of a strong soul in
                                 pain—walled her apart as with a wall of ice.  That
                                 assurance of human companionship on which she
                                 had based her future seemed suddenly annihilated.
                                 She was alone and life was before her.

                                 broke upon the field of snow, coming towards her.
                                 It was Dudley Webb, and in the resolute swing of
                                 his carriage, in the resistless ardour of his eyes, he
                                 seemed to reach her from east and west, from north
                                 and south, surrounding her with a warmth of summer.

                              <p id="d44710e7281">The Democratic State Convention had taken an
                                 hour's recess.  From the doors of the opera house of
                                 Powhatan City the assembled delegates emerged,
                                 heated, clamorous, out of breath.  The morning
                                 session, despite its noise, had not been interesting
                                 —awaiting the report of the Committee on
                                 Credentials, the panting body had fumed away the
                                 opening hours.  Of the fifteen hundred
                                 representatives of absent voters, the favoured few
                                 who had held the floor had been needlessly
                                 discursive and undeniably dull.  There had been
                                 overmuch of the party platform, and an absence of
                                 the wit which is the soul of political speaking; and,
                                 though the average Virginia Convention is able to
                                 breast triumphantly the most encompassing wave of
                                 oratory, the present one had shown unmistakable
                                 signs of suffocation.  At the end of the third speech,
                                 metaphor had failed to move it, and alliteration had
                                 ceased to evoke applause.  It had heard without
                                 emotion similes that concerned the colour of
                                 Cleopatra's hair, and had yawned through
                                 perorations that ranged from Socrates to the Senior
                                 Senator, who sat upon the stage.  Attacks upon the
                                 “cormorants and harpies
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7283"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="277" data-tei-n="288"> </a></span>
                                 that roost in Wall Street” had roused no thrill in the
                                 mind of the majority that knew not rhetoric.  The
                                 most patient of the silent members had observed
                                 that “after all, their business was to nominate a
                                 candidate for governor,” while the unruly spirits, as
                                 they brandished palm-leaf fans, had wished “that
                                 blamed committee would come on.”

                              <p id="d44710e7286">Now, after hours of restless waiting, they emerged,
                                 stiff-kneed and perspiring, into the blazing sunshine
                                 that filled the little street.  Once outside, they opened
                                 their lungs to the warm air in an attempt to banish
                                 the tainted atmosphere of the interior; but the original
                                 motive of expansion was lost in a flow of words.  On
                                 the sidewalk the crowd divided into streams, pulsing
                                 in opposite directions.  Heated, noisy, pervasive, it
                                 surged to dinners in hotels and boarding-houses, and
                                 overflowed where Moloney's restaurant displayed its
                                 bill of fare.  It came out talking, it divided talking; still
                                 talking, it swept, a roaring sea of flesh, into the far-off
                                 buzz of the distance.  In a group of three men
                                 passing into the lobby of the largest hotel, there was
                                 a slender man of fifty years, with a well-knit figure,
                                 half closed, indifferent eyes, and an emphatic mouth.
                                 In the insistent hum of words about him, his voice
                                 sounded in a brisk utterance that carried a hint of
                                 important issues.

                                 was saying.  “I'd bet on a close shave between
                                 Webb and Crutchfield, with Webb in the lead.  Small
                                 will get the lieutenant-governorship, of course.
                                 Davis ought to be attorney-general, but he'll be
                                 beaten by Wray.  It's the party reward.

                                 Davis is the better lawyer, by long odds, but Wray

                                 them with emphatic sentences in which the name of
                                 Crutchfield sounded like a refrain.  Moving from
                                 group to group, portly, unctuous, insinuating, a man
                                 with an oily voice was doing battle in the cause of Webb.

                                 from the glass stand in the centre of the table.  “We
                                 think a man deserves something who hasn't missed
                                 a convention for fourteen years.”

                                 good-humour about the group, which showed it to be,
                                 in the main, indifferent to the result—an attitude in
                                 vivid contrast to the effervescent partisanship of the
                                 leaders.  With the exception of the colonel, whose
                                 heart was in his dinner, they appeared to be
                                 unconcerned spectators of the events of the day.

                                 week,” said Diggs, as he waited for his dessert.  “It
                                 was about the time he seconded the nomination of
                                 Reed for attorney-general—ever hear it?”

                                 in his chair.  The colonel's stories were the platform
                                 which had supported him throughout a not
                                 unsuccessful social career.

                                 know, just beginning to be heard of as an advocate.
                                 He was at his first convention, eager to have his
                                 say, hard to keep silent; and he was asked to
                                 second the nomination of Reed, a boyish-looking
                                 chap of twenty-six.  He didn't know Reed from
                                 Adam, but he was ambitious to be heard just
                                 then—and he'd have spoken for the devil if they'd
                                 have given him a chance.  Well, he launched out on
                                 his speech in fine style.  He began with Noah—as
                                 they all did in

                                 those days—glided down the centuries to Seneca
                                 and Caesar, touched upon Adam Smith and
                                 Jefferson, and finally landed in the arms of Monroe
                                 P. Reed.  There he grew fairly ecstatic over his
                                 subject.  He spoke of him as ‘the lawyer sprung,
                                 fullarmed, from the head of learning,’ as the
                                 ‘nonpareil Democrat who clove, as Ruth to Naomi,
                                 to the immortal principles of Virginia Democracy,’
                                 and in a glorious period, he rounded off ‘the
                                 incomparable services which Monroe P. Reed had
                                 rendered the deathless cause of the Confederacy!’
                                 In an instant the house came down.  There was a
                                 roar of laughter, and somebody in the gallery sang
                                 out: ‘He was at his mother's breast!’
                              </p>

                                 left him.  He faced the man in the gallery like Apollo
                                 come to judgment, and his fine voice rang to the
                                 roof.  ‘I know it, sir, I know it,’ he thundered, ‘but
                                 Monroe P. Reed was one of the stoutest
                                 breastworks of the Confederacy.  I have it from his
                                 mother, sir!’

                              <p id="d44710e7417">“Of course the house went wild.  He was the
                                 youngest man on the floor, and they gave him an
                                 ovation.  Since then, he's learned some things, and
                                 he's become the only orator left among us.”

                                 was placed before him, and did not speak again
                                 during dinner.

                              <p id="d44710e7424">“He is an orator,” said Galt.  “He doesn't use
                                 much clap-trap business either.  I've never heard
                                 him drag in the Medes and Persians, and I could
                                 count his classical quotations on my fingers.
                                 Personally, I like Burr's way better—it's saner and it's
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7426"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="285" data-tei-n="296"> </a></span>
                                 sounder—but Webb knows how to talk, and he has
                                 a voice like a silver bell—Ah, here he is.”

                                 doorway and Dudley Webb entered and took the
                                 nearest vacant seat.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7432">The first impression of him at this time was one
                                 of extreme picturesqueness.  A slight tendency to
                                 stoutness gave dignity to a figure which, had it been
                                 thin, would have been insignificant, and served to
                                 accentuate a peculiar grace of curve which
                                 prevented his weight from carrying any suggestion
                                 of the coming solidity of middle age.  His rich, rather
                                 oily hair, worn longer than the fashion, fell in
                                 affected carelessness across his brow and lent to
                                 his candid eyes an expression of intensity and
                                 eloquence.  His clear-cut nose and the firm, fleshy
                                 curve of his prominent chin modified the effect of
                                 instability produced by his large and somewhat
                                 loosely moulded lips.  The salient quality of his
                                 personality, as of his appearance, was an ease of
                                 proportion almost urbane.  His presence in the
                                 overcrowded room diffused an infectious affability.
                                 Though he spoke to few, he was at once, and
                                 irrepressibly, the friend of all.  He did not go out of
                                 his way to shake a single hand, he confined his
                                 conversation, with the old absorption, to the men at
                                 his table—personal supporters, for the most part;
                                 but there was about him a pacific emanation—an
                                 atmosphere at once social and political, which
                                 extended to the far end of the room and to men
                                 whose names he did not know.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7435">He talked rapidly in a vibrant, low-toned voice,
                                 with frequent gestures of his shapely hands.  His

                                 laugh was easy, full, and inspiriting—the laugh of
                                 a man with a vital sense of humour.  As Galt
                                 watched him, he smiled in unconscious sympathy.

                                 farmer would have stamped his impress indelibly upon
                                 the plate—retaining that enduring aspect which comes
                                 from contact with natural forces—that integrity of type
                                 which is the sole survival of the Virginian pioneer.

                                 by its single note of colour the rigidity of his
                                 features.  His eyes—small, keen, deeply set beneath
                                 heavy brows—flashed from a dull opacity to an
                                 alert animation.  But in the first and last view of his
                                 face it was the mouth that marked the man; the
                                 straight, thin lips would close or unclose at their own
                                 will, not at another's—the line of the mouth, like the
                                 line of the hard, square jaw, was the physical
                                 expression of his character.  He was called ugly, but
                                 it was at least the ugliness of individuality—the
                                 ugliness of an unpolished force—of a raw, yet
                                 disciplined energy.  Now, as he stood at his full
                                 height upon the stage, his personality was felt
                                 before his words were uttered.  He had but one
                                 attribute of recognised oratory—a voice; and yet a
                                 voice so little vibrant as to seem almost without inflections.

                                 It was resonant, far-reaching, incisive; but it rang
                                 abruptly and without mellowness.

                                 heard from pit to gallery.  “It is perhaps
                                 unnecessary for me to state that I do not rise as an
                                 advocate of Mr. Webb.  I am neither his personal
                                 friend nor his political supporter, but in the year
                                 alluded to by the gentleman from Nottoway I was
                                 upon a committee appointed to investigate the
                                 charges which the gentleman from Nottoway has
                                 seen fit to revive.”  A silence had fallen in which a
                                 whisper might have been heard.  Every eye in the
                                 building was turned to where his outstanding mop of
                                 hair shone red against the smoke-stained wall.  “The
                                 charges were thoroughly investigated and
                                 emphatically withdrawn.  The gentleman from
                                 Nottoway has been misinformed or his memory has
                                 misled him—since there was abundant evidence
                                 brought before the committee to prove the
                                 suspicions against Mr. Webb's methods as a
                                 lobbyist to be absolutely without foundation.

                                 his eyes.  The faces in the pit were hidden behind a
                                 sea of handkerchiefs and hats—it was the response
                                 which a Virginia audience makes to a brave or a

                                 generous action.  “Hurrah for honest Nick!” yelled
                                 the floor, and “Go in and win yourself!” shouted a
                                 delegate from his own district.

                                 Better than the love of party is the love of honesty
                                 —and the Democracy of Jefferson cannot thrive
                                 upon falsehood.  Fair means are the only means,
                                 honest ends are the only ends.  The party owes its

                                 must be prolonged by artificial stimulants it is fit that

                                 “Honest Nick!  Honest Nick!” shouted the galleries,
                                 and the cry was echoed from the pit.  When order

                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7578"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="295" data-tei-n="306"> </a></span>
                                 fluttered from row to row.  The Webb leaders were
                                 whipping their faction into an enthusiasm that
                                 drowned the roll call.  At last, with the reading of the
                                 ballot, there was silence, followed by applause.
                                 Webb led slightly in advance of Crutchfield; Burr
                                 came next, Hartley last.  With the surprise of the
                                 third name, round which there had been a rally of
                                 uninstructed delegations, a cheer went up.  In the
                                 clamour Burr had risen to ask that his name be
                                 withdrawn, but the chorus of his newly formed
                                 followers howled him down.  Then Hartley was
                                 dropped from the race and a second ballot ordered.
                                 The excitement in the building could be felt like
                                 steam.  The heat was rising and a nervous tension
                                 weighted the atmosphere.  Through the clouds of
                                 tobacco smoke the records of changes sounded
                                 distinctly.  The Hartley delegation that Webb had
                                 counted on divided and went two ways; the county
                                 of Albemarle passed over to Burr; the city of
                                 Richmond broke its vote into three equal parts.

                              <p id="d44710e7581">Each change was received with a roar by the
                                 opposing factions—while the clerks stumbled on,
                                 making alteration upon alteration.  On the floor and
                                 the stage the chairmen thickened in the fight.  Ben
                                 Galt had sprung suddenly into life as Burr's
                                 manager, and in the aisle Tom Bassett, in his shirt
                                 sleeves, with a tally sheet in his hand, was inciting
                                 his battalion to victory.  About him the Webb men
                                 were summing up the votes needed to bring in their
                                 leader.  The noise had a dull, baying sound, as if the
                                 general voice were growing hoarse.  The odour of
                                 good and bad tobacco was dense and stifling.  In the
                                 midst of the clamour a drunken man rose to
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7583"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="296" data-tei-n="307"> </a></span>
                                 move that the convention consider the subject in
                                 prayer.

                                 confusion deepened.  The name of Crutchfield went
                                 down, and Burr and Webb ran hotly neck to neck.
                                 Then the Crutchfield party, which had held bravely
                                 together, began to go over, and, as each change was
                                 made, a shout went up from the successful force.
                                 Hall and Galt had established themselves on
                                 opposite sides of the stage and were working with
                                 drawn breath.  Galt, with a cigar in his mouth and a
                                 fan in his hand, was the only cool man in the house.
                                 He had caught the wave of popular enthusiasm
                                 before it had had time to break, and he was giving it
                                 no ground upon which to settle.  Tom Bassett in the
                                 centre aisle was cheering on his workers.  He was
                                 superb, but the Webb men were not behind him; it
                                 was still neck to neck.  Then, at last, with the third
                                 ballot, Burr led off, and the voting was over.
                              </p>

                                 of the convention in nominating the man he had tried
                                 to defeat.  The Caesar of Democracy was beaming,

                                 loyalty to principle.  Gentlemen, you have chosen
                                 well, and I pledge myself to uphold your nominee
                                 and to be the foremost bearer of your banner when
                                 it waves in next November from the line of

                                 remarked to Tom Bassett.  “He's a leader, pure and

                                 Kingsborough.  He had spent the week in Richmond,
                                 where he had lived for the past ten years, and he
                                 was now going back to receive the congratulations
                                 of the judge—as he would have gone twice the

                                 and leaning his head against the harsh, bristly plush
                                 of the seat, he had before him the usual examples
                                 of Southern passengers.

                                 the seat in front of him slouched a mulatto of the new
                                 era—the degenerate descendant of two races that mix
                                 only to decay.  Further off there were several men
                                 returning from business trips, and across from them
                                 sat a pretty girl, asleep, her hand resting on a gilded
                                 cage containing a startled canary.  At intervals she
                                 was aroused by the flitting figure of a small boy on
                                 the way to the cooler of iced water.  From the rear of
                                 the car came the amiable drawl of the conductor as
                                 he discussed the affairs of the State with a local
                                 drummer, whose feet rested upon a square leathern

                                 pleasantries with the conductor, and he had chatted for

                                 at last to the smoking-car.

                              <p id="d44710e7634">The low, irregular landscape was as familiar to
                                 him as his own face.  He knew it so well that he
                                 could see it with closed eyes—could note each
                                 change of expression where the daylight shifted,
                                 could tell where the thin cornfields ended and the
                                 meadows rolled fresh and green, could smell the
                                 stretch of young pines above the smoke of the
                                 engine, and could follow to their ends the
                                 rain-washed roads that crawled with hidden heads into
                                 the blue blur of the distance.  He knew it all, but he
                                 was not thinking of it now.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7637">He was thinking of the day, fifteen years ago,
                                 when he had left Kingsborough to throw himself and
                                 his future into the service of his State.  He had told
                                 himself then, fresh from the influence of Jefferson
                                 and the traditions of Kingsborough, that he had but
                                 one love remaining—the love of Virginia.  Now, with
                                 the bitterer wisdom of experience, that youthful
                                 romance showed half foolish, half pathetic.  To the
                                 man of twenty-three it had been at once the
                                 inspiration and the actuality.  His personal life had
                                 turned to ashes in an hour, and he had told himself
                                 that his public one, at least, should remain vital.  He
                                 had pledged himself to success, and it came to him
                                 now that the cause had been won by his
                                 single-heartedness—by the absolute oneness of his
                                 desire.  There had been a sole divinity before him,
                                 and he had not wandered in the way of strange
                                 gods.  He had given himself, and after fifteen years
                                 he was gaining his recompense—a recompense for
                                 more work than most men put into a lifetime.

                              <p id="d44710e7642">He smiled slightly as he thought of the beginning.
                                 In the beginning his sincerity had been laughed at,
                                 his ardour had met rebuff.  He had gone to
                                 Richmond to meet an assembly of statesmen; he
                                 had found a body of well-intentioned, but
                                 unprofitable servants.  They were men to be led, this
                                 he saw; and as soon as his vision was adjusted he
                                 had determined within himself to become their
                                 leader.  The day when a legislator meant a
                                 statesman was done with; it meant merely a man
                                 like other men, to be juggled with by shrewder
                                 politicians or to be tricked by more dishonest ones.
                                 They plunged into errors, and lived to retrieve them;
                                 they walked blindfold into traps, and with open eyes
                                 struggled out again.  For he found them honest and
                                 he found them faithful where their lights led them.
                                 He remembered, with a laugh, a New Englander
                                 who, after a fruitless winter spent in scenting the
                                 iniquities of the ruling party, had angrily exclaimed
                                 that “if politicians were made up of knaves and
                                 fools, Mason and Dixon's was the geographical line
                                 dividing the species.”  Nicholas had retorted, “If to
                                 be honest means to be a fool, we are fools!” and
                                 the New Englander had chuckled homeward.

                              <p id="d44710e7645">That was his first winter and he had been
                                 nobody.  Ah, it was hard work, that beginning.  He
                                 had had to fight party plans and personal prejudices.
                                 He had had to fight the recognised leaders of the
                                 legislature, and he had had to fight the men who
                                 pulled the strings—the men who stood outside and
                                 hoodwinked the consciences of the powers
                                 within.  He had had to fight, and he had fought well
                                 and long.

                                 the day when he had stood alone and the
                                 people—the great, free people, the beginning and
                                 the end of all democracies—had rallied to his
                                 standard.  He had won the people on that day, and
                                 he had never lost them.

                              <p id="d44710e7654">But he was of the party first and last.  In his youth
                                 he had believed in the divine inspiration of the
                                 Jeffersonian principles as he believed in God.  On the
                                 Democratic leaders he had thought to find the
                                 mantle of Apostolic Succession.  He had believed as
                                 the judge believed—with the passionate credulity of
                                 an older political age.  Time had tempered, but it had
                                 not dissipated, his fiery partisanship.  He sat to-day
                                 with the honours of a party upon him—honours that
                                 a few months would see ratified by a voice
                                 nominally the people's.  He laughed now as he
                                 remembered that Galt had said that in five years
                                 Dudley Webb would be the most popular man in the
                                 State.  “When Senator Withers stops delivering
                                 orations, there'll be a call for an orator, and Webb
                                 will arise,” he had prophesied.  “They don't need him
                                 now because the senator gets off speeches like hot
                                 cakes; but mark my words, the first time Webb is
                                 asked to make an address at the unveiling of a
                                 Confederate statue, there won't be a man to stand
                                 up against him in Virginia.  He's a better speaker
                                 than Withers—only the public doesn't know it, and
                                 there'll be hot times when it finds it out.”

                                 Outside a man was driving a plough across a field
                                 where grain had been harvested.  Nicholas followed
                                 with his eyes the walk of the horses, the
                                 purple-brown trail of the plough, the sturdy, independent

                                 figure of the driver as he passed, whistling an air.
                                 Over the Virginian landscape—the landscape of a
                                 country where each ragged inch of ground wears its
                                 strange, distinctive charm, where each rotting fence
                                 “worm” guards a peculiar beauty for those who
                                 know it—lay the warm hush of full-blown summer.

                              <p id="d44710e7662">The man at the plough aroused in Nicholas Burr a
                                 sudden exhilaration as of physical exertion.  It
                                 brought back his boyhood which had brightened as
                                 he had passed farther from it, and he felt that it
                                 would be good on such an afternoon to follow the
                                 horses across fields that were odorous of the
                                 upturned earth.

                                 of Southern trains, the man at the plough vanished,
                                 and Nicholas returned to his thoughts.

                                 flight.  He had put himself to a purpose, and he had
                                 lost sight of all things save its fulfilment.  The
                                 success that men spoke of with astonished
                                 eyes—the transformation of the barefooted boy into
                                 the triumphant politician, had a firm foundation, he
                                 knew, though others did not.  It was his capacity for
                                 toil that had made him—not his intellect, but his
                                 ability to persevere—the power which, in the old
                                 days, had successfully carried him through Jerry
                                 Pollard's store.  As chairman of the Democratic
                                 Party, men had called his campaigns brilliant.  He
                                 alone knew the tedious processes, the infinite
                                 patience front which these triumphs had
                                 evolved—he alone knew the secret and the
                                 security of his success.

                                 friendly touch upon his arm.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7680">He started abruptly from his reverie, lifted his bag,
                                 and left the car.  On the platform outside a group of
                                 stragglers recognised him, and there was a hearty
                                 cheer followed by frantic handshakes.  The incident
                                 pleased him, and he spoke to each man singly,
                                 calling him by name.  The sheriff was one of them,
                                 and the clerk of the court, and the old negro sexton
                                 of the church.  There was a fervour in their
                                 congratulations which brought the warmth to his
                                 eyes.  He was glad that the men who had known
                                 him in his poverty should rise so cordially to
                                 approve his success.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7683">He left the station, walking rapidly to the judge's
                                 house.  He had frequently returned to Kingsborough,
                                 but to-day the changes of the last fifteen years
                                 struck him with a sensation of surprise.  The wide,
                                 white street, half in sunshine, half in shadow, trailed
                                 its drowsy length into the open country where the
                                 roads were filled with grass and dust.  He noticed
                                 with a pang that the ivy had been torn from the
                                 church and that the glazed brick walls flaunted a
                                 nudity that was almost immodest.  He had
                                 remembered it as a bower of shade—a gigantic
                                 bird's nest.  He saw that ancient elms were rapidly
                                 decaying, and when he reached the judge's garden
                                 he found that the syringa and the lilacs had vanished.
                                 The garden had faced the destroyer in the plough,
                                 and trim vegetables thrived where gaudy blossoms
                                 had once rioted.

                                 bending above the mint bed, and he went over to him.

                                 hand, his kindly black face wrinkling with hospitality.
                                 “Marse George hev got de swelled foot,” he said in
                                 answer to a question, “an' he ain' tech his julep

                                 added, looking at the bunch in his hand.

                                 as he ascended the steps and entered the wide hall,
                                 through which a light breeze was blowing.

                                 lightening instinctively his heavy tread.  The judge
                                 was sitting in his great arm-chair, his white head
                                 resting against the cushioned back, his bandaged
                                 foot on a high footstool.

                              <p id="d44710e7701">“Is it you, my boy?” he asked, without turning.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7704">Nicholas crossed the room and gripped the
                                 out-stretched hand which trembled slightly in the air,
                                 the usual rugged composure of his face giving place
                                 to frank tenderness.

                              <p id="d44710e7711">The judge laughed and motioned to a chair
                                 beside his desk.  His fine dark eyes were as bright
                                 as ever, and there was a youthful ring in his voice.

                                 he responded.  ”The truth is, Caesar makes me live
                                 too high, the rascal—and I go on a bread-and-milk
                                 diet once in a while to spite him.”  Then his tone
                                 changed; he pushed aside a slender vase of “safrano”

                                 roses which shadowed Nicholas's face and
                                 regarded him with genuine delight.  “It's good news
                                 you bring me,” he exclaimed.  “I haven't had such
                                 news since they told me the Democratic Party had
                                 wiped out Mahonism.  And it was a surprise.  We
                                 thought Dudley Webb was too secure for the
                                 chances of the 'dark horse.'  Well, well, I'm sorry
                                 for Dudley, though I'm glad for you.  How did you
                                 do it?”

                              <p id="d44710e7719">Nicholas laughed, but his face was grave.  “Ben
                                 Galt says I worked up a political ‘revival,’ ” he
                                 replied.  “He declares my methods were for all the
                                 world the counterpart of those employed in a
                                 Methodist camp meeting, but he's joking, of course.
                                 It was a distinct surprise to me, as you know.  I had
                                 declined to offer myself as a candidate for the
                                 nomination, because I believed Webb to be assured
                                 of victory.  However, the Crutchfield party proved
                                 stronger than we supposed, and they came over to
                                 my side.  I was the 'dark horse,' as you say.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7722">“It's very good,” commented the judge.  “Very
                                 good.”

                                 change of heart’ won't last,” Nicholas went on, “but
                                 he knows, as I know, that I am the choice of the

                                 distrust me, the Democratic Party as a body has
                                 entire confidence in me.  You will understand that,
                                 had I doubted that the decision was free and
                                 untrammelled, I should not have accepted the
                                 nomination.”

                                 there was a triumphant zest in his voice.  His deeply-set

                                 quality, were now charged with light.  The thick red
                                 locks flared above his brow.

                                 exclamatory manner, and was silent.

                                 down here a week or two before the convention.  It
                                 seems that they are both anxious to return to
                                 Richmond to live.  She's a fine girl, is Eugie.  It was a
                                 terrible thing about that brother of hers, and she's
                                 never recovered from it.  I can't understand how the
                                 boy came to commit such a peculiarly stupid forgery.”

                                 judge, flinching from a twinge of gout and settling
                                 his foot more carefully upon the stool.  “He has
                                 been a fugitive from the State for years and a
                                 stranger to his wife and children.  There was always
                                 something extraordinary in the fact that he escaped
                                 after conviction, and I suppose there was a kind of
                                 honour in his not breaking his bail.  At

                                 least, that's the way Eugie seems to regard it—and
                                 it is such a pitiful consolation that we might allow
                                 her to retain it.  She tells me that Bernard's wife has
                                 been in destitute circumstances.  It's a pity!  it's a
                                 pity!  I had always hoped that Tom Battle's boy
                                 would turn out well.”

                                 the place had undergone repairs and improvements.
                                 The lawn had been cleared off and sown in grass,
                                 the fences had been mended, and the house had
                                 been painted white.  It could never suggest
                                 prosperity, but it had assumed an appearance of
                                 comfort.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7767">In the little room next the kitchen he heard his
                                 stepmother scolding a small negro servant, and he
                                 broke in good-humouredly upon her discourse.

                              <p id="d44710e7774">Marthy Burr turned and came towards him.  She
                                 had aged but little, and her gaunt figure and sharp
                                 face still showed the force of her indomitable spirit.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e7780">He took her in his arms and kissed her
                                 perfunctorily, for he was chary of caresses.  Then
                                 he lifted Nannie's baby from the floor and tossed it
                                 lightly.

                                 would name that child Marthy, an' it's the best

                                 the giant who held her, and set up a tearful
                                 disclaimer.  Nicholas returned her to the rug, where
                                 she attempted to swallow a string of spools, and
                                 looked at his stepmother.

                                 creases in her purple calico.

                                 diffidence that was rapidly waning.  “Marthy, if you
                                 swallow them spools, you won't have anything to

                                 memory of the very young—the streets leading
                                 from the Capitol were the streets of a Southern
                                 town— bordered by hospitable Southern houses set
                                 in gardens where old-fashioned flowers bloomed.
                                 Now the gardens are gone and the houses are
                                 outgrown.  Progress has passed, and in its wake
                                 there have sprung up obvious structures of red brick
                                 with brownstone trimmings.  The young trees leading
                                 off into avenues of shade soften the harshness of an
                                 architecture which would become New York, and
                                 which belongs as much to Massachusetts as to
                                 Virginia.

                                 figure in the Senate.  It was said of him that he had

                                 just now on the subject of corporations.  Charters

                                 and the eighth man said he'd go as the others went.
                                 My mind was so easy I lost sight of them for six
                                 hours, and every man John of them voted against
                                 the bill.  I believe you got in a little work in those six

                              <p id="d44710e7920">Galt pointed out the representative in question,
                                 and smiled because it was a man who had dined
                                 with him the evening before.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7923">“That he?” exclaimed the countryman
                                 contemptuously.  “Why, I've been down here sence
                                 Saturday, an' that young spark ain't opened his
                                 mouth.  I ain't heerd him mention Goochland sence I
                                 come.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7926">“Oh, there's time enough,” ventured Galt
                                 good-humouredly.  “He's young yet, and Goochland
                                 is immortal!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7929">“An' I reckon he gits fo' dollars same as the
                                 rest,” went on the stranger reflectively,  “jest for
                                 settin' thar an' whittlin' at that desk.  I used to study
                                 a good deal about politics fo' I come here, but they
                                 air jest a blamed swindle, that's what they air.”

                                 entered the elevator and ascended to the office of
                                 the chief executive.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7938">Reaching the landing he crossed a small gallery,
                                 where hung portraits of historic
                                 Virginians—governors in periwigs and lace ruffles
                                 and statesmen of a later age in high neckcloths.  At
                                 the end of a short passage he opened the door of
                                 the anteroom and faced the private secretary, who
                                 was busy with his typewriter.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7941">The secretary glanced up, recognised Galt, and
                                 gave a cordial nod.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7944">“The governor's got a gentleman in just now who
                                 called about the boundary line between Virginia and
                                 Maryland,” he said as Galt sat down.  “He wants to
                                 see you, though, so you'd better wait.  For a wonder
                                 there's nobody else here.  Two-thirds of the
                                 legislature were up a while ago.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7947">He spoke with an easy intimacy of tone, while the
                                 click of the typewriter went on rapidly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7950">Galt nodded in response and, as he did so, the
                                 door opened and the caller came out.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7954">“You're the very man!” exclaimed a hearty
                                 voice, and Nicholas Burr was holding out his hand.
                                 “Come in.  You're the only human being I know who
                                 is always the right man in the right place.  How do
                                 you manage it?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7957">He sat down before his desk, pushing aside the
                                 litter of letters and pamphlets.  “I should like you to
                                 glance over this list of appointments,” he went on.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7960">“It is what I dropped in about,” responded Galt.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7963">He flung himself into an easy chair and stretched
                                 his long legs comfortably before him.  He did not
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e7965"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="316" data-tei-n="327"> </a></span>
                                 take the list at once, but sat staring abstractedly at
                                 the freshly papered green walls above the large
                                 Latrobe stove whose isinglass doors shone like
                                 blood-shot eyes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7968">It was a long cheerful room with three windows
                                 which overlooked the grassy square.  There was a
                                 bright red carpet on the floor, and before the desk
                                 lay a gaudy rug enriched with stiff garlands. In one
                                 corner a walnut bookcase was filled with papers
                                 filed for reference, and the shelves across from it
                                 were lined with calf-bound “Codes of Virginia.”
                                 Among the pictures on the pale-green walls there
                                 were several of historic subjects—Washington
                                 among his generals and Lee mounted upon
                                 Traveller.  Over the mantel hung an engraving of the
                                 United States Senate with Clay for the central
                                 figure.  Beside the desk a cracker box was filled
                                 with unanswered letters.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7971">“Yes, I dropped in about that,” repeated Galt, his
                                 gaze returning to the rugged features of the man at
                                 the desk.  “You're not looking well, by the way.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7975">The other laughed.  “The office seekers have
                                 been at me,” he replied; “but I'm all right.  What
                                 were you going to say?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7978">His large, muscular hand lay upon the desk, and
                                 as he spoke he fingered an open pamphlet.  His
                                 penetrating eyes were on Galt's face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7981">Galt lifted the list of names and read it in silence.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7984">“A-ahem!” he said at last and laid it down; then
                                 he took it up again.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7987">“I have given a good deal of attention to the
                                 educational boards,” continued the governor slowly.
                                 “I do not think it is sufficiently realised that only

                                 men of the highest ability should be placed in

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7992">“Ah, I see,” was Galt's comment.  In a moment
                                 he spoke abruptly:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7996">“I say, Nick, has it occurred to you to ascertain
                                 the direction in which the influence of these men
                                 will go in the next senatorial election?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e7999">The other hesitated an instant.  “Frankly, I have
                                 done my best to put such questions aside,” he
                                 answered.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8002">Galt squared round suddenly and faced him;
                                 there was a decisive ring in his voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8005">“The next election comes in two years,” he said
                                 quietly.  “I have it on excellent authority that
                                 Withers will not seek to succeed himself.  His health
                                 has given out and he is going to the country.  Now,
                                 remove Withers, and there are two men who might
                                 take his place in the Senate.  You know whom I
                                 mean?”

                                 that race, and one of you will lose it.  It's going to be

                                 then let fly as much morality as you please; it won't
                                 hurt anybody there, heaven knows.  You are the
                                 man we need, and a few of us know it, though the
                                 majority may not.  But for the next two years give up
                                 trying to purify the Democratic Party.  The party's
                                 all right, and it's going to stay so.”

                              <p id="d44710e8036">“Then drop the habit,” replied Galt with an
                                 affectionate glance that softened the shrewd
                                 alertness of his look.  “My dear and valued friend, a
                                 successful politician does not have convictions; he
                                 has emotions.  Convictions were all right when
                                 Madison was President, but that gentleman has
                                 been in heaven these many years, and they don't
                                 thrive under the present administration.  A party man
                                 has got to be a party mouthpiece.  He may laugh and
                                 weep with the people, but he has got to vote with
                                 the party—and it's the party man who comes out on
                                 top.  Why, look at Withers!  Hunt about in his
                                 senatorial record and you'll find that he has voted
                                 against himself time out of number.  You and I may
                                 call that cowardliness, but the party calls it honour
                                 and applauds every time.  That applause has kept
                                 him the exponent of the machine and the idol of the
                                 people, who hear the fuss and imagine it
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8038"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="319" data-tei-n="330"> </a></span>
                                 means something.  Now Webb is like Withers, only
                                 smarter.  He is just the man to become a sounding
                                 brass reflector, and there's the danger.”

                                 already putting in a little quiet work in the
                                 legislature—and they have even been after the
                                 guards at the penitentiary.  Major Rann is your man,
                                 and he tells me the Webb leaders are the quietest,
                                 most insidious workers he has ever met.  As it is, he
                                 is your great card, and his influence is immense.
                                 Webb would give his right hand for him.”

                                 the ice-cream hasn't come.  Everything else is here.
                                 Did you get dinner downtown?”

                                 heaven's sake, let's have this over and settle down.  I
                                 only wish it were Carrie's wedding; then we might
                                 hope for a rest.”

                                 working like Turks.  Eugenia cut up every bit of the

                                 ever tasted.  Aren't those candelabra visions?  Emma
                                 lent them to me, and Mrs. Randolph sent her
                                 oriental lamps.  There's the bell now!  It must be
                                 Eugie's extra forks; she said she'd send them as

                                 one somebody brought the general from China
                                 fifty years ago.  Eugie is so careless.  She invited the

                                 reception rooms, where her eyes roved sharply
                                 over the decorations.

                                 rearranging a bowl of American Beauty roses.  “I
                                 got that new man to do them Mrs. Carrington told
                                 me about—Yes, Carrie, I'm coming!  Why, I
                                 declare, I haven't seen the baby since breakfast.

                              <p id="d44710e8155">And she rushed off to the nursery, followed by Galt.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8158">An hour later she was in the drawing-room again,
                                 her fair hair caught back from her plump cheeks,
                                 her white bosom shining through soft falls of lace.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8161">“I wonder how a man feels who isn't married to
                                 a beauty,” remarked Galt, watching her matronly
                                 vanity dimple beneath his gaze.  He was as much
                                 her lover as he had been more than twenty years
                                 ago when pretty Juliet Burwell had put back her
                                 wedding veil to meet his kiss.  The very exactions of
                                 her petted nature had served to keep alive the
                                 passion of his youth; she demanded service as her
                                 right, and he yielded it as her due.  The unflinching
                                 shrewdness of his professional character, the
                                 hardness of his business beliefs, had never entered
                                 into the atmosphere of his home.  Juliet possessed to
                                 a degree that pervasive womanliness which
                                 vanquishes mankind.  After twenty years of married
                                 life in which Galt had learned her limitations and her
                                 minor sins of temperament, he was not able to face
                                 her stainless bosom or to meet her pure eyes
                                 without believing her to be a saint.  In his heart he
                                 knew Sally Burwell to be a nobler woman than
                                 Juliet, and yet he never found himself regarding
                                 Sally through
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8163"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="325" data-tei-n="336"> </a></span>
                                 an outward and visible veil of her virtues.  Even
                                 Tom Bassett, who was married to her, had lost the
                                 lover in the husband, as his emotions had matured
                                 into domestic sentiment.  Galt had seen Sally wrestle
                                 for a day with one of her father's headaches, to be
                                 rewarded by less gratitude than Juliet would receive
                                 for the mere laying of a white finger on his temple
                                 —Sally's services were looked upon by those who
                                 loved her best as one of the daily facts of life;
                                 Juliet's came always as an additional bounty.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8167">To Galt himself, the different developments of the
                                 two women had become a source of almost
                                 humorous surprise.  After her marriage Sally had
                                 sunk her future into Tom's; Galt had submerged his
                                 own in Juliet's.  Behind Tom's not too remarkable
                                 success Galt had seen always Sally's quicker wit
                                 and more active nature; to his own ambitions, his
                                 love for Juliet had been the retarding influence.  He
                                 had been called “insanely aspiring” in his
                                 profession, and yet he had sacrificed his career
                                 without a murmur for the sake of his wife's health.
                                 He had sundered his professional interests in New
                                 York that he might see the colour rebloom in her
                                 cheek, and neither he nor she had questioned that
                                 the loss was justified.  In return she had rendered
                                 him a jealous loyalty and an absorbing wife-hood,
                                 and he had found his happiness apart from his
                                 ambition.

                              <p id="d44710e8170">Now she dimpled as he looked at her and he
                                 pinched her cheek.

                                 “they're changelings.”  He looked at Carrie, who was
                                 flitting nervously from room to room.

                              <p id="d44710e8181">“She's splendid!” protested Juliet.  “I never had
                                 such a figure in my life; Sally says so.  Carrie is a
                                 new woman, that's the difference.”

                                 Galt triumphantly; then he melted towards his
                                 daughter.  “I dare say she's stunning,” he observed.
                                 “Come here, Carrie, and bear witness that you're
                                 as handsome as your parents.”

                              <p id="d44710e8188">Carrie floated up, a straight, fine figure in white
                                 organdie, her smooth hair shining like satin as it
                                 rolled from her brow.  Her mouth and chin were too
                                 strong for beauty, but she was frank and clean and
                                 fresh to look at.

                                 upstairs, and in a moment several light-coloured
                                 gowns were fringed by the palms in the doorway.

                                 the rooms were filled with warmth and laughter and
                                 the vague perfume of women's dresses mingled
                                 with the odour of American Beauty roses.  An
                                 old-fashioned polka was in the air, and beyond the
                                 furthest doorway he saw young people dancing.  The
                                 red candles were burning down, and drops of wax
                                 lay like flecks of blood upon the floor.  Near the
                                 entrance, a small, dark woman was leaning upon a
                                 marble table, and as she saw him she held out a
                                 cordial hand.  She was plain and thin, with pale,
                                 startled eyes and a mouth that slanted upward at one
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8199"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="327" data-tei-n="338"> </a></span>
                                 corner, like a crooked seam.  She spoke in an

                                 fascination.

                                 you were never late, you would never be longed for.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8206">“My dear Miss Preston,” protested pretty little
                                 Mrs. Carrington, who was soft and drowsy, with
                                 eyes that reminded one of a ruminating heifer's.

                              <p id="d44710e8209">“I assure you, I have been positively longing to
                                 have you gratify my curiosity,” declared Miss
                                 Preston.  “You know you do such dear, eccentric
                                 things that we couldn't exist without you—at least I
                                 couldn't because I should perish of boredom.  No,
                                 you shan't escape just yet, so stop looking at that
                                 beautiful Mrs. Galt.  You must tell me first if it is
                                 really true that you once carried a woman out of a
                                 burning building in your right hand.  It is so delightful
                                 to be strong, don't you think?”

                                 animated chatter his gravity became almost
                                 grotesque.  “The only burning building I was ever in
                                 was a burning smoke-house,” he returned quietly.  “I
                                 never carried a woman out of anything in either
                                 hand.”

                              <p id="d44710e8215">There was a bored expression in his eyes, and he
                                 glanced beyond the group to where Juliet stood
                                 surrounded.

                                 on.

                                 were as plentiful as pinks in a garden bed, he moved

                                 awkwardly, with the hesitating steps of a man who
                                 is uncertain of his pathway.  His powerful frame and
                                 the splendid vigour in his daring strides seemed out
                                 of place amid a profusion of exotics that trembled
                                 as he passed.  His appearance suggested the
                                 battlegrounds of nature—high places, or the breadth
                                 of the open fields; at the plough he would have been
                                 grandly picturesque, in the centre of a throng of
                                 graceful men and women he loomed merely large
                                 and ill at ease.  Above his evening clothes his face
                                 showed rough, rather than refined, and his stubborn
                                 jaw gave an impression of heaviness.

                              <p id="d44710e8227">As he reached Juliet she uttered an exclamation
                                 of pleasure and held out her hand.  “Emma, you
                                 have heard of my Sunday-school scholar,” she said
                                 to a girl beside her.  “My prize scholar, I mean.
                                 Sally, have you seen the governor?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8230">Emma Carr, a pink-and-white girl who bore
                                 herself with the air of an acknowledged belle,
                                 bowed, with a platitude that sounded original on her
                                 lovely lips, and Sally Bassett turned with a hearty
                                 handshake.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8233">“And he is our Nick Burr!” she exclaimed.
                                 “Tom, where are you?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8236">She spoke with an impulsive flutter which he had
                                 remembered as the sparkle of mere girlish liveliness.
                                 Now he saw that it had degenerated into a
                                 restlessness that appeared to result from a
                                 continued waste of nervous energy.  She looked
                                 older than Juliet, though she was in fact much
                                 younger, and her face was drawn and heavily lined
                                 as if by years of ill-health.  Her physical strength
                                 was prodigious; one perceived it with the
                                 suddenness of surprise.  Much
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8238"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="329" data-tei-n="340"> </a></span>
                                 the same impression was produced by her youthful
                                 manner in connection with her worn features; yet,
                                 in spite of her faded prettiness, there was a singular
                                 charm in her unabated vivacity.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8241">She darted off in pursuit of Tom, to be arrested
                                 by the first newcomer she encountered, and
                                 Nicholas was responding gravely to Juliet's banter
                                 when his eyes fell full upon Eugenia Battle as she
                                 stood at a little distance.

                              <p id="d44710e8244">He had not seen her for fifteen years, and he
                                 started quickly as if from an unsuspected shock.
                                 She was talking rapidly in her fervent voice, the old
                                 illumination in her look.  Her noble figure, in a
                                 straight flaxen gown, was drawn against a
                                 background of green, her head was bent forward on
                                 her long white neck, her kindly hands were
                                 outstretched.  She had developed from a girl into a
                                 woman, but to him she was unchanged.  Her face
                                 was, perhaps, older, her bosom fuller, but he did not
                                 see it—to him she appeared as the resurrected spirit
                                 of his youth.  Miss Carr was speaking and he made
                                 some brief rejoinder.  Eugenia had turned and was
                                 looking at him; in a moment he heard her voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8248">“Are old friends too far beneath the eyes of your
                                 excellency?” she asked, and he heard the soft
                                 laugh pulse in her throat.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8251">Her hand was outstretched, and he took it for an
                                 instant in his own.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8254">“I am very glad to see you,” he remarked lamely
                                 as he let it fall—so lamely that he bit his lip at the
                                 remembrance.  ”You are looking well,” he added.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8257">“Of course—a woman always looks well at
                                 night,” she answered lightly.  “And you,” she
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8259"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="330" data-tei-n="341"> </a></span>
                                 laughed again, her kindly, unconscious laugh; “you
                                 are looking—large.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8262">He did not smile.  “I have no doubt of it,” he
                                 responded, and was silent.

                              <p id="d44710e8265">Juliet Galt broke in with an affectionate protest.
                                 “Eugie is as great a tease as ever,” she said.  “She
                                 will be the death of my baby yet.  I tell her to choose
                                 one of her own size, but she never does.  She
                                 always plagues those smaller than herself—or
                                 larger.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8269">But Eugenia had turned away to greet a stranger,
                                 and in a moment Nicholas drew back into a
                                 windowed embrasure where the lights were dim.
                              </p>

                                 Juliet Galt—the vibrant tones of Dudley Webb.  He
                                 had come in late and was standing in mock
                                 helplessness before Juliet and Carrie, his plump
                                 white hand vacillating between the two.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8275">“I am at a loss!” he exclaimed with an appealing
                                 shrug of his shoulders.  “Which is the debutante?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8278">Juliet laughed, her cheeks mantling with a pleased blush.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8281">“You're a sad flatterer, Dudley!  Isn't he, Eugie?”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8284">Eugenia turned with a questioning glance.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8288">“Oh, it's just his way,” she returned good-humouredly.
                                 “A kindly Providence has decreed that he should cover over
                                 my deficiencies.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8291">Dudley protested affably, and ended by giving a
                                 hand to each.  In the crowded rooms he had become
                                 at once the picturesque and popular figure.  His
                                 magnetism was immediately felt, and men and
                                 women surrounded him in small circles, while his
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8293"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="331" data-tei-n="342"> </a></span>
                                 pleasant words ran on smoothly, accompanied by
                                 the ring of his infectious laugh.  The luminous pallor
                                 of his clear-cut, yet fleshy face, was accentuated by

                                 of life.

                                 curiously the flutter of women's skirts and the

                                 men passed and repassed slowly on their way to
                                 and from the dining-room, pausing to exchange brief
                                 remarks and drifting on aimlessly.  Near them a fair,

                                 and turning into Grace Street strolled leisurely in the
                                 direction of the Capitol Square.  The night was sharp with
                                 frost and a rising wind drove the shadows on the
                                 pavement against darkened house-fronts, while behind a
                                 far-off church spire, a wizened moon shivered through a
                                 thin cloud.  On the silence came the sound of fire bells
                                 ringing in the distance.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8341">The bronze Washington in the deserted square shone
                                 silver beneath the moonlight, and down the frozen slopes
                                 the trees stretched out stiffened limbs.  From the
                                 governor's house a broad light streamed, and quickening
                                 his pace he entered the iron gate, which closed after him
                                 with a rheumatic cough, and briskly ascended the stone
                                 steps.  As he drew the latch-key from his pocket he was
                                 thinking of his library, where the firelight fell on cheerful
                                 walls and red leathern chairs, and with the closing of the
                                 door he crossed the hall and entered the first room on the
                                 left.

                              <p id="d44710e8344">A red fire burned in the grate, and the furniture
                                 reflected the colour until the place seemed pervaded by a
                                 visible warmth.  The desk in the centre of the room, the
                                 shining backs of law books, the crimson rugs, the
                                 engravings on the walls, the easy chair drawn up before
                                 the hearth, presented to him as he entered now the
                                 security of individual isolation.  He
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8346"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="334" data-tei-n="345"> </a></span>
                                 had felt the same sense of restfulness when he had
                                 ascended, after the day's work, to the little white-washed
                                 attic of his father's house.  To-night he liked the glow
                                 because it suggested warmth, but he could not have told
                                 off-hand the colour of the carpet or the subjects of the
                                 engravings on the wall; and had he found a white pine
                                 chair in place of the red leathern one, he would have used
                                 it without an admission of discomfort.  In the midnight
                                 hours he liked the empty house about him- the silence
                                 and the safeguard of his loneliness.  The deserted
                                 reception-rooms at the end of the hall pleased him by
                                 their stillness and the cold of their tireless grates.  Even
                                 the stiff, unyielding furniture, in its fancy dress of satin
                                 brocade, soothed him by its remoteness when he passed
                                 it wrapped in thought.

                                 which he read, and unfolded a newspaper lying upon his

                                 caught his eye, and he read it with curious intentness.

                                 Conscience.”  Once a member of the Senate had
                                 declared on the floor that the “two strongest factors
                                 in present State politics are found to be in the will of
                                 the people and the conscience of the governor.”  The
                                 morning papers had reported it, and when, several
                                 days later, he had vetoed a bill providing to place
                                 certain powers in the hands of a corporation that
                                 was backed by large capital, he had been hailed
                                 again as “The Man with the Conscience!”  Now he
                                 wondered as he read what the verdict would be to-morrow,
                                 when his refusal to sign a document which
                                 lay at that moment upon his desk must become
                                 widely known.  He had refused, not because the bill
                                 granted too great rights to a corporation, but
                                 because it needlessly restricted the growth of a
                                 railroad.  Would his refusal in this instance be
                                 dubbed “conscience” or “inconsistency”?

                                 desk, slowly lighted it.  As the smoke curled up, it
                                 circled in gray rings upon the air, filling the room
                                 with the aroma of the Virginia leaf.  He watched it
                                 idly, his mind upon the pile of unopened letters
                                 awaiting his attention.  Above the mantel hung a
                                 small oil painting of a Confederate soldier after Appomattox,
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8372"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="336" data-tei-n="347"> </a></span>
                                 and it reminded him vaguely of some one
                                 whom he had half forgotten.  He followed the trail
                                 for a moment and gave it up.  Higher still was an
                                 engraving of Mr. Jefferson Davis, with the
                                 well-remembered Puritan cast of feature and the
                                 severe chin beard.  Beneath the pictures a trivial
                                 ornament stood on the mantel and beside it a white
                                 rose in water breathed a fading fragrance.  A child
                                 who had come to feed the squirrels in the square
                                 had put the rose in his coat, and he had transferred
                                 it to the glass of water.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8376">He turned towards his desk and took up several
                                 cards that he had not seen.  So Rann had called in
                                 his absence—and Vaden and Diggs.  As he pushed
                                 the cards aside, he summoned mentally the men
                                 before him and weighed the possible values of each.
                                 Why had Rann called, he wondered—he had an
                                 object, of course, for he did not pay so much as a
                                 call without a purpose.  The name evoked the man
                                 —he saw him plainly in the circles of gray smoke—
                                 a stout, square figure, with short legs, his plaid socks
                                 showing beneath light trousers; a red, hairy face,
                                 with a wart in his left eyebrow, which was heavier
                                 than his right one; a large head, prematurely bald,
                                 and beneath an almost intellectual forehead, a pair
                                 of shrewd, intelligent eyes.  Rann was a match for
                                 any man in politics, he knew—the great, silent
                                 voice, some one had said—the man who was clever
                                 enough to let others do his talking for him.  Yes, he
                                 was glad that Rann would back him up.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8379">The remaining callers appeared together in his
                                 reverie—Vaden and Diggs.  They were never
                                 mentioned apart, and they never worked singly.  They
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8381"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="337" data-tei-n="348"> </a></span>
                                 were honest men, whose honesty was dangerous
                                 because it went with dull credulity.  In appearance
                                 they were so unlike as to make the connection
                                 ludicrous.  Vaden was long, emaciated, with a
                                 shrunken chest in which a consumptive cough
                                 rattled.  His face was scholarly, pallid, pleasant to
                                 look at, and there was a sympathetic quality in his
                                 voice which carried with it a reminder of past
                                 bereavements.  Beside the sentimental languor which
                                 enveloped him, Diggs loomed grotesquely fair and
                                 florid, with eyes bulging with joviality, and red,
                                 repellent, almost gluttonous lips.  He was a teller of
                                 stories and a maker of puns.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8384">They were both honest men and ardent
                                 Democrats, but they were in the leading strings of
                                 sharper politicians.  Perhaps, after all, the fools were
                                 more to be feared than the villains.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8387">Somewhere in the city a clock rang the hour, and,
                                 as his pipe died out, he rose and went to his desk.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8390">The next morning Vaden and Diggs dropped in to
                                 breakfast, and before it was over he had
                                 ascertained that they were seeking to sound him
                                 upon his attitude towards the recent National Party
                                 Platform.  As he dodged their laboured cross-examination
                                 he laughed at the overdone assumption
                                 of indifference.  Before they had risen from the
                                 table, Rann joined them, and the conversation
                                 branched at once into impersonal topics.  Diggs told
                                 a story or two, at which Rann roared appreciatively,
                                 while Vaden fingered his coffee spoon in pensive
                                 abstraction.

                              <p id="d44710e8393">As they left the dining-room, which was in the
                                 basement, and ascended to the hall, Diggs glanced
                                 into the reception-rooms and nodded respectfully at
                                 the brocaded chairs.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e8399">“I like the looks of that, governor,” he said, “but
                                 it's a pity you can't find a wife.  A woman gives an
                                 air to things, you know.”  Then he cocked an eye at
                                 the ceiling.  “This old house ain't much more than a
                                 fire trap, anyway,” he added.  “The trouble is it's
                                 gotten old-fashioned just like the Capitol building
                                 over there.  My constituents are all in favour of
                                 doing the proud thing by Virginia and giving her a
                                 real up-to-date State House.  Bless my life, the old
                                 Commonwealth deserves a brownstone front—now
                                 don't she?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8402">He appealed to Rann, who dissented in his broad,
                                 if blunt, intelligence.
                              </p>

                                 brownstone between here and New York harbour,”
                                 he declared.

                              <p id="d44710e8408">The governor laughed abstractedly, but a week
                                 later he recalled the proposition as he sat in Juliet
                                 Galt's drawing-room, and repeated it for the sake of
                                 her frank disgust.

                                 know she gets on dreadfully with Mrs. Webb—now
                                 doesn't she, Aunt Sally?”

                                 consider Mrs. Webb to be a terror, and Eugie's a

                                 the supreme expression of a type—of the joyous
                                 racial mother of all men.

                              <p id="d44710e8448">Her youngest child, a girl of three, that she called
                                 “baby,” had come in from a walk and was standing
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8450"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="340" data-tei-n="351"> </a></span>
                                 at her knee in white cap and cloak and mittens, her
                                 hand clutching Juliet's dress, her solemn eyes on the
                                 governor.  He had tried to induce her to approach,
                                 but she held off and regarded him without a smile.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8454">“Now, now, baby,” pleaded Juliet, “who fed the
                                 bunnies with you the other day?”
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e8482">“Noth.”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8485">“Yes, you do—you've forgotten.  Go and speak
                                 to him.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8488">The child approached gravely to make a grab at
                                 his watch-chain; he lifted her to his knee, and
                                 friendship was established.  They were at peace a
                                 moment later when a voice was heard in the hall,
                                 and the curtains were swung back as Eugenia
                                 Webb entered, tall and glowing, her head rising from
                                 a collar of fur.  She brought with her the breath of
                                 frost, and the winter red was in her cheeks, fading
                                 slowly as she sat down and threw off her wraps.
                                 He saw then that she looked older than he thought
                                 and that her elastic figure had settled into matronly lines.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8492">She raised her spotted veil and drew off her
                                 gloves.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8495">“I mustn't talk myself out,” she was saying
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8497"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="341" data-tei-n="352"> </a></span>
                                 lightly, “because Dudley means to make me bring
                                 him to call this evening.  I can't induce him to come
                                 by himself—he simply won't.  He considers my
                                 mission in life to be the combined duties of paying
                                 his calls and entertaining his legislators.  We had six
                                 senators to dinner last night, and we pay six visits
                                 this evening.  Come here, Tweedle-dee,” to the
                                 baby.  “Come to your own Aunt Eugie and give her
                                 a kiss.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8500">The child looked at her thoughtfully and shook
                                 her head.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8503">“Kith man,” she responded shortly.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8506">The swift red rose to Eugenia's face.  Nicholas
                                 was looking at her, and her eyes flashed with the
                                 old anger at a senseless blush.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8509">“That's right, old lady,” said the governor to the
                                 child.  “Tell her you'd rather kiss a man every time.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8513">“Of course she had,” replied Eugenia half
                                 angrily.  “She's going to be her mother all over
                                 again.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8516">Juliet laughed her full, soft laugh.  “Now, Eugie,”
                                 she protested gaily, “my sins are many, but spare
                                 me a public confession of them.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8519">“She takes after her aunt,” put in Sally frankly.
                                 “I always liked men better, and I think it's
                                 un-womanly not to—don't you, governor?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8522">Nicholas put the child down and rose.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8525">“I'm afraid my womanliness is only skin deep,”
                                 he returned, “but I wouldn't give one honest man
                                 for all the women since Eve.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8528">“Behold our far-famed gallantry!” exclaimed
                                 Sally.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e8534">Eugenia looked up, laughing.  She had seized upon
                                 the child, and he saw her dark eyes above the
                                 solemn blue ones.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8537">“I'm afraid you aren't much of a politician,
                                 Governor Burr, if you tell the truth so roundly,” she
                                 said.  “The first lesson in politics is to lie and love it;
                                 the second lesson is to lie and live it.  Oh, we've
                                 been in Congress, Dudley and I.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8540">She moved restlessly, and her colour came and
                                 went like a flame that flickers and revives.  He
                                 wondered vaguely at her nervous animation—she
                                 had not possessed a nerve in her girlhood—nor had
                                 he seen this shifting restlessness the other night.  It
                                 did not occur to him that the meeting with himself
                                 was the cause—he knew her too well—but had his
                                 presence, or some greater thing, aroused within her
                                 painful memories of the past?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8543">As he walked down Franklin Street a little later
                                 he contrasted boldly the two Eugenias he had
                                 known—the Eugenia who was his and the Eugenia
                                 who was Dudley Webb's.  After fifteen years the
                                 rapture and the agony of his youth showed
                                 grotesque to his later vision; men did not love like
                                 that at forty years.  He could see Eugenia now
                                 without the quiver of a pulse; he could sit across
                                 from her, knowing that she was the wife of another,
                                 and could eat his dinner.  His passion was dead, but
                                 where it had bloomed something else drew life and
                                 helped him to live.  He had loved one woman and he
                                 loved her still, though with a love which in his youth
                                 he would have held to be as ashes beside his flame.
                                 There were months even years—when he did not
                                 think of her; when he thought profoundly
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8545"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="343" data-tei-n="354"> </a></span>
                                 of other things; but in these years the thrill of no
                                 woman's skirts had disturbed his calm.  And again, there
                                 were winter evenings—evenings when he sat beside the
                                 hearth, and there came to him the thought of a home and
                                 children—of a woman's presence and a child's laugh.  He
                                 could have loved the woman well had she been Eugenia,
                                 and he could have loved the child had it been hers; but
                                 beyond her went neither his vision nor his desire.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8548">Now he swung on, large, forceful, a man young
                                 enough to feel, yet old enough to know.  He entered his
                                 door quickly, as was his custom, impatient for his work
                                 and his fireside.  On his desk lay the papers that had been
                                 brought over by his secretary, and he ran his fingers
                                 carelessly through them, gleaning indifferently the drift
                                 of their contents.  As he did so a light flashed suddenly
                                 upon him, and the meaning of Eugenia's restlessness was
                                 made clear, for upon his desk was an application for the
                                 pardon of Bernard Battle.

                              <p id="d44710e8559">The paper was still in his hand when the door behind
                                 him opened.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8562">“A lady to see you, suh.”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8565">“A lady?”  He turned impatiently to find himself
                                 facing Eugenia Webb.  She had come so swiftly, with a
                                 silence so apparitional, that he fell back as from a blow
                                 between the eyes.  For a moment he doubted her reality,
                                 and then the glow in her face, the mist on her furs, the
                                 fog of her breath, proclaimed that she had followed
                                 closely upon his footsteps.  She must have been almost
                                 beside him when he hurried through the frost.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8568">“You wish to speak to me?” he asked blankly, as he
                                 drew a chair to the hearth rug.  “Will you not sit down?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8572">There was an unfriendly question in his eyes, and she
                                 met it boldly with the old dash of impulse.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8575">“They told me that to-morrow would be too late,” she
                                 said.  “I went to Ben Galt's to ask him to come to you in
                                 my place, but he is out of town.  I found you there
                                 instead.  It is a matter of life and death to me, so I came.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8578">She sat down in the chair he had drawn up for her,
                                 her muff fell to the floor, and he placed it upon the desk
                                 where the petition lay unrolled.  As he did so he saw the
                                 list of names that presented the appeal—judge, jury,
                                 prosecuting attorney, all were there.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8581">She followed his gaze and moved slightly towards
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8583"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="345" data-tei-n="356"> </a></span>
                                 him.  “It can't be true that you—that you will
                                 not  -” she said.
                              </p>

                                 broke off he turned squarely upon her.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8589">“I have not looked into the case,” he answered harshly.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8593">He was standing beside his own hearthstone and
                                 he was at ease.  There was no awkwardness about
                                 him now; his height endowed him with majesty, and
                                 in his inflexible face there was no suggestion of
                                 heaviness.  He looked a man with a sublime
                                 self-confidence.

                              <p id="d44710e8596">Her colour beat quickly back, warming her eyes.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8599">“Oh, I am so glad,” she said.  “When you know
                                 all you will do as we ask you, because it is right and
                                 just.  If he did not serve that two years' sentence he
                                 has served six years of poverty and sickness.  He is
                                 a wreck—we should not know him, they say—and
                                 he has not seen his wife and children for  -”

                              <p id="d44710e8602">He raised his hand and stopped her.  A rising
                                 anger clouded his face, and, as she met his eyes,
                                 she slowly whitened.
                              </p>

                                 mercy to Bernard Battle?  Was there not a governor
                                 of Virginia before me?”

                                 heard from him  -”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8615">“So my predecessor refused?” he asked.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8618">She bowed her head.  “But it is so different now
                                 —every one is with us.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8621">He was looking her over grimly in an anger that

                                 seemed an emotional reversion to the past—as he
                                 felt himself reverting with all his strength to the
                                 original savage of the race.  The hour for which he
                                 had starved sixteen years ago was unfolding for him
                                 at last.  He gloated over it with a passion that would
                                 sicken him when it was done.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8626">“When you came to me,” he said slowly, “did

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8629">She had risen and was standing before him, her
                                 hands hidden in the fur upon her bosom.  She was
                                 pleading now with startled eyes and cold lips—she
                                 who had turned from him when the first lie was
                                 spoken—she was pleading for the man who had
                                 blackened his friend's honour that he might shield his
                                 own—she was pleading though she knew his
                                 baseness.  The very nobility of her posture—the
                                 nobility that he had found outwardly in no other
                                 woman—hardened the man before her.  The cold
                                 brow, the fervent mouth, the fearless eyes, the lines
                                 with which Time had chastened into womanliness
                                 her girlish figure—these had become the expression
                                 of an invincible regret.  As he faced her the iron of
                                 his nature held him as in a vise, for life, which had
                                 made him a just man, had not made him a gentle one.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8633">But her spirit had risen to match with his.  “He
                                 wronged you once,” she said; “let it pass—we have
                                 all been young and very ignorant; but we do not
                                 make our lives, thank God.”

                              <p id="d44710e8636">He looked at her in silence.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8639">Then, as he stood there, the walls of the room
                                 passed from before his eyes, and the gray light
                                 from the western window was falling upon the
                                 white road beyond the cedars.  The vague pasture swept to the

                                 far-off horizon where hung the solitary star above
                                 the sunset.  From the west a light wind blew, and
                                 into their faces dead leaves whirled from denuded
                                 trees far distant.  But surest of all was this—he
                                 hated now as he hated then.  “As for him—may
                                 God, in His mercy, damn him,” he had said.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8644">“Because he wronged you do not wrong
                                 yourself,” she spoke fearlessly, but she fell back
                                 with an upward movement of her hands.  The man
                                 was before her as the memory had been for
                                 years—she knew the distorted features, the
                                 convulsed, closed mouth, the furrow that cleft the
                                 forehead like a scar.  She saw the savage as she
                                 had seen it once before, and she braved it now as
                                 she had braved it then.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8647">“You are hard—as hard as life,” she said.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8650">“Life is as we make it,” he retorted.  He lifted her
                                 muff from the desk and she took it from him, turning
                                 towards the door.  As he followed her into the hall
                                 he spoke slowly: “I shall read the papers that relate
                                 to the case,” he said.  “I shall do my duty.  You were
                                 mistaken if you supposed that your coming to me
                                 would influence my decision.  Personal appeal rarely
                                 avails and is often painful.”

                              <p id="d44710e8654">He unlatched the outer door and she passed out
                                 and descended the steps.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8657">When he returned to the fire he was shivering
                                 from the draught let in by the opening doors, and,
                                 lifting the fallen poker, he attacked almost fiercely
                                 the slumbering coals.  The physical shock had not
                                 tempered the rage within; he felt it gnawing upon
                                 his entrails like a beast of prey.  Once only in his life
                                 had he found himself so powerless before a
                                 devouring passion, and then, as now, he had glutted

                                 it with wounded love.  Then, as now, he had hated
                                 with a terrible desire.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8662">The application lay upon his desk, and he pushed
                                 it out of sight.  He could not read it now—he
                                 wondered if the time would ever come when he
                                 could read it.  The thought smote him with the lash
                                 of fear—the fear of himself.  He who an hour ago
                                 had held his assurance to be beyond assault was
                                 now watching for the death of his hate as he might
                                 have watched for the death of a wolf whose fangs
                                 he had felt.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8665">Lifting his head, he could see through the
                                 curtained window the chill slopes of the square and
                                 the circular drive beneath the great bronze
                                 Washington.  Beyond the distant gates rose the
                                 church spires of the city, suffused with the pink
                                 flush of sunset.  The atmosphere glowed like a blush
                                 upon the perspective, which was shading through
                                 variations of violet remoteness.  All was frozen save
                                 the winter sunset and the advancing twilight.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8668">He turned from the window and faced the
                                 painting of the Confederate soldier.  For a moment
                                 he regarded it blankly, then, pushing aside Eugenia's
                                 chair he threw himself into one across from it.  He
                                 was thinking of Bernard Battle, and he remembered
                                 suddenly that he must have hated him always—that
                                 he had hated him long ago in his childhood when the
                                 weak-faced boy had headed a school faction
                                 against him.  True, Dudley Webb had incited the
                                 attempt at social ostracism, but he bore no
                                 resentment against Dudley—on the contrary, he
                                 was convinced that he liked him in spite of all—in
                                 spite, even, of Eugenia.  With the
                                 inflexible fairness that he never lost, he
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8670"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="349" data-tei-n="360"> </a></span>
                                 knew that, with Eugenia, Dudley had not wronged
                                 him.  It had been a fight in open field, and Dudley
                                 had won.  He had even liked the vigour of his
                                 wooing, and some years later, when they had met,
                                 he had given the victor a hearty handshake.  He
                                 distrusted him as a politician, but he liked him as a
                                 man.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8673">And Bernard Battle.  That was an honest hate,
                                 and he hugged it to him.  Before him still, so vivid
                                 that it seemed but yesterday, hovered the memory
                                 of that wild evening in the road, and the unforgotten
                                 sunset faced him as he hurried through the wood.  In
                                 the acuteness of his remembered senses he could
                                 hear the dead leaves rustle in his pathway and could
                                 smell the vague scents of autumn drifting on the
                                 wind.  Through all the years of public life and
                                 passionate endeavour he had not lost one colour of
                                 the painted clouds or missed one note from the
                                 sharp tangle of autumn odours.  To this day the
                                 going down of the sun in red and gold awoke within
                                 him the impulse of revenge, and the effluvium of
                                 rotting flowers or the tang of pines revived the
                                 duller ache of his senseless rage.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8677">On that evening he had buried his youth with his
                                 youthful passion.  The hours between the twilight
                                 and the dawn had seen his emotions consumed and
                                 his softer side laid waste.  Since then he had not
                                 played saint or martyr; he had gone his way among
                                 women, and he had liked some good ones and some
                                 bad ones—but the turn of Eugenia's head or the
                                 trick of her voice had haunted him in one and all.
                                 He had followed the resemblance and had found
                                 the vacancy; he had been from first to last a man of
                                 one ideal.  His nature had broadened, hardened, rung
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8679"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="350" data-tei-n="361"> </a></span>
                                 metallic to the senses; but it had not yielded to the
                                 shock of fresh emotions.  He had loved one woman
                                 from her childhood up.

                              <p id="d44710e8682">And again she rose before him as in that Indian
                                 summer when he knew her best—her beauty
                                 flaming against the autumn landscape, “clear as the
                                 sun, and terrible as an army with banners.”  He saw
                                 her red or pale, quivering or cold, always passing
                                 from him in a splendour of colours that was like the
                                 clash of music.

                              <p id="d44710e8685">That was sixteen years ago and it seemed but
                                 yesterday.  He had lost her, and yet he had not been
                                 unhappy, for he had learned that it is not gain that
                                 makes happiness nor loss that kills it.  Life had long
                                 since taught him the lesson all great men
                                 learn—that happiness is but one result of the
                                 adjustment of the individual needs to the Eternal
                                 Laws.  A man had once said of him, “Burr must
                                 think a lot of life; he bears it so blamed well.  He's
                                 the happiest man I know,” and Burr, overhearing
                                 him, had laughed aloud:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8688">“Am I?  I have never thought about it.”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8691">He did not think about life, he lived it; this was
                                 the beginning and the end of his success.

                              <p id="d44710e8694">The face of Eugenia faded slowly into the
                                 firelight, and he rose and shook himself like a man
                                 who awakes from a nightmare.  There was work
                                 for him at his desk, and he settled to it with sudden
                                 determination.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8698">A week later the papers were still in his desk.  He
                                 told himself at first that he would send them to
                                 Kingsborough to Judge Bassett and abide by his
                                 decision; but the course struck him as cowardly and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8700"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="351" data-tei-n="362"> </a></span>
                                 he put it from him.  The work was his and he would
                                 do it.  Then for a week longer he went on his way
                                 and did not think of them.  His days were filled with
                                 work and it was easy to leave disturbing thoughts
                                 alone; what was not easy was to consider them
                                 judicially.

                              <p id="d44710e8703">At last Galt spoke of the matter, and he could not
                                 refuse to listen.

                                 higher.  He's ill, I believe, and if he insists on
                                 returning to the State, as they say he will, the law
                                 can't help but arrest him.  It's a sad case.  So far as I
                                 can see he was a catspaw for the real criminal and
                                 didn't have sense enough to hold on to a share of
                                 the money after he sold himself.  His sister has been
                                 to see you, hasn't she?  She's a superb woman, and
                                 it was a good day for Dudley Webb when he
                                 married her.”

                              <p id="d44710e8719">He looked up inquiringly.</p>

                              <p id="d44710e8725">That night he locked himself in with the papers
                                 and plunged into the case.  He read and reread each
                                 written word until he was in possession of the
                                 minutest detail.  In another instance he knew that
                                 the reasons for granting the pardon would have
                                 seemed sufficient, and he would probably have had it made

                                 out at once.  As it was, he admitted the force of the
                                 appeal, but something stronger than himself held
                                 him back.  Above the name before him he saw the
                                 girlish face of the man he hated—saw it accusing,
                                 defying, beseeching—and beyond it he saw the
                                 gray road and the solitary star above the sunset.  In
                                 the silence his own voice echoed, “As for
                                 him—may God, in His mercy, damn him.”

                              <p id="d44710e8730">He locked the papers away again.  “I cannot do
                                 it,” he said.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8733">Several days later he sent for a member of the
                                 legislature from the town where the crime was
                                 committed.  He questioned him closely, but without
                                 result—the people up there were tired of it, the man
                                 said—at first they had been wrought up, but six
                                 years is a long time, and they didn't care much
                                 about it now.  As the governor closed the interview
                                 he realised that he had hoped a bitter hope that his
                                 revenge might be justified.  When the door had shut,
                                 he went back to the case again, and again he left it.
                                 “It ought to be done, but, God help me, I cannot do
                                 it,” he said.

                              <p id="d44710e8736">The next morning, while he was at work in his
                                 office in the Capitol, his secretary came in to tell
                                 him that Miss Christina Battle was in the anteroom.
                                 He rose hurriedly.  “I will see her at once,” he said,
                                 and he opened the door as Miss Chris came in,
                                 panting softly from her ascent in the elevator.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8740">She had changed so little that he took her hand in
                                 sudden timidity, recalling the days when he had sold
                                 her chickens before her hen-house door.  But when
                                 he had settled her in one of the cane rocking
                                 chairs beside the stove, his confidence returned and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8742"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="353" data-tei-n="364"> </a></span>
                                 he responded heartily to her beneficent beam.  Her
                                 florid face, shining large and luminous above the
                                 stiff black strings of her bonnet, reminded him of
                                 illustrations he had seen in which the sun is
                                 endowed with human features and an enveloping
                                 smile.

                              <p id="d44710e8745">“This is the greatest honour my office has
                                 brought me,” he said with sincerity.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8748">She laughed softly, smoothing her black kid glove
                                 above her plump wrist.
                              </p>

                                 aren't a lady's man, Governor Burr,” she returned.
                                 “I am sure old Judge Blitherstone himself never
                                 turned a prettier compliment, and he lived to be
                                 upwards of ninety and did them better every day of
                                 his life.  They used to say that when Mrs. Peachy
                                 Tucker dropped in to see him as he was breathing
                                 his last, and told him to look forward to the joys of
                                 heaven and the communion of saints, he replied,
                                 'Madam, if you remain with me I shall merely pass
                                 from one heaven to another,' and they were his last
                                 words.”

                              <p id="d44710e8754">The governor smiled into her beautiful, girlish
                                 eyes.  “Men have spoken worse ones,” he said, her
                                 kindliness warming him like a cordial.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e8761">“Not a bit of it,” protested Miss Chris with
                                 emphasis.  “It's all about that poor, foolish boy—he's
                                 still a boy to me, and so are you for that matter.
                                 You know how wicked he has been and how
                                 miserable he has made us all, for you can't stop
                                 loving people just because they are bad.  Now you
                                 are a good man, Governor Burr, and that's why I
                                 came to you.  You'll do right if it kills you, and whatever
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8763"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="354" data-tei-n="365"> </a></span>
                                 you do in this matter is going to be the right thing.
                                 You can't help being good any more than he can
                                 help being bad, and I hope the Lord understands this
                                 as well as I do—I don't know, I'm sure—sometimes
                                 it looks as if He didn't; but we'd just as well trust
                                 Him, because there's nothing else for us to do.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8766">“Now the foolish boy wronged you more than he
                                 wronged us; but you'll forgive him as we forgave
                                 him, when you know what he's suffered.  It's better
                                 to be sinned against than to sin, God knows.”

                              <p id="d44710e8769">Her eyes were moist and her lips trembled.  The
                                 governor crossed to where she sat and took her hand.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8772">“Dear Miss Chris,” he said, “women like you
                                 make men heroes.”  And he added quickly, “The
                                 pardon is being made out.  When it is ready I will
                                 sign it.”

                              <p id="d44710e8775">She looked at him an instant in silence; then she
                                 rose heavily to her feet, leaning upon his arm. “You're
                                 a great man, Nick Burr,” she said softly.
                              </p>

                                 upon his signature that meant freedom for Bernard
                                 Battle.  He had won the victory of his life, and he
                                 was feeling with a glow of self-appreciation that he
                                 had done a generous thing.

                              <p id="d44710e8789">Miss Chris, in her hired carriage, rolled leisurely
                                 into Franklin Street, where pretty women in visiting
                                 gowns were going in and out of doorways.  She
                                 leaned out and bowed smilingly several times, but
                                 she was not thinking of the gracefully dressed
                                 callers or of the houses into which they went.  When
                                 Emma Carr threw her a kiss from Galt's porch, she
                                 responded amiably; but she was as blind to the
                                 affectionate gesture as to the striking beauty of the
                                 girl in her winter furs.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8792">Up the quiet street the leafless trees made a gray
                                 vista that melted into transparent mist.  The sunshine
                                 stretched in pale gold bars from sidewalk to
                                 sidewalk, and overhead the sky was of a rare Italian
                                 blue.  But for the frost in the air and the naked
                                 boughs, it might have been a day in April.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8795">Presently the carriage turned into Main Street,
                                 halting abruptly while a trolley car shot past.
                                 “Please be very careful,” called Miss Chris
                                 nervously, gathering herself together as they
                                 stopped before a big gray house that faced a gray
                                 church on the opposite corner.  A flight of stone
                                 steps ran from the doorway to a short tesselated
                                 entrance leading to the street, where two scraggy
                                 poplars still held aloft the withered skeletons of last
                                 year's tulips.  The Webbs had taken the house
                                 because the box bushes in the yard reminded Eugenia of Battle

                                 driver, descending from his perch, and at the same
                                 instant the door of the house flew open and Eugenia
                                 ran out, bareheaded, followed by Dudley.

                                 I am positive that you've stolen a march on me and
                                 have been to market.  What a pity I confessed to

                                 “Take my arm, Aunt Chris, and I'll hoist you into the
                                 house before you know it.”

                                 stepping forth.  “I don't know when I've had such a
                                 turn.  These street car drivers have lost all their
                                 manners.  If we hadn't pulled up in time, I believe he
                                 would have gone right into us.  And to think that a
                                 few years ago we never got ready to go to market
                                 until the car was at the door.  Betty Taylor used to
                                 call to the driver every morning to wait till she put
                                 on her bonnet—and time and again I've seen him
                                 stop because she had forgotten her list of groceries.
                                 Now, if you weren't standing right on the corner, I
                                 actually believe they'd go by without you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8813">“That's progress, Aunt Chris,” responded Dudley
                                 cheerfully.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8816">Here the driver insisted upon lending a hand, and

                                 between them they established Miss Chris before
                                 the fire in the sitting-room.  “I wish you'd make
                                 Giles go out and pick up that loose paper that's
                                 scattered on the pavement,” she said to Eugenia.  “It
                                 looks so untidy.  If I wasn't rheumatic I'd do it
                                 myself.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8821">Dudley and Eugenia seated themselves across
                                 from her.  “Now where have you been, Aunt Chris?”
                                 they demanded.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8825">Miss Chris laughed softly as she took off her
                                 bonnet and gloves and gave them to Eugenia; then
                                 she unfastened her cape and passed it over.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8828">“You'll never find out that, my dears,” she
                                 returned.  “I'm not too old to keep a secret.  Why,
                                 I've gone and lost my bag.  Didn't I carry that bag
                                 with me, Eugenia?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8831">“Of course you did,” said Eugenia.  “Never mind,
                                 I'll make you another.”  She went out to put away
                                 Miss Chris's wraps, and came back presently,
                                 laughing.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8834">“Have you found out her secret, Dudley?” she
                                 asked.  “If she doesn't tell you, it will die with her.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8837">“I know better than to ask,” returned Dudley
                                 good-humouredly.  “That's the reason I'm her
                                 favourite.  I don't ask impertinent questions, do I,
                                 Aunt Chris?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8840">“Bless you, no,” responded Miss Chris serenely,
                                 as she stretched out her feet in their cloth shoes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8844">“You're her favourite because you happen to be
                                 a man,” protested Eugenia.  “She comes of a
                                 generation of man spoilers.  I believe she thinks I
                                 ought to bring you your slippers in the evening—
                                 now don't you, Aunt Chris?”
                              </p>

                                 father,” replied Miss Chris placidly.  “It was her
                                 pleasure to wait on him.”
                              </p>

                                 you do make an unfair difference between us, Aunt
                                 Chris.  Why did you call me 'uncharitable' when I
                                 said Mrs. Gordon painted immodestly!  Dudley said
                                 the same thing this morning, and you only smiled.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8855">“It was uncharitable, my dear, and besides it is
                                 too palpable to need mention—but men will be
                                 men.”

                              <p id="d44710e8858">Eugenia frowned.  “I wish you would
                                 occasionally remember that women will be women,”
                                 she suggested.  She wore a scarlet shirtwaist, and
                                 the glow from the fire seemed to follow her about.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8862">“I won't have Aunt Chris bullied, Eugie,”
                                 declared Dudley as he rose.  “Well, I'm off again.  I
                                 may bring a legislator or two back to dinner.  What
                                 have we got?”

                              <p id="d44710e8865">“The Lord knows,” replied Eugenia desperately.
                                 “Our third cook this month for one thing, and Congo
                                 refuses to serve dinner in courses.  He says 'dar's

                              <p id="d44710e8868">Dudley laughed at her mimicry.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8871">“Oh, I suppose we'll do,” he said.  “By the way,
                                 don't forget to call on Mrs. Rann to-day.”

                                 looked up.

                              <p id="d44710e8889">“So that s where you've been!” cried Eugenia.
                                 She threw herself beside Miss Chris's chair.  “What
                                 did he say, Aunt Chris?” she implored.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8892">Miss Chris blushed with confusion.</p>

                                 age.”  Then she patted Eugenia's hand.  “He's a
                                 good man,” she said softly, “and it's all right about
                                 Bernard.”

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8902">But Eugenia had turned away with swimming
                                 eyes.  “I must tell Lottie,” she said hurriedly.  “Oh,

                                 cheerfully, and Eugenia smiled at him through her
                                 tears.

                                 slowly ascended the stairs.  On the landing above
                                 she entered a room where Bernard's wife was lying
                                 on a wicker couch, cutting the pages of a magazine.

                                 herself on her elbow.  She had a pretty, ineffectual

                                 colouring, looked almost helplessly young.  Her

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8926">“Can't you guess what it is?” she asked.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8929">Lottie looked up with a nervous blinking of her
                                 eyes.  She had paled slightly and she leaned over
                                 and drew an eiderdown quilt across her knees.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8932">“It—it's not about Bernard?” she asked in a
                                 whisper.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8935">“Yes, it is about Bernard.  You may go to him
                                 and bring him home.  You may go to-morrow.  Oh,
                                 Lottie, doesn't it make you happy?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8939">Lottie drew the eiderdown quilt still higher.  She
                                 was not looking at Eugenia, and her mouth had
                                 grown sullen.  “I don't see why you send me,” she
                                 said.  “Why can't Jack Tucker bring him home?
                                 He's with him.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8942">“But I thought you wanted to go,” returned
                                 Eugenia blankly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8945">“I haven't seen him for six years,” said Lottie, her
                                 face still turned away.  “He is almost a
                                 stranger—and I am afraid of him.''
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8948">“Oh, Lottie, he loves you so!”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8951">“I don't know,” protested Lottie.  “He has been
                                 so wicked.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8954">Eugenia was looking down upon her with
                                 dismayed eyes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8958">“Don't you love him, Lottie?” she asked.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8961">For a moment the other did not reply.  Her lips
                                 trembled and her knees were shaking beneath the
                                 eiderdown quilt.  Then with a slow turn of the head
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e8963"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="361" data-tei-n="372"> </a></span>
                                 she looked up doggedly.  “I believe I hate him,” she
                                 answered.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8966">A swift flush rose to Eugenia's face, her eyes
                                 flashed angrily, she took a step forward.  “And you
                                 are his wife!” she cried.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8969">But Lottie had turned at last.  She flung the quilt
                                 aside and rose to her feet, her girlish figure
                                 quivering in its beribboned wrapper.  There were
                                 bright pink spots in her cheeks.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8972">“Yes, I am his wife, God help me,” she said.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8975">Eugenia had drawn back before the childish
                                 desperation.  Lottie had never revolted before—she
                                 had thought Eugenia's thoughts and weakly lived up
                                 to Eugenia's conception of her duty.  She had been
                                 meek and amiable and ineffectual; but it came to
                                 Eugenia with a shock that she had never admired
                                 her until to-day—until the hour of her rebellion.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8979">She spoke sternly—as she might have spoken to
                                 herself in a moment of dear, but dismal failure.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8982">“Hush,” she commanded.  “You are one of us,
                                 and you have no right to desert us.  It is because you
                                 are his wife that my home is yours and your
                                 children's.  I am only his sister, and I have stood by
                                 him through it all.  Do you think, if his sins were
                                 twenty times as great, that I should fall away from
                                 him now?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8985">Lottie looked at her and laughed—a little
                                 heartless laugh.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8988">“Oh, but I am not a Battle,” she replied bitterly.
                                 “Battle sins are just like other people's sins to me.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e8991">Then she raised her pretty, nerveless hands to
                                 her throat.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e8997">“I have wanted to be free all these years,” she
                                 said.  “All these years when you would not let me
                                 forget Bernard Battle—when you shut me up and
                                 hid me away, and made me old when I was young.
                                 And now—just as I am beginning to be happy with
                                 my children—you tell me that I must go back to him
                                 and start afresh.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9000">Her voice grated upon Eugenia's ears, and she
                                 realised more acutely than her pity the fact that
                                 Lottie was common—hopelessly common.  For an
                                 instant she forgot Bernard's greater transgressions
                                 in the wonder that a Battle should have married a
                                 woman who did not know how to behave in a
                                 crisis—who could even chant her wrongs from the
                                 housetop.  At the moment this seemed to her the
                                 weightier share of the family remissness.  The
                                 loyalty of the Battle wives had been as a lasting
                                 memorial to the Battle breeding—which, after all,
                                 was more invincible than the Battle virtue.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9003">She crossed to the window and stood looking out
                                 upon the winter sunshine falling on the gray church
                                 across the way.  On the stone steps a negro nurse
                                 was sitting, drowsily trundling back and forth before
                                 her a beruffled baby carriage.  Nearer at hand, in
                                 the yard on the left of the tesselated entrance
                                 below, a pointed magnolia tree shone evergreen
                                 beside the naked poplars, and a bevy of sparrows
                                 fluttered in and out amid the sheltering leaves.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9006">“Oh, you will never understand,” wailed Lottie.
                                 She had flung herself upon the couch and was
                                 sobbing weakly.  “It is so different with you and
                                 Dudley.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9009">Eugenia turned and came back.  “I do understand,”
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9011"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="363" data-tei-n="374"> </a></span>
                                 she resumed gently, and before Lottie could
                                 raise her head she left the room.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9014">She had promised Dudley that the calls should be
                                 made, and she put on her visiting gown without a
                                 thought of shirking the fulfilment of her pledge.
                                 From the day of her marriage she had zealously
                                 accepted the obligations forced upon her by
                                 Dudley's political aspirations, and Mrs. Rann
                                 became today simply a heavier responsibility than
                                 usual.  Her world was full of Mrs. Ranns, and she
                                 braved them with dauntless spirits and triumphant
                                 humour.  As she buttoned her gloves on the way
                                 downstairs she was conscious of a singularly mild
                                 recognition of the fact that the world might have
                                 been the gainer had Mrs. Rann abided unborn.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9018">But the fresh air restored her courage, and by the
                                 time she sat in Mrs. Rann's drawing-room, face to
                                 face with her hostess, she was at ease with herself
                                 and her surroundings.  She gave out at once the
                                 peculiar social atmosphere of her race; she uttered
                                 her gay little nothings with an intimate air; she
                                 laughed good-humouredly at Mrs. Rann's gossip,
                                 and she begged to see photographs of Mrs. Rann's
                                 babies.  It was as if she had immediately become
                                 the confidential adviser of Mrs. Rann's domestic
                                 difficulties.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9021">Mrs. Rann, herself, was little and plain and
                                 obsolete.  She appeared to have been left behind in
                                 the sixties, like words that have become vulgar
                                 from disuse.  She wore bracelets on her wrists, and
                                 her accent was as flat as her ideas.  Before the war
                                 —and even long after—nobody had heard of the
                                 Ranns; they had arrived as suddenly as the electric
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9023"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="364" data-tei-n="375"> </a></span>
                                 lights or the trolley cars.  When Miss Chris had
                                 alluded to them as “new people,” and Juliet Galt had
                                 declared that she “did not call there,” Dudley had
                                 thrown out an uncertain line to Eugenia.  “Rann is a
                                 useful man, my dear,” he had said.  “He may be of
                                 great help to me,” and the next day Eugenia had left
                                 her card.  Where Dudley's ambitions led she
                                 cheerfully followed.

                              <p id="d44710e9026">“We are politicians,” was her excuse to Juliet,
                                 “and we can't afford to be exclusive.  Of course, with
                                 Emma Carr and yourself it is different.  You may
                                 exclude half society if you please, and, in fact, you
                                 do; but Dudley and I really don't mind.  He wants
                                 something, and I, you know, was born without the
                                 instinct of class.”

                              <p id="d44710e9029">So she sat in Mrs. Rann's drawing-room and
                                 received her confidences, while Juliet and Emma
                                 Carr were gossiping across the street.

                                 when he comes to town,” said Mrs. Rann, “is that
                                 he refuses to wear woollen socks.  I don't know
                                 whether Mr. Webb wears woollen socks or not.”

                                 woollen socks don't look well in the evening—and
                                 he takes cold every time he goes out at night.  He
                                 won't even let me put red flannel in the soles of his shoes.”

                                 of her shallow eyes Eugenia read a triumphant
                                 compassion.  This little vulgar countrywoman, upon
                                 whom she looked so grandly down, was pitying her
                                 in her narrow heart.

                                 old,” she replied, and she hated herself that she was
                                 proud of her seven days' motherhood.  She had
                                 mourned the loss, but she had never vaunted the
                                 possession until now.

                                 “Come over, Eugie,” she cried.  “We've been
                                 watching you,” and as Eugenia ascended the steps
                                 the door was opened and she was clasped in Emma
                                 Carr's arms.  “We've shut our eyes and ground our
                                 teeth and put ourselves in your place,” she said.
                                 “Oh, Eugie, she's worse than the dentist!”

                                 and sank into the window-seat beside Juliet, who
                                 was bending over her embroidery frame.  Then she
                                 laughed—a full, frank laugh.

                                 smiled at each other in demonstrative intimacy.
                                 “You know, of course, that we are all in love with
                                 your husband—desperately, darkly in love—and you
                                 ought to be gray with jealousy.  If I were married to
                                 the handsomest man in Virginia I'd get me to a nunnery.”

                                 her silk.  “If she went, she'd drag him after.”

                                 opened Lottie's door and glanced into the room.  By
                                 the sinking firelight she saw Lottie lying asleep, her
                                 hand upon the pillow of her younger child, who slept
                                 beside her.  The pretty, nerveless hand, even in
                                 sleep, tremored like a caress, for whatever Lottie's
                                 wifely failings, as a mother she was without
                                 reproach.  Lottie—vain, hysterical, bewailing her
                                 wrongs—was the same Lottie now resting with a
                                 protecting arm thrown out—this Eugenia admitted
                                 thoughtfully as she looked into the darkened room
                                 where the thin blue flame cast a spectral light upon
                                 the sleepers.  From this shallow rooted nature had
                                 bloomed the maternal ardour of the Southern
                                 woman, in whom motherhood is the abiding grace.

                                 Miss Chris, who was reading her Bible as she
                                 seeded raisins into a small yellow bowl.  The leaves
                                 of the Bible were held open by her spectacle case
                                 which she had placed between them; for while her
                                 hands were busy with material matters her placid
                                 eyes followed the text.

                                 herself into a chair.  “I wonder why everybody
                                 spoils Dudley so,” she added.  “Even I do it.  I am
                                 sitting up for him to-night simply because I know
                                 he'll want to tell me about it all when he comes in.”

                                 returned Miss Chris, shaking the raisins together.
                                 “If my poor father stayed out until four o'clock in the

                                 affectionately.  “What a blessing that you didn't
                                 marry, Aunt Chris,” she said.  “You'd have prepared
                                 some man to merit damnation.”

                                 shocked, half flattered at the picture.  “But you're a
                                 good wife, all the same, like your mother before
                                 you.  The only fault I ever saw in poor Meely was
                                 that she wouldn't put currants in her fruit cake.  Tom
                                 was always fond of currants  -” in a moment she
                                 abruptly recalled herself.  “My dear, I don't say you
                                 haven't had your trials,” she went on.  “Dudley isn't
                                 a saint, but I don't believe even the Lord expects a
                                 man to be that.  It doesn't seem to set well on them.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9120">“Oh, I am not blaming Dudley,” returned Eugenie
                                 as leniently as Miss Chris.  “We live and let
                                 live—only our tastes are different.  Why, the chief
                                 proof of his affection for me is that he always
                                 describes to me the object of his admiration—which
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9122"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="369" data-tei-n="380"> </a></span>
                                 means that his eyes stray, but his heart does not,
                                 and the heart's the chief thing, after all.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9125">“I'm glad you aren't jealous,” said Miss Chris.
                                 “I used to think you were—as a child.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9128">“Oh, I was—as a child,” replied Eugenia.  Her
                                 kindly face clouded.  It was borne in upon her with a
                                 twinge of conscience that the absence of jealousy
                                 which had become the safeguard of Dudley's peace
                                 proved her own lack of passion.  What a hell some
                                 women—good women—might have made of
                                 Dudley's life—that genial life that flowed as
                                 smoothly as a song.  In the flights and pauses of his
                                 temperament what discord might have shocked the
                                 decent measure of their marriage?  Persistent passion
                                 would have bored him; exacting love would have
                                 soured the charm of his radiant egotism.  It was
                                 because she was not in love with him, that
                                 her love had wisely meted out to him only so much
                                 or so little of herself as he desired—and with a
                                 sudden arraignment of Fate she admitted that
                                 because she had failed in the first requirement of the
                                 marriage sacrament, she had made that sacrament
                                 other than a mockery.  Out of her own unfulfilment
                                 Dudley's happiness was fulfilled.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9132">“Yes, Dudley suits me,” she said absently, “and,
                                 what's the main thing, I suit Dudley.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9135">“Well, well, I'm glad of it,” returned Miss Chris,
                                 but in a moment Eugenia was kneeling beside her,
                                 her hand upon the open Bible.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9138">“Dear Aunt Chris, you haven't told me all,” she
                                 said.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9141">“All?” Miss Chris wavered.  “You mean
                                 about Bernard?”
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e9146">“I mean about the governor.”  She closed the
                                 Bible and pushed it from her.  “Do you think he is
                                 quite, quite happy?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9150">Miss Chris laughed in protest.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9153">“Do I believe him to be pining of hopeless love?
                                 No, I don't,” she retorted.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9156">“Oh, not that!” exclaimed Eugenia impatiently.
                                 She appeared vaguely to resent Miss Chris's
                                 assurance.  She was feminine enough to experience
                                 an irrational jealousy at the idea of a vacancy which
                                 she had done her best to create.  It destroyed an
                                 example of the permanence of love.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9159">“I don't suppose anybody could be happy on
                                 politics,” observed Miss Chris.  “It doesn't seem
                                 natural.”  And she slowly added: “I wish some good
                                 woman would marry him.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9162">“I don't!” said Eugenia sharply.  She rose with a
                                 spring from the rug, and left Miss Chris to her
                                 reflections and her raisins. In her own room she sat
                                 down before the fire and loosened her hair from the
                                 low coil on her neck.  She drew out the hairpins one
                                 by one, until her hands were full, and the thick black
                                 rope fell across her bosom.  Then she tossed the
                                 pins upon her bureau and shook a veil over her face
                                 and shoulders.  As she settled herself into her chair
                                 she glanced impatiently at the clock.  Dudley was
                                 late, and she listened for his footsteps with the
                                 composure of a woman from whom the flush of
                                 marriage has passed away.  His footsteps were as
                                 much a part of her days as the ticking of the clock
                                 upon the mantel.  If the clock were to stop she
                                 would miss the accustomed sound, but so long as it
                                 went on she was almost unconscious of its presence.
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9164"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="371" data-tei-n="382"> </a></span>
                                 Her affection for Dudley had grown so into her
                                 nature that it was like the claim of kinship—quiet,
                                 unimpassioned, full of service—the love that is the
                                 end of many happy marriages, the beginning of few.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9167">As she sat there she fell vaguely to wondering
                                 what her lot would have been had her pulses
                                 fluttered to his footsteps as they came and went.  She
                                 would have known remorseless wailings and the long
                                 agony of jealous nights—all the passionate self-torture
                                 that she had missed—that she had missed, thank
                                 God!  She made the best of her life to-day, as she would
                                 have made the best of blows and bruises.  It was
                                 the old buoyant instinct of the Battle blood—the
                                 fighting of Fate on its ground with its own weapons.
                                 She had insisted strenuously upon her own
                                 happiness—and she had found it not in the great
                                 things of life, but in the little ones.  She was happy
                                 because happiness is ours in the cradles or not at
                                 all—because it is of the blood and not of
                                 the environment.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9171">During the first years of her marriage she had
                                 intensely sought the relief of outside interests.  She
                                 had worked zealously on hospital boards and had
                                 exhausted herself in the service of the city mission.
                                 Then a new call had quivered in her life, and she
                                 had let these things go.  With the passion of her
                                 nature she had pledged herself to motherhood, and
                                 that, too, had foiled her—for the child had died.
                                 Looking back upon the years she saw that those
                                 months of tranquil waiting were the happiest of her
                                 life—those monotonous months when each day was
                                 as the day before it, when her hands were busy for
                                 the love that
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9173"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="372" data-tei-n="383"> </a></span>
                                 would come to her, and her heart warmed itself
                                 before the future.  The child was hers for a single
                                 week, and afterwards she had put her grief away
                                 and gone back to the old beginning.  She had given
                                 herself to little kindnesses and trivial interests, for
                                 the fulfilment of her nature had withered in the bud.

                                 moment she heard Dudley in the hall.  As her door
                                 opened she looked up brightly.  “Up, old girl?” he
                                 asked cheerfully, and as he came to the fire he bent
                                 to kiss her.

                                 she inquired.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9182">“Oh, they got a good deal out of me,” he
                                 responded with a genial recollection which he
                                 proceeded to unfold.  His eyes shone and his face
                                 was flushed.  As he stood on the hearth rug before
                                 her she admitted with a sigh of satisfaction his
                                 physical splendour.  The glow of his personality
                                 warmed her into an emotion half maternal.  She
                                 regarded him with the eyes of tolerant affection.

                              <p id="d44710e9185">“Oh, yes, I think I made a friend of Diggs,” he
                                 was adding complacently as he flecked a particle of
                                 cigar ash from his coat.  “He got off a capital story,
                                 by the way.  I'd give it to you, but I'm half afraid
                                 —you're so squeamish.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9188">“His jokes don't amuse me,” returned Eugenia
                                 indifferently.  “Who else was there?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9192">“Well, the governor was very much there.  He
                                 did some stiff talking.  I say, Eugie, do you know, I
                                 believe he used to have a pretty strong fancy for
                                 you—didn't he?”
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e9197">Eugenia looked at him with a laugh. “Oh, a fancy?”
                                 she repeated.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9200">She moved away, gathering her hair from her
                                 shoulders; but in a moment she came back again
                                 and rubbed her cheek against Dudley's arm as she
                                 used to rub it against General Battle's old linen
                                 sleeve.  “Dudley,” she said with a sudden break,
                                 “the baby would have been ten years old to-night
                                 —do you remember?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9203">Dudley was looking into the fire; his face grew
                                 grave, and he patted Eugenia's head.  “You don't
                                 say so!  Poor little chap!” he exclaimed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9206">They were both silent.  Dudley's eyes were still on
                                 the flame, but the shadow lifted from his brow.
                                 Eugenia's lips quivered and grew firm.  She gently
                                 drew herself away and began braiding her hair, but
                                 her hands were unsteady.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9210">In a moment Dudley spoke again.  “It was a
                                 great pity I lost that governorship,” he said
                                 abstractedly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9213">A week after this Eugenia went with Juliet Galt
                                 to the Capitol to hear a speech in which Dudley was
                                 interested.  The Senate Chamber was crowded, and
                                 as the atmosphere grew oppressive while Dudley's
                                 gentleman held the floor, she rose and went out into
                                 the lobby where a noisy circle pulsed round
                                 Houdon's Washington.  She had spoken to several
                                 acquaintances, and her hand was in the clasp of a
                                 house member from her old county, when she
                                 started at the sound of a shrill voice rising above the
                                 persistent hum of the legislators and the lobbyists.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9216">“I'm a-lookin' for the governor, Nick Burr,”
                                 it said.
                              </p>

                                 cavalier,” laughed the house member, and as a
                                 wave of humour lighted the faces around her,
                                 Eugenia turned to find Marthy Burr standing in
                                 the doorway.  She wore a stiff alpaca dress, and
                                 beneath the green veil above her bonnet she cast
                                 alert, nervous glances from side to side.  Her hands
                                 clutched, in a deathlike grip, a Cotton umbrella and
                                 a small, covered basket.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9224">Eugenia hesitated for a single instant, and then
                                 took a step forward with outstretched hand, a kindly
                                 glow in her face; but as she did so the crowd parted
                                 and Nicholas Burr reached his stepmother's side.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9228">“Why, this is a treat, ma!” he said heartily, and
                                 he took the umbrella and the basket from her
                                 reluctant hands, despite her warning whisper,
                                 “thar's new-laid eggs in thar!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9231">“My dear Mrs. Burr!” exclaimed Eugenia.  She
                                 lifted her gaze from the homely figure in its
                                 awkward finery, to the man who stood beside her.
                                 Then she stooped and kissed Marthy Burr on the
                                 cheek.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9234">“Do let her come home with me,” she said.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9237">Her eyes fell and a wave of colour beat into her
                                 face.  An instant before she had felt her act to be
                                 entirely admirable; now it flamed before her in
                                 mental revelation that she was a sycophant who
                                 sought the reward of an assumed virtue.  With the
                                 reward had come the knowledge—she had found
                                 both in Nicholas's eyes; and as she felt the thrust of
                                 self-abasement, she felt also that for the sake of
                                 that look she would have kissed a dozen Burrs a
                                 dozen times.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e9242">“You are very kind,” said the governor.  “But you
                                 know I have an empty house.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9246">Then he put his arm about Marthy Burr and
                                 assisted her down the steps to the walk below.  She
                                 looked about her with half-frightened, half-defiant
                                 eyes, and clung grimly to his powerful figure.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9249">As Eugenia watched them, a quick remembrance
                                 shot before her.  She saw Nicholas Burr as she had
                                 seen him in his youth—ardent, assured, holding out
                                 his arms to the future, which was to be love, love,
                                 love.  Now the future had become the present, and
                                 the one affection that remained to him was that of
                                 the old, illiterate woman, with the rasping voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9252">He had lost the thing he had lived for—and he was
                                 happy.

                              <p id="d44710e9272">On one of the closing days of the legislative
                                 session, Ben Galt lounged into the anteroom of the
                                 governor's office and cornered the private
                                 secretary.  “Look here, Dickson, what's the latest
                                 demonstration of Old Nickism?  I hear he's giving
                                 Rann trouble about that bill of his.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9275">Dickson nodded significantly towards the closed
                                 door.  “Rann's with him now,” he replied; “they're
                                 having it hot in there.  Rann may bluster till he's blue,
                                 but he won't make the governor give an inch.  That
                                 bill's as dead as a door nail.  The governor's got a fit
                                 of duty on.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9278">“Or his everlasting obstinacy,” returned Galt
                                 irritably.  “His duty does more harm than most
                                 men's devilment—it stands like a stone wall between
                                 him and his ambition.  Of course, that bill is a
                                 political swindle, but there isn't another politician in
                                 the State who would interfere in Rann's little game.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9281">“Oh, between us, I think Rann's honest enough.
                                 He believes he's up to a good thing, but the
                                 governor disagrees with him—there's where the
                                 row begins.”

                              <p id="d44710e9290">“Say?” laughed Dickson.  “Why, I asked him if
                                 he would approve the measure and he said 'No!'
                                 That's the beginning and the end of his discourse
                                 —a 'No' long drawn out.”

                              <p id="d44710e9293">The door opened abruptly, and Rann put out his
                                 head.  “Will you step in here, Mr. Galt?” he asked,
                                 and his voice was husky with anger.  “With
                                 pleasure, my dear Major,” responded Galt easily, as
                                 he crossed the threshold and closed the door after
                                 him.  “I am always at your service as a
                                 peacemaker.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9296">The governor was standing before his desk, his
                                 eyes upon Rann, who faced him, red and trembling.
                                 Galt had seen Burr wear this impassive front before,
                                 and it had always meant trouble.  His eyes were
                                 opaque and leaden, his face as expressionless as a
                                 mask.  He was motionless save for the movement of
                                 one hand that drummed upon the desk.  “If you
                                 possess any influence with the governor,” said Rann
                                 to Galt, “will you tell him that his course is ruinous—ruinous to imbecility?  If
                                 he thinks I am going to
                                 throw away a winter's work on that bill he's
                                 mistaken his man.  It's taken me the whole session to
                                 get that measure through the legislature, and I'm not
                                 going to have it defeated now by any crack-brained
                                 moralist.  He'll sign that bill or  -”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9299">Burr spoke at last.  “Am I the governor of this
                                 State or are you?” he thundered.  His face did not
                                 change, but his powerful voice rang to the full.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9303">Rann gave an ugly little sneer, his cheek purpling.
                                 “I may not be governor, but I made you so,” he
                                 retorted.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9306">“Your mistake, my dear Major, was that you

                                 Galt coolly.

                                 of working for your pitiable majority.  Since you
                                 have seen fit to deride my motive, it is sufficient for
                                 me to say that the measure will not become a law
                                 over my opposition, and I shall oppose it to the
                                 death.”

                                 were trembling. “So you defy me, do you,
                                 Governor?” he demanded.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9317">“Defy you?” the governor laughed shortly,
                                 “I don't trouble to defy you.  I laugh at you—the whole
                                 lot of you who come to cozen me with party
                                 promises.  So long as I spoke your speech and did
                                 your bidding I might have the senatorship for the
                                 asking.  I was honest Nick Burr, though I might belie
                                 my convictions at every step.  So long as I wore the
                                 collar of your machine upon my neck my honesty
                                 was the hall-mark of the party.  Where is my
                                 honesty, the first instant that I dare to stand against
                                 you?  Defy you?  Pshaw!  You aren't worth defying!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9320">“Hold on!” said Galt hastily.  “Nick, for God's
                                 sake, leave our friend alone.  You're both good
                                 fellows—too good to quarrel  -”

                              <p id="d44710e9324">“Oh, there's no use,” protested Rann, wiping his
                                 flaming brow.  “I've offered a dozen compromises
                                 —but compromise I won't without that bill.  Bear
                                 witness that I've upheld him from the start.  I'd
                                 have run him for the presidency itself if I'd had the

                                 power, and when I ask a little friendly return he
                                 talks about his damned duty.  But I tell you, he's
                                 signed his own warrant.  He's as dead in this State
                                 as if his grave was dug.  He's held his last office in
                                 the Democratic Party.”

                                 responded the governor; then he looked vacantly
                                 before him.  “I have the pleasure to wish you good
                                 morning,” he said.

                              <p id="d44710e9332">When Rann had gone, and the door had slammed
                                 after him, Galt turned, with a laugh.

                              <p id="d44710e9335">“Shake!” he exclaimed, and as Nicholas grasped
                                 his hand, added lightly, “My dear friend, you may
                                 as well have a quiet conscience, since you'll never
                                 have the senatorship.”

                              <p id="d44710e9338">Nicholas drew his hand away impatiently.  “I'm
                                 not beaten yet,” he said.  “I'll fight and I'll win, or
                                 my name's not Burr!  Do you think I'm afraid of a
                                 sneak like that?  Why, he offered me the
                                 senatorship as coolly as if he had it in his pocket!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9341">Galt laughed.  “I'm not sure he hasn't; at any rate
                                 he's the power of the ring, and the ring's the power
                                 of the party.”

                              <p id="d44710e9345">“Then I'll fight the ring,” said Nicholas, “and, if
                                 need be, I'll fight the party.  So long as right and the
                                 people are with me the party may go hang.”

                                 Webb a good turn; Rann is going to fight you fair and
                                 foul—mostly foul.”

                              <p id="d44710e9354">“Or yet of the devil!” added Galt.  “When I

                                 wait a few days and Rann will have this little
                                 passage reported to his credit.  I'll get ahead of him
                                 with the story, or I'll find some cocked-up account
                                 of it circulating in the lobby.  It's easier to blacken
                                 the best man than to whiten the worst.  Well, I'm
                                 going.  Good day!”

                                 the window and stood looking down upon the gray
                                 drive beneath the leafless trees.  The sun was
                                 obscured by a sinister cloud that had blotted out all
                                 the fugitive brightness of the morning.  A fine
                                 moisture was in the air, and the atmosphere hung
                                 heavily down the naked slopes, where the grass
                                 was colourless and dead.  Beyond the gates, the city
                                 was lost in a blurred and melancholy distance, from
                                 which several indistinct church spires rose and sank
                                 in a sea of fog.

                                 was not exhilarated by sunshine nor was he
                                 depressed by gloom; only the inner forces of his
                                 nature had power to quicken or control his moods.
                                 His inspiration, like his destiny, lay within, and so
                                 long as he maintained his wonted equilibrium of
                                 judgment and desire it was, perhaps, impossible that
                                 an outside assault should severely shake the
                                 foundations of his life.

                              <p id="d44710e9366">Now, while the glow of his anger still lingered in
                                 his brain, it was characteristic of the man that he
                                 was feeling a pity for Rann's disappointment—for
                                 the discomfiture of one whose methods he despised.
                                 In Rann's place, he felt that he should probably have
                                 risen to the charge as Rann rose—implacable,
                                 unswerving; but he was not in Rann's place, nor
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9368"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="381" data-tei-n="394"> </a></span>
                                 could he be so long as personal reward was less to
                                 him than personal honour.  Yes, he could pity Rann
                                 even while he condemned him.  For an instant—a
                                 single instant—he had found himself shrinking from
                                 the combat, and in the shock of self-contempt which
                                 followed he had hurled the shock of his resentment
                                 upon the tempter.  In that moment of weakness it
                                 had seemed to him an easy thing to let one's self go;
                                 to yield to a friendly, if distrusted force; to place
                                 gratified ambition above the sting of wounded
                                 scruples.  Was he infallible that he should make his
                                 judgment a law, or without reproach that he should
                                 set his conscience as an arbiter?

                              <p id="d44710e9371">Then in a sudden illumination he had seen the
                                 betrayal of his sophistry, and he had stood his
                                 ground—for the strong man is not he who is
                                 impervious to weaknesses, but he who, scorning his
                                 failures, towers over them.  He had felt the
                                 temptation and he had wavered, but not for long.  In
                                 all his periods of storm and stress he had found that
                                 his nature rebounded in the end.  Disquietude might
                                 waste his ardour; but give him time to reorganise his
                                 forces, and his moral energy would triumph at the
                                 last.

                              <p id="d44710e9374">As he looked out upon the great bronze
                                 Washington against the sad-coloured sky, he
                                 realised, with a pang like the thrust of
                                 homesickness, the isolation in which he stood.  An
                                 instinctive need to justify himself had risen within
                                 him, and with it awoke the knowledge that beyond
                                 that uncertain abstraction which he called “the
                                 People,” he was an alien among his kind.  Galt was
                                 his friend, Tom Bassett he could count on, a score
                                 of others would stand or

                                 fall in his service, but where was the single emotion
                                 which bound him to humanity?  Where the common
                                 claim of kinship which belonged to Galt, to Bassett,
                                 and to all mankind?  He had known many men, but he
                                 knew not one who was not drawn by some
                                 connecting link that was apart from patriotism, or
                                 ambition, or desire.  Then quickly there came to him,
                                 not the judge, who was the parent of his intellect, but
                                 the withered little woman, who was not even the
                                 mother of his body.  The only happiness that rose and
                                 set in him was that pitiable happiness that could not
                                 think his thoughts or speak his speech.  It had never
                                 occurred to him that he loved Marthy Burr—his
                                 kindness had been wholly compassionate—it was the
                                 knowledge that she loved him that now illuminated
                                 her image.  It was the old blind craving born again, to
                                 be first with somebody—for there are moods in
                                 which it is better to be adored by a dog than to adore
                                 a divinity.  He beheld Eugenia's womanhood as “A
                                 sword afar off”; but with him was the eternal
                                 commonplace—his stepmother's sharp, pained eyes
                                 and shrivelled hands.  He had loved Eugenia until
                                 there was nothing left; now he wanted to be loved,
                                 if by a dog.

                                 recognised a figure.  He saw only men down there,
                                 and the thought came to him that his was a man's
                                 world—only in the outside circle might he catch the
                                 flutter of a woman's dress.  He turned and went
                                 back to his desk and his work.

                                 was surprised at the apparent indifference displayed
                                 by the curt announcement.  Did Rann's resentment
                                 hang fire?  Or was the press prepared to uphold the
                                 governor?

                                 came in to congratulate him upon his stand.  His
                                 name was Saunders, and he was a man of some
                                 ability, whom Nicholas had always regarded as a
                                 partisan of Webb.

                                 said emphatically, “and I'd given up all hope of
                                 defeating it when you had the pluck to knock it over.
                                 You've made enemies, Governor, but you've made
                                 friends, and I'm one of them.  Give me the man who
                                 dares!”  He held out his hand as he rose, and
                                 Nicholas responded with a hearty grip.  Before the
                                 legislature closed he found that Saunders spoke the
                                 truth—he had made friends as well as enemies.  The
                                 inborn Anglo-Saxon love of “the man who dares”
                                 was with him—a regard for daring for its own
                                 heroic sake.  The hour was his, and he braved his
                                 shifting popularity as he would brave its final outcome.

                              <p id="d44710e9402">One afternoon in early May, Dudley Webb came
                                 out upon his front steps and paused to light a cigar
                                 before descending to the street.  A spring of happy
                                 promise was unfolding, for overhead the poplars
                                 bloomed against an enchanted sky. In the shadow of
                                 the church across the way, children were romping,
                                 their ecstatic trebles floating like bird-song on the
                                 air.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9405">With the cigar between his teeth, Dudley heaved
                                 a sudden reminiscent sigh—the sigh of a man who
                                 possesses an excellent digestion and a complacent
                                 conscience.  Things had gone well with him of late
                                 —the fact that a trivial domestic interest darkened
                                 for the moment his serene horizon proved it to be
                                 the solitary cloud of a clear day.  The cloud in
                                 question had gathered in the shape of no less a
                                 person than Mrs. Jane Dudley Webb.  She had been
                                 on a visit to Richmond, and he had seen her only
                                 two hours before safely started on her homeward
                                 journey.  The truth was that Mrs. Webb and Eugenia
                                 had asserted for the past two days an implacable
                                 hostility, and Dudley's genial efforts at pacification
                                 had resulted merely in diverting a share of the
                                 unpleasantness upon his own head.  It was a
                                 lamentable fact that Eugenia, who was amiable to
                                 the point of weakness where members of the Battle
                                 family were concerned, found it impossible to
                                 harmonise with the elder Mrs. Webb.  They had disagreed
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9407"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="385" data-tei-n="398"> </a></span>
                                 upon such important subjects as Miss Chris's
                                 housekeeping and Dudley's moral welfare, until
                                 Eugenia, after an inglorious defeat, had relapsed into
                                 silence—a silence broken only upon Dudley's
                                 return from the station, when she had unbosomed
                                 herself of the declaration that she “couldn't stand
                                 his mother, and it was as much as she could do to
                                 stand him.”  Dudley had met this alarming outburst
                                 with its logical retort, “Hadn't you better see a
                                 doctor, Eugie?” whereupon Eugenia had protested
                                 that “if she wasn't fit for an asylum, he needn't
                                 thank Mrs. Webb,” and had dissolved in tears.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9410">At the moment Dudley had experienced a warm
                                 recognition of his generosity in refraining from the
                                 use of his own endurance of many Battles, as an
                                 illustration of the opposite and virtuous course; but
                                 upon later reflection he frankly admitted that the
                                 cases were by no means similar.  It had not occurred
                                 to him, he recalled, to deny that Mrs. Webb was
                                 singularly trying, though he wondered, half
                                 resentfully, why Eugenia could not be brought to
                                 regard that lady's foibles from his own gently
                                 humorous point of view.  He was not in the least
                                 disconcerted by his mother's solicitude as to the
                                 condition of his soul, or by the fact that she still felt
                                 constrained to allude to the governor of the State as
                                 “a person of low antecedents.”  Personally, he was
                                 inclined to admire—and frankly to admit it—the
                                 ability which had brought Burr into prominence from
                                 a position of evident obscurity, while he regarded
                                 Mrs. Webb's eccentric attitude as a kind of
                                 antedated comedy.  What he objected to was his
                                 wife's inability to grasp the keynote of the situation.

                                 leisurely descended the steps, that he had brought
                                 Eugenia round by less heroic measures than an
                                 assault upon her family altars.  He was glad to
                                 think that he had given her a cup of tea instead.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9419">Crossing slowly to Franklin Street, he hesitated an
                                 instant on the corner, and turned finally in the
                                 direction of his office.  There was a nearer way
                                 down town, but he always chose this one because
                                 experience had taught him that if pretty women
                                 were abroad here they would be found.  With the
                                 same instinct of enjoyment he might have gone out
                                 of his way daily to pass the window of a florist.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9422">As he walked on in the spring sunshine he held
                                 his handsome head erect, blowing the smoke of his
                                 cigar in the scented air.  He moved leisurely, finding
                                 life too good to be wasted in rushing.  The soft
                                 atmosphere; the fragrance of his fine cigar; the
                                 beauty of the women he passed—these sufficed to
                                 bring the glow of animation to his smooth, full face.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9425">Once he stopped to shake hands with pretty
                                 Emma Carr, detaining her by a jest and a laugh—
                                 and again he paused to exchange a word with Juliet
                                 Galt, who was at her window.  It was only when he
                                 turned into the business street again that he brought
                                 his mind to bear upon less engaging subjects.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9428">Then it was that he remembered he had delivered
                                 the evening before his most successful oration.  He
                                 had spoken to a large audience upon “Personal
                                 Morality in Politics,” and he had received an
                                 appreciation that was prolonged and thundering.
                                 When it was over some one had called him a
                                 “greater orator then Withers,” to add quickly, ”and a better
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9430"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="387" data-tei-n="400"> </a></span>
                                 Democrat than Burr.”  He could still see the
                                 whimsical smile Burr had turned upon the
                                 speaker, and he could still feel his own sense of
                                 elation.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9433">Well, as for that matter, he was a better
                                 Democrat than Burr—if to be a better Democrat
                                 meant to place the party will above his personal
                                 opinion.  After all, what was a party for if not to
                                 unite individual effort and to combine individual
                                 differences?  If organisation was not worth the
                                 sacrifice of personal prejudices it might as well
                                 dissolve before the next election day.  It was, of
                                 course, a pity that a man like Burr should dissent
                                 from the views of important politicians, but one
                                 might as well talk of a ship without officers as of a
                                 party without organised leaders.  It was a pity from
                                 Burr's point of view, he was willing to admit, but so
                                 long as Burr would make trouble it was just as well
                                 that the ill wind should blow his own side good—he
                                 was honestly glad that it had blown Rann's influence
                                 in his direction.  He had never felt more hopeful of
                                 anything in his life than he now felt of the
                                 senatorship.  Indeed, he was inclined to think that he
                                 might have something very like a “walk over.”

                              <p id="d44710e9437">“Hold on, Webb,” a voice called behind him, and
                                 a moment later he was joined by Diggs, who
                                 congratulated him upon his speech of the evening
                                 before.  Webb tossed back the congratulations with
                                 a laugh.  “Yes, it's a popular subject just now,” he
                                 said.  “Since the negroes have stopped voting in
                                 large numbers we're even going in for honest
                                 elections.”

                              <p id="d44710e9440">“Well, I reckon it's as well,” admitted Diggs.
                                 “We used to have some rampant rascality under
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9442"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="388" data-tei-n="401"> </a></span>
                                 the old system, I dare say; it took clever trickery to
                                 bring in the white rule sometimes.  We have a large
                                 negro majority down my way, that obliged us to
                                 devise original methods of disposing of it.  It was
                                 fighting the devil with fire, I suppose; but self-preservation
                                 was a law long before Universal Suffrage
                                 was heard of.  At any rate, I had my hand
                                 in it now and then.  Once, I remember, on an
                                 election day when every darkey in the
                                 neighbourhood had turned out to vote, I hit on the
                                 idea that the man who was to carry the returns
                                 across the river should pretend to get drunk and
                                 upset the boat.  It was a pretty scheme and would
                                 have worked all right, but, will you believe it, the
                                 blamed fool got drunk in earnest, and when the boat
                                 upset he was caught under it and drowned.”  He
                                 paused an instant and complacently added: “But we
                                 lost those returns, all the same.”

                              <p id="d44710e9445">Webb threw his cigar stump in the gutter and
                                 turned to Diggs with a laugh.  “That reminds me,”
                                 he began, and started a story which he finished on
                                 his office steps.

                                 that Eugenia had regained her high good-humour.
                                 She was sitting before the fire in her bedroom, her
                                 hair flowing in the hands of Delphy, who had moved
                                 up from Kingsborough, and was doing a thriving
                                 trade as a shampooer.  It was her fortnightly
                                 custom to pass from head to head in a round of the
                                 Kingsborough colony, promoting an intimate trend
                                 of gossip among her patrons.

                              <p id="d44710e9451">As Dudley entered, she was seeking to induce
                                 Eugenia to consent to an application from one of the
                                 many bottles she carried in an ancient travelling

                                 inquired with interest.  “What's become of Moses?
                                 Moses was always a friend of mine.  He used to

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9484">When Delphy had gone, Dudley leaned down and
                                 put his arm about Eugenia as he kissed her.  “All
                                 right, Eugie?” he asked cheerfully.  Eugenia
                                 returned his caress with a startled pleasure, looking
                                 up at him affectionately, fascinated by the glow
                                 which hung about him.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9487">“Oh, I really don't think I could do without you,
                                 Dudley,” she said quickly.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9490">“Well, it's a good thing you don't have to,”
                                 responded Dudley as he kissed her again.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9493">It was several days after this that Eugenia came
                                 to him one evening as he stood before the fire and
                                 laid her cool cheek against his arm.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9496">“Oh, Dudley,” she said breathlessly, “I am so
                                 happy—so absurdly happy.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9500">She raised her head and Dudley, looking at her in
                                 the firelight, found her more beautiful than she had
                                 been even in the radiant days of her girlhood.  He
                                 had seen that high resolve in her face but once
                                 before, and he grasped the meaning now as then—
                                 it was the dawn of motherhood that enveloped her.
                                 She had heard the call of the generations in the end
                                 —the appeal of the race that moved her nature
                                 more profoundly than did the erratic ardours of the
                                 individual.  There was a clear light in her eyes, and
                                 her features had taken an almost marble-like
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9502"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="391" data-tei-n="404"> </a></span>
                                 nobility.  The look in her face reminded him of moments in
                                 the old days at Battle Hall, when she had wrapped the
                                 wandering general in a tenderness that was maternal.
                                 With a sudden penetrant insight into her heart, he
                                 realised that her natural emotions were her nobler
                                 ones—that as child and mother the greatness of her
                                 nature assumed its visible form.  He drew her closer, the
                                 best in him responding to the mystery he beheld dimly in
                                 her eyes.  For ten years they had not touched natures so
                                 nearly; it was the vital breath needed to vivify a union
                                 which was not rooted in the permanence of an enduring
                                 passion.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9505">And as the months went on the wonder deepened in
                                 Eugenia's eyes.  The old restlessness was gone; she was
                                 like one who, having looked into the holy of holies,
                                 keeps the inward memory clear.  She was in the supreme
                                 mental state—attained only by religious martyrs or
                                 maternal, yet childless, women long married—when
                                 physical pain loses its relative values before the
                                 exaltation of an abiding vision.  And, above all, she was
                                 what each woman of her race had
                                 been before her—a mother from her birth.

                              <p id="d44710e9517">From the day of the child's birth it did not leave
                                 Eugenia's sight.  Her eyes followed it when it was carried
                                 about the room, and she watched wistfully the dressing
                                 and undressing of the round little body.  She knew each
                                 separate frock that she had made before its coming, and
                                 each day she called for a different and a daintier one.  “I
                                 must make new ones,” she said at last, “he is such a
                                 beauty!”  And she would hold out her arms for him, half
                                 dressed as he was, and, as he lay beside her, fresh and
                                 cool and fragrant as a cowslip ball, she would cover the
                                 soft pink flesh with passionate kisses.  Her motherhood
                                 was an obsession, jealous, intense, unreasoning.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9520">They had named him after the general—Thomas Battle
                                 Webb, but to Eugenia he was “the baby,” the solitary
                                 baby in a universe where birth is as common as death.
                                 And, indeed, he was a thing of joy—the nurse, Dudley,
                                 Miss Chris, all admitted it.  There was never so round, so
                                 rosy, so altogether marvellous a baby, and never one
                                 that laughed so much or cried so little.  “He was born
                                 with a silver spoon in his mouth,” declared Miss Chris.
                                 “I can see his luck already in his eyes.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9523">At first Eugenia had been tortured by a fear that the
                                 little life would go out as the other had done; but, as the
                                 weeks went on and he lived and fed and
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9525"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="393" data-tei-n="406"> </a></span>
                                 fattened, her fear was lost in the wondering rapture
                                 of possession.  Nothing so perfectly alive could
                                 cease to be.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9528">When she was well again she dismissed the
                                 nurse and took, herself, entire charge of the child.
                                 “There are no mammies these days,” she had said in
                                 reply to Dudley's remonstrances, “and I can't trust
                                 him with one of the new negroes—I really can't.
                                 Why, I saw one slap a baby once.”  So she bathed
                                 and dressed him in the mornings and rocked him to
                                 sleep at midday and at dark, and in the brightness of
                                 the forenoon gave him an airing on the piazza that
                                 overlooked the back garden.  From the time of her
                                 getting up to her lying down he left her arms only
                                 when he was laid asleep in the little crib beside her
                                 bed.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9532">But, for all this, he was a healthy, hearty baby,
                                 with a round bald head, great blue eyes like china
                                 marbles, and a ridiculous mouth that would not shut
                                 over the pink gums and hide the dimples at the
                                 corners.  He did not cry because, as yet, he hadn't
                                 seen the moon, and the lamp had been carefully
                                 emptied and given to him as soon as he was big
                                 enough to hold out his hands.  Pins had not stuck
                                 him, because Eugenia had guarded against the
                                 danger by sewing ribbons on his tiny innumerable
                                 slips.  And he was as amiable as his elders are apt
                                 to be so long as they are permitted to regard the
                                 visible universe as a possible plaything.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9535">At this time it was Eugenia's custom to hold him
                                 on her lap while she ate her meals, or to leave Miss
                                 Chris in charge if the small tyrant chanced to be
                                 asleep.  Miss Chris had become a willing servitor;
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9537"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="394" data-tei-n="407"> </a></span>
                                 but she occasionally felt it to be her duty to put a
                                 modest check upon Eugenia's maternal frenzy.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9540">“My dear, there were ten of us,” she remarked
                                 one day, “and I am sure we never required as
                                 much attention as this one.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9543">“And nine of you died,” Eugenia solemnly
                                 retorted.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9546">Miss Chris was compelled to assent; but she
                                 immediately added: “Not until we had reached
                                 middle age.  Belinda died youngest, and it was of
                                 pneumonia, at the age of forty-one.  You don't think
                                 neglect during her infancy had anything to do with
                                 it, do you?  Nobody ever accused my poor dear
                                 mother of not looking after her children.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9549">But Eugenia stood her ground.  “One can never
                                 tell,” was all she said, though a moment later she
                                 wiped her eyes and sobbed: “Oh, papa!  If papa
                                 could only see him!  He would be so proud.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9553">“Of course, darling,” said Miss Chris.  “He was
                                 always fond of children.  I remember distinctly the
                                 way he carried on when his first child was born—
                                 but he lost him of croup before he was a month
                                 old.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9556">She left the room to see after the housekeeping,
                                 and Eugenia hugged the baby to her bosom, and
                                 cried over him and kissed him, and thought his eyes
                                 were like her father's—though, for that matter, the
                                 general's were gray and watery, with weak red lids
                                 that blinked.  The baby gurgled and showed his
                                 gums still more and clutched the lace upon his
                                 mother's breast until it hung in shreds.  It was a new
                                 gown, but neither Eugenia nor the baby cared for
                                 that—if he had wanted to pull her hair out, strand
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9558"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="395" data-tei-n="408"> </a></span>
                                 by strand, she would have submitted rather than
                                 have brought a wrinkle to his cloudless brow.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9561">A little later she took him out upon the sidewalk,
                                 after swathing him from head to foot in a light-blue
                                 veil that floated about her like a strip of sky.  It was
                                 here that Juliet Galt found her, as she was passing,
                                 and, throwing back her pretty head, she laughed
                                 until the tears came.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9564">“O Eugie, Eugie, if you had six!” she gasped.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9567">Eugenia flinched slightly at her merriment.  “But,
                                 Juliet, I can't trust him with a nurse.  Why, you told
                                 me only the other day that your faithful old Fanny
                                 called Elizabeth an ‘imp of Satan.’ ”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9570">Juliet only wrung her hands and laughed the
                                 more.  “It's too funny,” she panted at last; “but I'm
                                 sure if Fanny said it about Elizabeth it was true
                                 —she never tells stories.”  Then she rippled off
                                 again.  “Oh, my poor Dudley!  How does he endure
                                 it?  Why, Ben would ship the babies off to boarding
                                 school if I attempted this.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9574">“Dudley tries to be good about it,” replied
                                 Eugenia, “but he hates it awfully.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9577">Juliet went by, and Eugenia kept up her slow
                                 promenade until Dudley came up to dinner.  Then
                                 she followed him into the house and upstairs to her
                                 room, where he turned upon her reproachfully:
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9580">“I say, Eugie, I wish you'd stop this sort of thing.
                                 It isn't fair to me, you know.”
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e9586">“But it isn't.  People will begin to say that I'm
                                 bankrupt or a beast.  If you will go parading round
                                 like this, for heaven's sake hire a servant or two to
                                 follow after; it'll look more decent.”

                              <p id="d44710e9592">Eugenia's response was far from satisfactory,
                                 and the next morning, before going to his office, he
                                 drew Miss Chris aside and unburdened himself into
                                 her sympathetic ear.  “You don't think Eugie's a—a
                                 —exactly crazy, do you, Aunt Chris?” he wound up
                                 with, for Miss Chris was on his side, and he knew
                                 it.

                                 was her comforting rejoinder.  “Why, she actually
                                 had the face to tell me yesterday that I'd never had
                                 any children, so I couldn't advise her.  It is
                                 provoking.  I don't pretend to deny it.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9598">Dudley took up his hat and carefully examined
                                 the inside lining.  “Well, I'll settle it,” he said at last,
                                 and went out.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9601">The next day, when Eugenia went upstairs from
                                 dinner, she found Delphy in a nurse's cap and
                                 apron, installed in a low chair before the fire, jolting
                                 the baby on her knees with a peculiar rhythmic
                                 motion.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9604">Eugenia fell back, regarding her with blank
                                 amazement.  “Why, Delphy, where did you come
                                 from?” she exclaimed.  “I didn't know you were in
                                 service.  Whom are you nursing for?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9607">Delphy responded with a passive nod.  “I'se
                                 nussin' for Marse Dudley,” she retorted.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9611">“But I don't want a nurse, Delphy.  I take care of
                                 the baby myself.  I like to do it.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9614">Delphy kept up her drowsy jolting, shaking at the
                                 same time an unrelenting head.  “Go 'long wid you,
                                 honey,” she returned.  “I ain' oner yo' new-come

                              <p id="d44710e9619">“O Delphy!” gasped Eugenia reproachfully.  She
                                 made a dart at the baby, but he raised a shrill protest,
                                 which caused her hopelessly to desist.  “O Delphy,
                                 you've come between us!” she cried.
                              </p>

                                 Delphy's justification.  “Dis yer chile's my bizness, en

                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9625">Eugenia wavered and stood irresolute.  Delphy's
                                 authority, rooted in superior knowledge, appeared to be
                                 unshakable, but she made a last desperate effort.
                                 “Suppose he should get sick without me, Delphy?”
                              </p>

                                 beaming down upon his offspring as it lay, round and
                                 pinkly impressive, in Delphy's lap.  “Fine boy, eh,
                                 Delphy?” he inquired proudly.

                                 for several days, and Eugenia was left with Miss

                                 Chris and the child.  Lottie and the little girls were with
                                 Bernard, who was dragging to a tedious end in Florida,
                                 where he had been ordered as a last resource.  Poor,
                                 pretty, ineffectual Lottie had succumbed to the
                                 unrelenting pressure of her duty.  She had sacrificed
                                 herself from sheer lack of the force necessary to
                                 withstand fate.

                              <p id="d44710e9643">During Dudley's absence Eugenia gave herself up to
                                 as much of the baby as Delphy grudgingly allowed her,
                                 sewing, in the long intervals, on tiny slips as delicate as
                                 cobwebs.  Even this occupation was not wholly a
                                 peaceful one.  “Des wait twel he begin ter crawl, en' den
                                 whar'l dose spider webs be?” propounded Delphy in
                                 the afternoon of the third day.  “Dey'll be in de ash-ba'r'l
                                 er at de back er de fireplace, en dat's whar dey belong.

                              <p id="d44710e9646">Eugenia did not respond.  She seated herself beside
                                 the window, and with one eye on her child and one on
                                 her work sewed silently, her white hands gleaming amid
                                 the laces in her lap.  The training of her slave-holding
                                 ancestors was strong upon her, and she regarded
                                 Delphy's liberty of speech as an inherent right of her
                                 position.  The Battle servants had always spoken their
                                 minds to their mistresses in a manner which caused them
                                 to become hopeless failures when they hired themselves
                                 into strange families, where the devotion of their lives
                                 could not be offered in extenuation of the freedom of
                                 their tongues.

                              <p id="d44710e9649">So when Eugenia spoke, after a placid pause, it was
                                 merely to suggest that the baby's head was hanging too
                                 far over Delphy's knee.  “That can't
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9651"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="399" data-tei-n="412"> </a></span>
                                 be healthful, Delphy,” she said, half timidly.  Delphy
                                 grunted and adjusted matters with a protest.  “Hit's
                                 de way yourn done hung en Miss Meely's done
                                 hung befo' you,” she muttered.  Eugenia turned to
                                 the window and looked out upon the back yard,
                                 where the horse-chestnut tree was a mass of
                                 bloom, delicate as a cloud.  In the beds below, roses
                                 were out in red and white, and against the gray wall
                                 of the stable at the end of the brick walk purple
                                 flags were flaunting in the shadow.  Across the city,
                                 beyond the tin roofs and the chimney-pots, the sun
                                 was going down in a mist as sheer as gauze, and the
                                 surrounding atmosphere was charged with
                                 opalescent lights.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9655">Her eyes rested upon it with a quick sense of its
                                 beauty; then the sunset lost itself in the round of her
                                 thoughts.  She had missed Dudley, and she was glad
                                 that he was coming home to-night.  For the first time
                                 during the fifteen years of her marriage she
                                 experienced a vague uneasiness at his absence.  A
                                 year ago she had not known a tremor of loneliness
                                 when he was away—but then the child was unborn.
                                 Now, in some subtle way, the child's existence was
                                 bound and rebound in Dudley's.  The two stood
                                 together in her thoughts; she could not separate
                                 them—the child was but a smaller, a closer, a
                                 dearer Dudley—a Dudley of her dreams and
                                 visions, the ideal ending to life's realities.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9658">As she sat beside the window, her eyes
                                 wandering from the sunset to the baby asleep in
                                 Delphy's lap, she wondered that she had never
                                 before suffered this incipient thrill of nervous fear.
                                 Was it that her affection for her child had revivified
                                 all lesser emotions?
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9660"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="400" data-tei-n="413"> </a></span>
                                 Or was it that with supreme love came the
                                 vague, invincible perception of supreme loss?  Did
                                 great happiness bear within itself the visible
                                 reflection of great sorrow?  Her life before this had
                                 been more peaceful—it had been also less
                                 complete.  With the coming of her heart's desire had
                                 awakened her heart's inquietude—both had dawned
                                 after years of restless waiting and uncertain
                                 wandering.  It was borne in upon her, with something
                                 like a pang, that the fulness of life had blossomed
                                 for her only when her first youth was withered,
                                 when she had long since relinquished high
                                 expectations or keen desire. She had set her young
                                 mind and her quick passion on a far-away good, she
                                 had shed vain tears over the lack of it; yet, in the
                                 end, she found compensation where she would least
                                 have sought it—in the things which made up her
                                 destiny.  She had learned the wisdom of acceptance,
                                 and Fate had rewarded her, not by yielding to her
                                 what she had called her heart's necessity, but by
                                 fitting her heart to the necessity that was already
                                 hers.  She had not known the fulfilment of her young
                                 ideals, but she was content at last with an existence
                                 which was a personal surrender to older realities.
                                 For herself she asked now only busy days of
                                 domestic interests and the unbroken serenity of
                                 middle age—but, despite herself, another life was
                                 before her, for she lived again in her child.

                              <p id="d44710e9663">The twilight fell.  She put her work aside, and,
                                 coming to the hearth rug, took the baby from
                                 Delphy's arms.  He was in his night-dress, and his
                                 big blue eyes were drugged with sleep.  As Eugenia
                                 took him he gave a whimpering cry and clutched
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9665"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="401" data-tei-n="414"> </a></span>
                                 her with his little hands before he nestled into the
                                 lace at her bosom.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9668">Some hours later, while Eugenia awaited Dudley
                                 in the dining-room, Miss Chris came in to see that
                                 his late supper was in preparation.  “The train is
                                 over-due,” she said, with a glance at the clock.  “He
                                 will be hungry when he gets in.  He always is.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9671">Eugenia looked up anxiously.  “I am beginning to
                                 feel alarmed,” she replied.  “Can anything have
                                 happened, do you think?  He is an hour late.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9674">Miss Chris shook her head as she refilled the
                                 sugarbowl.  “Why, he's often late,” she rejoined.  “I
                                 never knew you to be nervous before.  What is it?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9678">“Oh, I don't know,” said Eugenia.  She rose and
                                 stood looking at the clock, her brow wrinkling.  “If
                                 he isn't here in five minutes I'm going to the station,”
                                 she added, and went upstairs for her wraps.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9681">When she returned Miss Chris resorted to
                                 argument.  “Don't be absurd, Eugie,” she urged.
                                 “You can't go alone.  It's too late and too far.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9684">“But I sent for a carriage,” replied Eugenia
                                 decisively.  “If anything happens to the baby come
                                 after me,” and a moment later she rolled away,
                                 leaving Miss Chris transfixed upon the doorstep.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9687">As the carriage passed along the lighted streets
                                 she smiled at the recollection of the face Miss Chris
                                 had turned upon her.  Well, she was absurd, of
                                 course, but one couldn't go through life being
                                 reasonable.  And if anything were to happen to
                                 Dudley she would always remember that she had
                                 refused to go to walk with him the afternoon before
                                 he went away, because the baby was crying for the flames
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9689"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="402" data-tei-n="415"> </a></span>
                                 and couldn't be left with Delphy.  Dudley was
                                 provoked about it, but men never understood these
                                 matters.  He had even gone so far as to declare that
                                 his son would get only his deserts if he were to cry
                                 himself hoarse; and she had felt impelled to resent
                                 so hard-hearted an utterance.  How could the baby
                                 know that the fire was the only thing in the world he
                                 couldn't have for his own?
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9692">When she drew up at the station the train was
                                 just coming in, and she rushed through the
                                 waiting-room to the gate from which the passengers
                                 were streaming.  As she reached it Dudley came
                                 through, talking animatedly to the man who walked
                                 beside him.  “That was the very point, my dear sir  -”
                                 he was saying, when he caught sight of Eugenia,
                                 and paused abruptly, domestic affairs asserting their
                                 supremacy in his mind.  “Why, Eugie!” he gasped.
                                 “What's happened?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9695">Eugenia seized his arm impatiently.  “Oh, you
                                 were so late, Dudley,” she cried, half angrily.  “You
                                 made me miserable—it wasn't right of you!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9699">She hesitated an instant and, looking up, found
                                 that his companion was Nicholas Burr.  His eyes
                                 were upon her, and he lifted his hat without
                                 speaking, but Dudley at once turned to him.
                              </p>

                                 Governor,” he said lightly, “but you don't know the
                                 ways of a woman who thinks her husband may lose
                                 himself between Washington and Richmond.”

                              <p id="d44710e9705">Nicholas met the impatient flicker in Eugenia's

                                 she held herself erect and attacked him with
                                 asperity.  “You might at least not laugh at me,” she
                                 said.

                              <p id="d44710e9720">For reply he smiled and flung his arm about her.
                                 “My darling girl, it's one of the things that make life
                                 worth living,” he retorted.  “When I cease to laugh
                                 at you I'll cease to love you—and that's a long way
                                 off.”

                                 a United States Senator was warming to white
                                 heat.  On the last day of October Tom Bassett,
                                 dropping into Galt's office, greeted him with the
                                 exclamation: “So you've taken to the stump!”

                              <p id="d44710e9734">Galt put aside his papers and rose with a laugh,
                                 holding out his hand.  “My dear fellow, may I ask
                                 where you have spent the last fortnight?  Is it
                                 possible that my oratorical fame has just penetrated
                                 to your retreat?”

                              <p id="d44710e9737">Tom sat down, and taking off his hat, ran his
                                 hand through his hair with an exhausted gesture.
                                 “Oh, I've been West.  I got back last night, and I'm
                                 off to New York in an hour.  So it's a fact that
                                 you've been on the stump?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9740">“It is!  I don't mean to allow the Webb men to do
                                 all the talking.  You heard about my joint debate with
                                 Diggs at Amelia Court-house, didn't you?  That, my
                                 dear Tom, was the culminating point of my glorious
                                 career.  I squared him off as nicely as you please,
                                 and with no rough edges either.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9744">But Tom refused to be impressed.  “Oh, anybody
                                 could do up Diggs,” he said.  “I hear, however, that
                                 you had some hot words between you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9747">Galt shook his head.  “Ah, the words were as
                                 nothing to the drinks that followed,” he sighed.
                                 “Diggs mayn't be much on speeches, but he's great
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9749"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="405" data-tei-n="418"> </a></span>
                                 on cocktails.  It was a glorious day!”  Then he grew
                                 serious.  “When he was fairly wound up I got a
                                 good deal out of him,” he said.  “We came down on
                                 the train together, and I found out that he was
                                 against Burr simply because the Webb men had told
                                 him that he pledged himself to them when he
                                 allowed them to send him to the Legislature.  It's all
                                 rot, of course; his constituents are strong for Burr,
                                 but he's a good deal of a fool, and Rann has put it
                                 into his head that he must do the 'honest thing' by
                                 coming out for Webb.  He has a great idea of party
                                 honour, so out he's come.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9752">“Rann's a born organiser,” commented Tom.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9755">“Ah, there's where we aren't even with him.  He
                                 and his assistants have been drilling their forces
                                 ever since he had that clash with Burr, and the
                                 discipline's so good they are beginning to convince
                                 the people that the opinions of a dozen men
                                 represent the principles of the party.  What Burr
                                 aims at, of course, is to organise the mass of
                                 Democratic voters as effectively as Rann has
                                 organised the ring.”

                              <p id="d44710e9758">“That's a tough job,” said Tom, “but if it's to be
                                 done, Burr's the man to do it.  As it is, I haven't a
                                 doubt that the majority is with us.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9761">“Well, I live in hope,” returned Galt easily.  “It
                                 seems to me there's a clear chance of our having a
                                 good deal over half the votes in the caucus.  Now,
                                 grant that there'll be a hundred and twenty regular
                                 Democratic votes  -”

                              <p id="d44710e9768">“Claims!” growled Galt.  “He may claim the
                                 whole confounded lot if he wants to.  The question
                                 is—will he get them?”
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e9773">“He will if Rann can manage it.  It isn't mere
                                 party bitterness that actuates that man—there's a
                                 good deal of personal spite mixed with it.  He hates
                                 Burr.”

                                 when he tried to get control of the committee.  They
                                 decided in favour of Saunders in the last Southside
                                 contest, and Saunders is pledged to Burr.”

                              <p id="d44710e9779">Tom drew out his watch and moved towards the
                                 door, but having reached it, he swung round with a
                                 question: “Seen Webb since your debate?” he
                                 inquired.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9783">Galt nodded.  “I had a chat with him in the lobby
                                 at the ‘Royal’ last night, and I must admit that, so
                                 far as Webb's concerned, this campaign is a
                                 particularly decent one.  He can't help being a
                                 gentleman any more than he can help being a
                                 demagogue.  Both instincts are in the blood.”

                                 way, and Galt, after a moment's hesitation, took up
                                 his hat and followed him.  He had an appointment
                                 with Burr's campaign manager, who had his
                                 headquarters at the Royal Hotel.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9792">It was there that Galt found him, holding a jubilant
                                 gathering in his rooms.  He was absolutely sanguine
                                 of success, and when Galt left an hour later, he
                                 sought to impart to him his emphatic confidence.
                                 “My dear sir, I can conclusively prove to you that we
                                 shall win,” he said, one eye on Galt and one on a
                                 reporter who had just entered.  “I can prove it to
                                 you in figures—and figures never lie.

                                 There is not the faintest doubt that Burr will have
                                 seventy votes by the meeting of the caucus.”

                              <p id="d44710e9797">“Glad to hear it,” was Galt's response; but in
                                 passing through the lobby on his way out he
                                 encountered an equal assurance in the opposite
                                 camp.  Rann, who was the centre of a small group,
                                 broke away and came towards him.

                              <p id="d44710e9804">Galt shook his head with a laugh.  “Defeat!  Why,

                                 Burr has his seventy votes in his hand and he keeps

                                 paper—on paper, sir—that Webb has his majority
                                 as plain as if the caucus was over.  Seventy votes!
                                 Why, bless my soul, he must have counted in every
                                 Republican and Independent that will be sent up.
                                 Seventy votes!  I tell you he won't have forty—not
                                 forty, sir!”

                                 direction of the Capitol.  Once or twice he stopped
                                 to speak to an acquaintance who wanted his opinion
                                 of Burr's chances, and to such inquiries his
                                 response was invariably an expression of perfect
                                 conviction.  But when alone his uncertainty
                                 appeared—and he acknowledged to himself that he
                                 was afraid of Rann's last card.  What it was he did
                                 not know, but he knew that when the time came it
                                 would be well played.  Bassett was right—it was not party
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e9815"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="408" data-tei-n="421"> </a></span>
                                 bitterness that moved Rann, it was personal hatred.

                                 the green slopes gray squirrels were feeding from
                                 the hands of children.  Overhead the elms were
                                 russet from a sharp frost, and the golden leaves of
                                 the sycamores shone against the leprous whiteness
                                 of the branches.

                                 and then spoke cordially to the old negro janitor of

                                 this, I dare say—it's a copy of Diggs's speech at
                                 Danville.  So they have fallen on my private life at
                                 last.”

                              <p id="d44710e9919">He handed Galt a typewritten sheet, watching
                                 him closely as he read it.  “This looks as if they
                                 feared me, doesn't it?” he asked.

                              <p id="d44710e9923">Galt's reply was an oath of sudden anger.  “This
                                 is Rann!” he cried.  “I see his mark!”  A flush of
                                 red rose to his face and his voice came again in a
                                 long-drawn whistle of helpless rage.  “The
                                 scoundrel!” he said sharply.  “He's raked up that
                                 old Kingsborough scandal of Bernard Battle's and
                                 made you the man.  Oh, the sneaking scoundrel!”

                                 other's composure.  He was resenting the slander
                                 with a violence that he would not have wasted on it
                                 had it touched himself—for the fame of his friend
                                 was a cause for which his easy-going nature would
                                 spring at once into arms.

                                 shoulder.  “When you come to think of it, Ben,” he
                                 said, “it's no great matter.”

                              <p id="d44710e9944">He checked himself abruptly.  “How long have

                              <p id="d44710e9953">The governor laughed dryly.  “To tell the truth,
                                 my dear fellow, I don't take it seriously.  The people
                                 know me.”

                                 his hand.  “Oh, give over, Nick,” he implored.
                                 “Don't drive me to frenzy!  I can't stand much more.”

                              <p id="d44710e9959">He took up a sheet of paper and wrote several
                                 lines in pencil.  “After all, I've been thinking to some
                                 purpose,” he said.  “Judge Bassett is the man we
                                 need.  I'll telegraph to him from your office, and I'll
                                 have his reply scattered broadcast.  If it riddles
                                 Webb like shot, I'll have it out.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e9963">“Oh, it isn't Webb,” said Nicholas.  He was looking
                                 into the fire, but as the door closed behind Galt he
                                 turned and seated himself at his desk.  The law-book
                                 he had been reading lay to one side, and he opened
                                 it and followed up the question that perplexed him.
                                 His face was grave, but his eyes were shot with
                                 light.  When Galt came back he entered

                                 slowly and hesitated an instant before speaking,
                                 then he said:

                                 stroke of paralysis.  He is now unconscious.  Tom

                              <p id="d44710e9971">Nicholas took out his watch.  “I have fifteen
                                 minutes in which to make that train,” was his
                                 answer.  “Will you tell Dickson to repeat all
                                 messages?”  Then, as Galt followed him into the
                                 hall, he looked back and spoke again.  “Until
                                 tomorrow,” he said, and went out.

                              <p id="d44710e9974">Galt delivered the message to Dickson and
                                 walked uptown to Webb's house, where he
                                 expected to find him.  He had not lunched, and he
                                 remembered suddenly that Nicholas had also gone
                                 hungry; but the thought brought a smile as he rang
                                 Webb's bell.  “Oh, for once in a lifetime a man may
                                 be heroic,” he said.  Then he entered the house and
                                 found, not Dudley, but Eugenia.

                                 swiftly forward with outstretched hand.  Her face
                                 was white and her eyes heavy with anxiety, but he
                                 felt then, as always, the calm nobility of her
                                 carriage.  In the added fulness of her figure her
                                 beauty showed majestic.

                              <p id="d44710e9980">He took her hand, holding it warmly in his own.
                                 “My dear Eugenia, if you are in trouble, remember
                                 that I am an ignoble edition of Juliet.”

                                 sent for Dudley, but he has not come—I took the
                                 paper at the door by chance—and I find that
                                 Colonel Diggs has brought up that old dead lie
                                 about the governor.  He dares to say that the

                                 they attack our own lives—that's our code for you.
                                 If it were otherwise, I should act upon it with
                                 pleasure.  But I came to see Webb about this thing.
                                 Where is he?”

                                 know it.  The world shall know it if I have to utter it
                                 from the housetops.  Oh, I have sinned enough in
                                 ignorance; now I will speak.”

                                 tapping her foot upon the floor.  The red was in her

                                 bosom quivered from the lash of her scorn.

                                 hands upon his arm.  “Dudley, have you seen it—
                                 this falsehood?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10011">He let her hands fall from his arm and drew her

                                 with him to the fireside.  “Yes; I have seen it,” he
                                 answered, and as he shook hands heartily with Galt
                                 he made a casual remark about the weather.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10016">“Oh, Dudley, what does the weather matter?”
                                 cried Eugenia.  “No, don't sit down.  You are to go
                                 at once to Colonel Diggs and tell him everything
                                 —and not spare any one—and you may tell him
                                 also that—I despise him!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10019">He smiled at her vehemence—it was so unlike
                                 Eugenia.  “I didn't know you took so much interest
                                 in these things,” he said lightly.  “I thought the baby
                                 had cured you.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10022">But she caught his hand and held it in her own.
                                 “Don't, Dudley,” she implored.  “You know what it
                                 means to me.  You know all.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10026">His face softened as he met her eyes; but instead
                                 of replying to her appeal he turned with a question
                                 to Galt.  “Can I do any good?” he asked.  “I am
                                 willing, of course, to do what I can.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10029">“I was going to ask you to see Diggs,” said Galt
                                 quietly.  “We shall endeavour to keep his speech out
                                 of the morning papers, but it has already appeared
                                 in the evening issue.  You might secure a card from
                                 him retracting his statements.  I hardly think he
                                 knew them to be false.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10032">“I'll go at once,” replied Dudley.  He went into the
                                 hall and took up his hat, but as Galt opened the door
                                 he lingered an instant and looked at his wife.  She
                                 came to him, her eyes shining, and in a flash he
                                 realised that to Eugenia it was a question of his own
                                 honour as well as of the governor's.  With a smile he
                                 lifted her chin and met her gaze.  “Are you
                                 satisfied, my lady?” he asked; but before
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10034"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="416" data-tei-n="429"> </a></span>
                                 she could respond he had joined Galt upon the
                                 pavement.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10037">There he paused to light a cigar, while Galt
                                 hesitated and looked at his watch.  “I suppose I may
                                 leave it in your hands,” suggested the older man.
                                 “Diggs isn't on the best of terms with me, you
                                 know.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10040">Dudley took the cigar from his mouth and threw
                                 the match over the railing into the grass.  “Oh, I'll do
                                 my best,” he answered readily, “and I'll see that the
                                 statements are delivered to the newspapers at
                                 once.  I am as much interested in it as you are.  It
                                 was a dirty piece of work.”  And leaving Galt, he
                                 quickened his pace as he crossed the street.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10043">Diggs was at his hotel and somewhat relieved at
                                 the sudden turn of affairs.  “Honestly, I hated it,” he
                                 frankly admitted.  “It's the kind of job I'd like to
                                 wash my hands of.  But Major Rann took oath on
                                 the truth of the story, and he convinced me that I
                                 owed it to the community to expose Burr's
                                 character.  I don't know why I believed it, except
                                 that it never occurs to one to doubt evil.  However,
                                 I'm glad you called.  I assure you I'll take more
                                 pleasure in retracting the statements than I did in
                                 making them.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10047">He wrote the notes and gave them into Dudley's
                                 hands.  “If they don't get in to-morrow's issue, they
                                 must wait over till election day.  It's a pity this is
                                 Saturday—but you'll have them in, I dare say.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10050">“Yes; I'll take them down,” said Dudley.  He
                                 descended in the elevator, walking rapidly when he
                                 reached the pavement.  Diggs's parting words came
                                 back to him and he repeated them as he went.  Tomorrow's
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10052"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="417" data-tei-n="430"> </a></span>
                                 was the last paper before election day.  If
                                 the speech were reported in the morning issue and
                                 Burr's friends made no denial, there would be, as
                                 far as the country voters were concerned, a silence
                                 of two days.  The contest was not yet decided, this
                                 he knew—it would be a close one, and a straw's
                                 weight might turn the scales of public favour.  Rann
                                 realised this too, for he did not fling slime at men for
                                 nothing—there was a serious purpose underneath
                                 the last act of his play.  He was doing it for the sake
                                 of those Democrats whose constituents were
                                 divided against themselves, and he was trusting to
                                 himself to hold the votes that came his way when
                                 the cloud should have passed from Burr again.  It
                                 was all so evident that Dudley held his breath for
                                 one brief instant.  The whole scheme lay bare before
                                 him—he had but to drop these letters into the
                                 nearest box, and Rann's purpose would be fulfilled.
                                 In the howl of reprobation that followed the
                                 hounding of Burr his own hour would come.  And
                                 granted that the governor was cleared before the
                                 meeting of the caucus—well, men are easier to
                                 keep than to win—and he might not be cleared after
                                 all.

                              <p id="d44710e10055">A clock near at hand struck the hour.  He raised
                                 his head and saw the “Standard” office across the
                                 street—and the temptation passed as swiftly as it
                                 had come.  The instinct of generations was stronger
                                 than the appeal of the moment—he might sin a
                                 great sin, but he could never commit a meanness.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10058">With sudden energy he crossed the street and
                                 ran up the stairs.

                                 familiar landscape rushed by him on either side—
                                 green meadow and russet woodland, gray swamp
                                 and dwarfed brown hill, unploughed common and
                                 sun-ripened field of corn.  It was like the
                                 remembered features of a friend, when the change
                                 that startles the unaccustomed eye seems to exist
                                 less in the well-known face than in the image we
                                 have carried in our thoughts.

                                 same and yet not the same.  The old fields were
                                 tilled, the old lands ran waste in broomsedge, but he
                                 himself had left his boyhood far behind—it was his
                                 own vision that was altered, not the face of nature.
                                 The commons were not so wide as he had thought
                                 them, the hills not so high, the hollows not so
                                 deep—even the blue horizon had drawn a closer
                                 circle.

                                 well.  Was the judge taken ill before you left
                                 Kingsborough?”

                              <p id="d44710e10090">“The judge?  Is he sick?  I ain't heard nothin' 'bout
                                 it.  It wa'n't more'n a week ago that I told him he
                                 was lookin' as young as he did befo' the war.  It ain't
                                 often a man can keep his youth like that—but his
                                 Caesar is just such another.  Caesar was an old man
                                 as far back as I remember, and, bless you, he's
                                 spryer than I am this minute. He'll live to be a
                                 hundred and die of an accident.”

                              <p id="d44710e10093">“That's good,” said the governor with rising
                                 interest.  “Kingsborough's a fine place to grow old
                                 in.  Did you bring any news up with you?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10096">“Well, I reckon not.  Things were pretty lively
                                 down there last night, but they'd quieted down this
                                 morning.  They brought a man over from
                                 Hagersville, you know, and befo' I shut up sto' last
                                 evening Jim Brown came to town, talkin' mighty big
                                 'bout stringin' up the fellow.  Jim always did talk,
                                 though, so nobody thought much of it.  He likes to
                                 get his mouth in, but he's right particular 'bout his
                                 hand.  The sheriff said he warn't lookin' for trouble.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10099">“I'm glad it's over,” said the governor.  The train
                                 was nearing Kingsborough, and as it stopped he
                                 rose and followed Jerry Pollard to the station.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10103">There was no one he knew in sight, and, with his
                                 bag in his hand, he walked rapidly to the judge's
                                 house.  His anxiety had caused him to quicken his
                                 pace, but when he had opened the gate and ascended
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10105"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="420" data-tei-n="433"> </a></span>
                                 the steps he hesitated before entering the hall, and
                                 his breath came shortly.  Until that instant he had not
                                 realised the strength of the tie that bound him to the
                                 judge.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10108">The hall was dim and cool, as it had been that
                                 May afternoon when his feet had left tracks of dust
                                 on the shining floor.  Straight ahead he saw the
                                 garden, lying graceless and deserted, with the
                                 unkemptness of extreme old age.  A sharp breeze
                                 blew from door to door, and the dried grasses on the
                                 wall stirred with a sound like that of the wind among
                                 a bed of rushes.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10111">He mounted the stairs slowly, the weight of his
                                 tread creaking the polished wood.  Before the
                                 threshold of the judge's room again he hesitated, his
                                 hand upraised.  The house was so still that it seemed
                                 to be untenanted, and he shivered suddenly, as if the
                                 wind that rustled the dried grasses were a ghostly
                                 footstep.  Then, as he glanced back down the wide
                                 old stairway, his own childhood looked up at
                                 him—an alien figure, half frightened by the silence.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10114">As he stood there the door opened noiselessly,
                                 and the doctor came out, peering with shortsighted
                                 eyes over his lowered glasses.  When he ran against
                                 Nicholas he coughed uncertainly and drew back.
                                 “Well, well, if it isn't the governor!” he said.  “We
                                 have been looking for Tom—but our friend the
                                 judge is better—much better.  I tell him he'll live yet
                                 to see us buried.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10117">A load passed suddenly from Nicholas's mind.
                                 The ravaged face of the old doctor—with its
                                 wrinkled forehead and its almost invisible eyes—became
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10119"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="421" data-tei-n="434"> </a></span>
                                 at once the mask of a good angel.  He
                                 grasped the outstretched hand and crossed the
                                 threshold.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10122">The judge was lying among the pillows of his bed,
                                 his eyes closed, his great head motionless.  There
                                 was a bowl of yellow chrysanthemums on a table
                                 beside him, and near it Mrs. Burwell was measuring
                                 dark drops into a wineglass.  She looked up with a
                                 smile of welcome that cast a cheerful light about the
                                 room.  Her smile and the colour of the
                                 chrysanthemums were in Nicholas's eyes as he
                                 went to the bed and laid his hand upon the still
                                 fingers that clasped the counterpane.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10126">The judge looked at him with a wavering
                                 recognition.  “Ah, it is you, Tom,” he said, and there
                                 was a yearning in his voice that fell like a gulf
                                 between him and the man who was not his son.  At
                                 the moment it came to Nicholas with a great
                                 bitterness that his share of the judge's heart was the
                                 share of an outsider—the crumbs that fall to the
                                 beggar that waits beside the gate.  When the soul
                                 has entered the depths and looks back again it is the
                                 face of its own kindred that it craves—the
                                 responsive throbbing of its own blood in another's
                                 veins.  This was Tom's place, not his.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10129">He leaned nearer, speaking in an expressionless
                                 voice.  “It's I, sir—Nicholas—Nicholas Burr.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10132">“Yes, Nicholas,” repeated the judge doubtfully;
                                 “yes, I remember, what does he want?  Amos Burr's
                                 son—we must give him a chance.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10135">For a moment he wandered on; then his memory
                                 returned in uncertain pauses.  He looked again at the
                                 younger man, his sight grown stronger.  “Why,
                                 Nicholas, my dear boy, this is good of you,” he exclaimed.
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10137"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="422" data-tei-n="435"> </a></span>
                                 “I had a fall—a slight fall of no
                                 consequence.  I shall be all right if Caesar will let me
                                 fast a while.  Caesar's getting old, I fear, he moves
                                 so slowly.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10140">He was silent, and Nicholas, sitting beside the
                                 bed, kept his eyes on the delicate features that were
                                 the lingering survival of a lost type.  The splendid
                                 breadth of the brow, the classic nose, the firm, thin
                                 lips, and the shaven chin—these were all downstairs
                                 on faded canvases, magnificent over lace ruffles, or
                                 severe above folded stocks.  Over the pillows the
                                 chrysanthemums shed a golden light that mingled in
                                 his mind with the warm brightness of Mrs. Burwell's
                                 smile—giving the room the festive glimmer of an
                                 autumn garden.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10143">A little later Caesar shuffled forward, the
                                 wine-glass in his hand.  The judge turned towards
                                 him.  “Is that you, Caesar?” he asked.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10147">The old negro hurried to the bedside.  “Here I is,
                                 Marse George; I'se right yer.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10150">The judge laughed softly.  “I wouldn't take five
                                 thousand dollars for you, Caesar,” he said.  “Tom
                                 Battle offered me one thousand for you, and I told
                                 him I wouldn't take five.  You are worth it, Caesar
                                 —every cent of it—but there's no man alive shall
                                 own you.  You're free, Caesar—do you hear, you're
                                 free!”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10153">“Thanky, Marse George,” said Caesar.  He passed
                                 his arm under the judge's head and raised him as
                                 he would a child.  As the glass touched his lips the
                                 judge spoke in a clear voice.  “To the ladies!” he
                                 cried.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10156">“He is regaining the use of his limbs,” whispered
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10158"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="423" data-tei-n="436"> </a></span>
                                 Mrs. Burwell softly.  “He will be well again,” and
                                 Nicholas left the room and went downstairs.  At the
                                 door he gave his instructions to a woman servant.
                                 “I shall return to spend the night,” he said.  “You will
                                 see that my room is ready.  Yes, I'll be back to
                                 supper.”  He had had no dinner, but at the moment
                                 this was forgotten.  In the relief that had come to
                                 him he wanted solitude and the breadth of the open
                                 fields.  He was going over the old ground again—to
                                 breathe the air and feel the dust of the Old Stage
                                 Road.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10161">He passed the naked walls of the church and
                                 followed the wide white street to the college gate.
                                 Then, turning, he faced the way to his father's farm
                                 and the distant pines emblazoned on the west.

                              <p id="d44710e10164">A clear gold light flooded the landscape, warming
                                 the pale dust of the deserted road. The air was keen
                                 with the autumn tang, and as he walked the quick
                                 blood leaped to his cheeks.  He was no longer
                                 conscious of his forty years—his boyhood was with
                                 him, and middle age was a dream, or less than a
                                 dream.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10168">In the branch road a fall of tawny leaves hid the
                                 ruts of wheels, and the sun, striking the ground like
                                 a golden lance, sent out sharp, fiery sparks as from
                                 a mine of light.  Overhead the red trees rustled.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10171">It was here that Eugenia had ridden beside him in
                                 the early morning—here he had seen her face
                                 against the enkindled branches—and here he had
                                 placed the scarlet gum leaves in her horse's bridle.
                                 The breeze in the wood came to him like the echo
                                 of her laugh, faded as the memory of his past
                                 passion.  Well, he had more than most men, for he
                                 had the ghost of a laugh and the shadow of love.
                              </p>

                              <p id="d44710e10176">Passing his father's house, he went on beyond the
                                 fallen shanty of Uncle Ish into the twilight of the
                                 cedars.  At the end of the avenue he saw the rows
                                 of box—twisted and tall with age—leading to the
                                 empty house, where the stone steps were wreathed
                                 in vines.  Did Eugenia ever come back, he
                                 wondered, or was the house to crumble as Miss
                                 Chris's rookery had done?  On the porch he saw the
                                 marks made by the general's chair, which had been
                                 removed, and on one of the long green benches
                                 there was an E cut in a childish hand.  At a window
                                 above—Eugenia's window—a shutter hung back
                                 upon its hinges, and between the muslin curtains it
                                 seemed to him that a face looked out and
                                 smiled—not the face of Eugenia, but a ghost again,
                                 the ghost of his old romance.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10179">He went into the garden, crossing the cattle lane,
                                 where the footprints of the cows were fresh in the
                                 dust.  Near at hand he heard a voice shouting.  It
                                 was the voice of the overseer, but the sound startled
                                 him, and he awoke abruptly to himself and his forty
                                 years.  The spell of the past was broken—even the
                                 riotous old garden, blending its many colours in a
                                 single blur, could not bring it back.  The
                                 chrysanthemums and the roses and the hardy zenias
                                 that came up uncared for were powerless to
                                 reinvoke the spirit of the place.  If Eugenia, in her
                                 full-blown motherhood, had risen in an overgrown
                                 path he might have passed her by unheeding.  His
                                 Eugenia was a girl in a muslin gown, endowed with
                                 immortal youth—the youth of visions unfulfilled
                                 and desire unquenched.  His Eugenia could never
                                 grow old—could never alter—could never leave
                                 the eternal
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10181"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="425" data-tei-n="438"> </a></span>
                                 sunshine of dead autumns.  In his nostrils was the
                                 keen sweetness of old-fashioned flowers, but his
                                 thoughts were not of them, and, turning presently,
                                 he went back as he had come.  It was dark when at
                                 last he reached the judge's house and sat down to
                                 supper.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10184">He was with the judge until midnight, when,
                                 before going to his room, he descended the stairs
                                 and went out upon the porch.  He had been thinking
                                 of the elections three days hence, and the outcome
                                 seemed to him more hopeful than it had done when
                                 he first came forward as a candidate.  The
                                 uncertainty was almost as great, this he granted; but
                                 behind him he believed to be the pressure of the
                                 people's will—which the schemes of politicians had
                                 not turned.  Tuesday would prove nothing—nor had
                                 the conventions that had been held; when the
                                 meeting of the caucus came, he would still be ignorance—
                                 unaware of traps that had been laid or
                                 surprises to be sprung.  It was the mark to which his
                                 ambition had aimed—the end to which his career
                                 had faced—that now rose before him, and yet in his
                                 heart there was neither elation nor distrust.  He had
                                 done his best—he had fought fairly and well, and he
                                 awaited what the day might bring forth.

                              <p id="d44710e10188">Above him a full moon was rising, and across the
                                 green the crooked path wound like a silver thread,
                                 leading to the glow of a night-lamp that burned in a
                                 sick-room. The night, the air, the shuttered houses
                                 were as silent as the churchyard, where the
                                 tombstones glimmered, row on row.  Only
                                 somewhere on the vacant green a hound bayed at
                                 the moon.

                              <p id="d44710e10193">He looked out an instant longer, and was turning
                                 back, when his eye caught a movement among the
                                 shadows in the distant lane.  A quick thought came
                                 to him, and he kept his gaze beneath the heavy
                                 maples, where the moonshine fell in flecks.  For a
                                 moment all was still, and then into the light came the
                                 figure of a man.  Another followed, another, and
                                 another, passing again into the dark and then out into
                                 the brightness that led into the little gully far beyond.
                                 There was no sound except the baying of the dog;
                                 the figures went on, noiseless and orderly and grim,
                                 from dark to light and from light again to dark.
                                 There were at most a dozen men, and they might
                                 have been a band of belated workmen returning to
                                 their homes or a line of revellers that had been
                                 sobered into silence.  They might have been—but a
                                 sudden recollection came to him, and he closed the
                                 door softly and went out.  There was but one thing
                                 that it meant; this he knew.  It meant a midnight
                                 attack on the gaol, and a man dead before morning,
                                 who must die anyway—it meant vengeance so quiet
                                 yet so determined that it was as sure as the hand of
                                 God—and it meant the defiance of laws whose
                                 guardian he was.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10196">He broke into a run, crossing the green and
                                 following the path that rose and fell into the gullies
                                 as it led on to the gaol.  As he ran he saw the glow
                                 of the night-lamp in the sick-room, and he heard the
                                 insistent baying of the hound.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10199">The moonlight was thick and full.  It showed the
                                 quiet hill flanked by the open pasture; and it showed
                                 the little whitewashed gaol, and the late roses
                                 blooming on the fence.  It showed also the mob that
                                 had
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10201"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="427" data-tei-n="440"> </a></span>
                                 gathered—a gathering as quiet as a congregation at
                                 prayer.  But in the silence was the danger—the
                                 determination to act that choked back speech—the
                                 grimness of the justice that walks at night—the
                                 triumph of a lawless rage that knows control.

                              <p id="d44710e10204">As he reached the hill he saw that the men he
                                 had followed had been enforced by others from
                                 different roads.  It was not an outbreak of swift
                                 desperation, but a well-planned, well-ordered
                                 strategy; it was not a mob that he faced, but an
                                 incarnate vengeance.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10208">He came upon it quickly, and as he did so he saw
                                 that the sheriff was ahead of him, standing, a single
                                 man, between his prisoner and the rope.  “For God's
                                 sake, men, I haven't got the keys,” he called out.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10211">Nicholas swung himself over the fence and made
                                 his way to the entrance beneath the steps that led to
                                 the floor above.  He had come as one of the men
                                 about him, and they had not heeded him.  Now, as
                                 he faced them from the shadow he saw here and
                                 there a familiar face—the face of a boy he had
                                 played with in childhood.  Several were masked, but
                                 the others raised bare features to the
                                 moonlight—features that were as familiar as his
                                 own.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10214">Then he stood up and spoke.  “Men, listen to me.
                                 In the name of the Law, I swear to you that justice
                                 shall be done—I swear.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10217">A voice came from somewhere.  “We ain't here
                                 to talk—you stand aside, and we'll show you what
                                 we're here for.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10220">Again he began.  “I swear to you  -”</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10223">“We don't want no swearing.”  On the outskirts
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10225"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="428" data-tei-n="441"> </a></span>
                                 of the crowd a man laughed.  “We don't want no
                                 swearing,” the voice repeated.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10229">The throng pressed forward, and he saw the
                                 faces that he knew crowding closer.  A black cloud
                                 shut out the moonlight.  Above the pleading of the
                                 sheriff's tones he heard the distant baying of the
                                 hound.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10232">He tried to speak again.  “We'll be damned, but
                                 we'll get the nigger!” called some one beside him.
                                 The words struck him like a blow.  He saw red, and
                                 the sudden rage upheld him.  He knew that he was
                                 to fight—a blind fight for he cared not what.  The old
                                 savage instinct blazed within him—the instinct to do
                                 battle to death—to throttle with his single hand the
                                 odds that opposed.  With a grip of iron he braced
                                 himself against the doorway, covering the entrance.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10235">“I'll be damned if you do!” he thundered.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10238">A quick shot rang out sharply.  The flash blinded
                                 him, and the smoke hung in his face.  Then the moon
                                 shone and he heard a cry—the cry of a well-known
                                 voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10241">“By God, it's Nick Burr!” it said.  He took a step
                                 forward.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10244">“Boys, I am Nick Burr,” he cried, and he went
                                 down in the arms of the mob.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10248">They raised him up, and he stood erect between
                                 the leaders.  There was blood on his lips, but a man
                                 tore off a mask and wiped it away.  “By God, it's
                                 Nick Burr!” he exclaimed as he did so.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10251">Nicholas recognised his voice and smiled.  His
                                 face was gray, but his eyes were shining, and as he
                                 steadied himself with all his strength, he said with
                                 <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d44710e10253"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="429" data-tei-n="442"> </a></span>
                                 a laugh.  “There's no harm done, man.”  But when
                                 they laid him down a moment later he was dead.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10256">He lay in the narrow path between the doorstep
                                 and the gate where roses bloomed.  Some one had
                                 started for the nearest house, but the crowd stood
                                 motionless about him.  “By God, it's Nick Burr!”
                                 repeated the man who had held him.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10259">The sheriff knelt on the ground and raised him in
                                 his arms.  As he folded his coat about him he looked
                                 up and spoke.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10262">“And he died for a damned brute,” was what he
                                 said.

                                 sat in her drawing-room with Sally Bassett.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10277">Outside there was the sound of tramping feet, for
                                 the people were giving him burial.  They had been
                                 passing so for half an hour and they still went on,
                                 on, on—he was going to his grave in state.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10280">“There are the drums,” said Sally, turning her ear.
                                 “All Virginia has come to town, I believe.  The
                                 whole city is in mourning, and by and by they will
                                 put up his statue in the Capitol Square—but if he
                                 had lived, would he have had the senatorship?”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10283">“Ah, who knows?” said Eugenia.  She played idly
                                 with the spoon of her teacup, her eyes on the coals.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10287">“As you say—who knows?” murmured the
                                 other.  “And, after all, it is perhaps better that he
                                 died just now.  He would have tried to lift us too
                                 high, and we should have fallen back.  He was a
                                 hero, and the public can't always keep to the heroic
                                 level.”
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10290">There were tears in her voice.</p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10293">Eugenia drank her tea and said nothing.</p>

                                 her hand before the fire.  Her child was rolling on
                                 the floor at her feet, but she did not stoop to him.
                                 She was not thinking—she was merely resting from
                                 emotion—as she would rest for the remainder of
                                 her days.

                                 passed once more, and along the block a boy went
                                 whistling a tune.  Everything was beginning again
                                 —everything would go on as it had gone since the
                                 dawn of time, and she would go with it. The best or
                                 the worst of it was that she would go happily—
                                 neither regretting nor despairing, but filled to the
                                 finger-tips with the cheerful energy of a busy life.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10305">Suddenly she caught up her child with a frantic
                                 rapture and held him to her bosom, kissing the small
                                 hands that reached up to her lips.  This was her
                                 portion, and even to-day she was content.

                                 he entered, and as he straightened himself against
                                 the mantel he looked down on her with an
                                 affectionate gaze.

                              <p id="d44710e10311">“He was a great man,” he said simply, and his
                                 generous spirit rang in his voice.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p id="d44710e10314">“Yes, he was a great man,” repeated Eugenia.
                                 She looked up at her husband as he stood before her
                                 —buoyant with expectation, mellowed by the glow
                                 of assured success.  He smiled into her face, and
                                 she smiled back again with quick tenderness.  Then
                                 she bent above her child and kissed his lips, and the
                                 sunlight coming from the day without shone in her
                                 eyes.
