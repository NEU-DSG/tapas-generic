                           Annual Exhibition of the Art Directors Club! After years of dickering with the New
                           York officials, Philadelphia has at last arranged for this, the most important annual
                           advertising show in the world, to be shown at the Art Alliance, 
                           <date id="d7956e193" when="--05-31">May 31</date> to

                        <p id="d7956e200">Comprising almost three hundred items from every field of advertising art, in all
                           media—oil, water color, etching, photography—this show will be a “must” not only for
                           the advertising man and the advertising student, but for everyone interested in contemporary
                           Americana.

                        <p id="d7956e203">Henry Pitz, who was largely responsible for the Show’s reaching Philadelphia, commented
                           on its importance by saying: “It should open the eyes of the ‘fine art’ people for
                           the simple reason that a lot of this is fine art, done by master craftsmen. It is
                           American folk art at its best, and as such, perhaps our most vital art form. Not only
                           has modern commercial art done much to popularize fine art movements, as seen by the
                           designs of Covarrubias, Alexander Brook, Grant Wood, or Cassandre, but it has also
                           stimulated in the average man a new appreciation of all art, since it is the most
                           widely influential of all contemporary art.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e206">So encouraging has been the response among commercial art circles to the Exhibition—the
                           Philadelphia Art Directors’ Club was re-united as an immediate result—that there is
                           now some possibility of making if an annual affair in Philadelphia.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e210">Two Philadelphians, Walter Reinsel and Paul Darrow, were honored with awards for distinctive
                           merit. To Reinsel went the award for the best design of a complete advertisement in
                           class magazines, while Darrow won the award for the best design for a complete advertisement
                           in newspapers.

                           Composition,” illustrating the composition he worked out by a flower painting done
                           later in the afternoon. Margaret Rebmann demonstrated artistic flower arrangements.
                           An exhibition and sale of arts and crafts, including garden sculpture by Clare Sorenson
                           Dieman, Dorothy Ford Montgomery, and Wharton Esherick, was carried on throughout the

                        <p id="d7956e254">George Grey Barnard, famous Pennsylvania born sculptor who died 
                           <date id="d7956e256" when="--04-24">April 24</date>, has left the bulk of his estate for the completion of his “Rainbow Arch”, a hundred
                           foot monument portraying the futility of war, on which he had been working for twenty
                           years. During his lifetime Barnard had tried to finance the arch through public subscription.
                           He refused offers of thousands of dollars from wealthy individuals, preferring to
                           have the monument paid for by the masses for whom he made it, with nickels and dimes.
                           His plaster model for the Arch now rests in an old power house in New York City and
                           was exhibited there in 1933.

                        <p id="d7956e294">“Isn’t it remarkable,” said Nicolas Marsicano, President of the Philadelphia Artists
                           Union, “that an organization of approximately one hundred members can put on an affair
                           of this magnitude? It has been tried without success in New York and other cities.”
                           And remarkable it was, with 2500 guests crowding the ball-room of the Penn A. C. on
                           the night of 
                           <date id="d7956e296" when="--05-07">May 7</date>, eagerly and vociferously watching the awarding of prizes for the best costumes.

                        <p id="d7956e300">The theme of the Artists Union ball was “Americana.” A “Casey at the Bat” costume
                           won first prize. Other awards went to “The Original Aztec,” a pulchritudinous maiden
                           attired in a huge feathered headdress and little else; an “Early American Couple”;
                           and “Kitty the Killer,” a new caricature of Katherine Littlefield by Lou Hirshman.
                           Miss Littlefield publicly slapped Hirshman for his last caricature for her. His reward
                           for this one was an original painting by A. Chanin. One of the most elaborate costumes,
                           though not a prize winner, was Paul Shearer’s effective “American Eagle.”

                        <p id="d7956e303">A pox on those tourists who attend costume balls in street or conventional evening
                           clothes, and on those who attend for the sole purpose of exhibiting the fact that
                           they are of indeterminate sex.

                           mirage containing a haloed cowboy and his heavenly gal friend.

                              so will they, for the most part, develop. It is naturally unnecessary to emphasize
                              the supreme importance of our educational system in strengthening the sinew of future
                              America—culturally and otherwise.

                           <p id="d7956e356">We seem to be making a good job of it—in all ways except one. That is the teaching
                              of art in public schools.

                           <p id="d7956e359">In this we have the most thoroughly pathetic system of education conceivable. Art,
                              as important as it is in the making of an intelligent and well balanced nation is,
                              in this connection, relegated to almost total obscurity. The Board of Public Education
                              would not consider granting a chair in chemistry to a professor who had but a smattering
                              of it, simply because he boasted ample teaching credits. However, that is precisely
                              what is often done in relation to teachers of art.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e363">By and large, art is dished out to public school pupils by individuals who have acquired
                              one or two fundamentals in drawing and precious little, or no, knowledge of the essence
                              of art—but are equipped with much useless psychology of teaching and what-not.

                           <p id="d7956e366">There is a gentleman of our acquaintance who, while possessed of a “talent” for drawing,
                              privately admits complete lack of knowledge of or sympathy for art. Nevertheless he
                              successfully completed one or two college courses which the Board of Public Education
                              deemed necessary to an art teacher—and which, incidentally, have nothing whatever
                              to do with art. Consequently, he is now qualified not only to teach art in the public
                              schools, but, by reason of superior academic credits to become a supervisor.

                              of our nation to become artists en masse, but only intelligent art teaching shall
                              create intelligent art response in the nation. And the artists shall suffer eventually,
                              with this system.

                              the fact that it is quite possible to find ARTISTS to teach art.

                              treated? Whereby each shall find it possible to work in harmony and to the eventual
                              profit of both?

                              practical and otherwise, that have been unsuccessfully launched.

                           <p id="d7956e388">We have discussed the rental charged to the artist by the gallery. Recently there
                              has been manifest an inclination on the part of the artist to charge rental to the
                              gallery. Both are sufficiently impractical, for neither can be paid with economic
                              logic, in most cases.

                           <p id="d7956e394">A novel is written and accepted for publication. The publisher bears the cost of printing,
                              advertising and distributing. The author is paid royalties from proceeds furnished
                              by the public’s purchase of the book WITHOUT FIRST HAVING READ IT. The royalties of
                              playwrights proceed from the same source—the public patronizes the theatre and cinema
                              WITHOUT FIRST HAVING SEEN WHAT IT PAID FOR. In the case of books borrowed from libraries,
                              they have, at any rate, been purchased by the libraries.

                           <p id="d7956e397">The only parallel situations in art are print-making, where possible duplication and
                              distribution makes royalties possible, and bronzes, which likewise may be duplicated
                              and approximate the situation.

                           <p id="d7956e401">But what about the painter, who cannot duplicate his originals? Royalties are unknown
                              to him. He paints and, having painted must in most cases pay for the privilege of
                              showing his wares to the public free of charge. If he sells, very well. If not, it
                              is unfortunate. Having sold, should the premium on his painting rise, its present
                              owner profits—not he, as he would were he a novelist. In other words, the painter’s
                              profit ends with his first successful audience.

                              amusement, of “Stella”. She was a “buxom, young, and scantily dressed siren” immortalized
                              in paint by one A. E. Hardy, of San Jose. It appears that during the 1915 Panama Pacific
                              Exposition one hundred thousand dollars in dimes was paid by the public for the delight
                              of eyeing her charms. Furthermore, she will come forth from her obscurity for the
                              same purpose at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition.

                           <p id="d7956e407">We do not regard this as an indication of American art-mindedness. It has occurred
                              to us, however, that a huge slice of American art lovers may find as great a thrill
                              in viewing an exhibition of contemporary American paintings as the patrons of “Stella”
                              enjoyed looking at her. They may pay, not only a dime, but a quarter.

                              no logical reason why an admission should not be charged. This plan has been adopted
                              by a few progressive galleries, and should be more widespread than it is, for without
                              the cooperation of all galleries the plan would be impotent. And equally impotent
                              if the artist does not share in it.

                              and those who understand them. While this view may be, at the moment, a bit too idealistic
                              for practical purposes, its virtue is well illustrated by certain isolated examples
                              in history. Michelangelo had his Lorenzo di Medici, Wagner his Mad King of Bavaria,
                              Van Gogh his Theo. Likewise, many another painter or composer has profited by the
                              sympathy of a layman.

                           <p id="d7956e420">Painting, that most incomprehensible of all arts, must have meant much to the late
                              Maurice Gangnat. He was a friend of Renoir and an active purchaser of his canvases.
                              From Philip, son of the collector, comes an assortment of fifty late Renoir oils to
                              abide indefinitely in the Philadelphia Museum, where, we have reason to hope, it may
                              be preserved from some future catastrophe of European war. Philip Gangnat has seen
                              to it that El Greco’s fate shall not be Renoir’s. For this we are largely indebted
                              to Henry P. Mcllhenny, assistant curator of the Museum, who was instrumental in having
                              the collection housed in Philadelphia where it is now on display, augmented by drawings,
                              lithographs, sculpture and oils from other sources.

                           <p id="d7956e426">One finds that with time Renoir’s vision tended to exclude purely textural and realistic
                              considerations; the texture of his canvas and the beauty of his pigment were his all,
                              and a glorious all they were. A tree, a rose, a strawberry, a bit of flesh—quite the
                              same to Renoir: food for his eye, mind and hand, the result more vital than its inspiration.

                              of oils, water colors and sculpture by Philadelphia artists. Unfortunately, the show

                              no one complexion was allowed to predominate—we were made to feel that Philadelphia
                              has a number of painters possessed of independence and originality of vision, who
                              do not tread upon each other’s toes, but progress side by side.

                              far away from Emlen Etting’s red house that peeked eerily from behind a bare tree.
                              Yet these artists have a common goal: that of fine paintings. Carl Lindborg, Albert
                              B. Serwazi, Grace Gemberling, Francis Speight and Virginia McCall are likewise moulding
                              their artistic destinies in courageous manner. Walter Baum continued to look upon
                              landscape with dramatic vigor. Antonio Martino saw the city with great strength and
                              simplicity, and Hobson Pittman contributed a soft, sympathetic interior.

                           <p id="d7956e468">That John James Audubon was a gifted artist as well as a great ornithologist is revealed
                              in the current exhibition of his work at the Academy of Natural Sciences. His feeling
                              for decorative line and mass was almost as strong as that for scientific accuracy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e471">“Carolina Parrot,” a water color and crayon showing a brilliant blue, yellow and orange
                              bird poised in a green vine, illustrates the artistic pattern that Audubon derived
                              concurrently with scientific exactitude. As in this piece, the natural habitat was
                              almost always made a decorative factor. Again, in “Trumpeter Swan,” one of the plates
                              from the original folio, the naturally pronounced curves of the bird and the dead
                              white of its plumage were made into a magnificent design.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e474">The group show at the A. C. A. Galleries, oils, water colors, and gouaches by seven
                              Philadelphians, provided variety and interest. In June Groff’s “Strings” the thick,
                              raw color has a soaring quality emulating the music of the violins and cello it portrays.
                              Philip Levone shows gouaches of a naive charm, “Fruit Cart,” vivid color areas bounded
                              in black, being typical. In the water color “Shubert Burlesque: Front Row,” Abe Chanin
                              catches the feverish closeness of the theatre; form, color and light are welded in
                              a shimmering movement. An affinity with cubism is revealed in the geometric shapes
                              that give Hubert Mesibov’s free water color, “Oil Refinery,” its pattern of force
                              and depth. Physical and spiritual weariness are interpreted by angular monotony and
                              grey-shot colors in Marsicano’s “Subway.” In “Old Woman,” Nat Koffman presents a study
                              in solidity. Joe Presser’s powerfully blocked out head, “Miner,” is, with its suggestion
                              of brooding strength, one of the most compelling pieces in the exhibition.

                           <p id="d7956e477">Created out of a love of the Radnor hunting country and the life it sponsors, the
                              paintings and drawings by Charles Morris Young, at McClees, record something of an
                              idyll in scenes of old taverns and farmhouses, and scarlet coated gentleman riding
                              the hounds over the sloping country of Pennsylvania. In spring and in fall, Young
                              depicts with sincerity the deep relationship between man and landscape.

                              are to be seen at the Carlen Galleries, achieves the utmost in decorative quality
                              from her method and her medium. In her work a feeling for complicated line is combined
                              with a keen appreciation of tonal values.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e484">Deep shadows and flaring lights, as in the pyramidal “Lantern and Fireplace” successfully
                              exploit the possibilities of the black and white print. In “Spring in the Garden,”
                              the twisting line embodies the movement of growth. Also included in this exhibit are
                              a series of her characteristically engaging cat studies.

                              the May exhibition at the Woman’s University Club. Slightly romantic in character,
                              these paintings successfully evoke the atmosphere of blue cragged Grecian harbors,
                              cathedrals in the Low Countries, and the low hills and peat fields of Ireland.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e490">“Rain’s End: County Donegal” is typical of Lucile Howard’s response to the Irish landscape.
                              A clearing, limitless sky stretches above blue mountains, while in the foreground
                              lie two thatched, stone cottages that seem to have risen out of the earth itself.
                              The real poverty of the country is transmuted. One senses not the barrenness of the
                              land, but its stillness and peace.
                           </p>

                              Club, are distinguished by bright, flat color thinly applied to gold or silver backgrounds.
                              Unconditionally decorative, these floral pieces are highly appealing within their
                              limited field. The fragile exoticism of the orchid, the scarlet flamboyancy of the
                              poppy—these are the sort of themes particularly suited to her technique.

                              Yet, difficult as the judging must have been, one feels satisfied with the Jury’s
                              decision to award Francis Speight the Sketch Club Medal for the strongly colored and
                              designed “Street in Pottsville”. Combining a free use of architectural and natural
                              forms with vivid and emotional color, Speight has constructed a powerful painting.

                              sullen tones and employing a telling repetition of the line of the railroad tracks
                              in the pattern of the sky, would likewise seem to merit the Honorable Mentions they

                              and mass. Page Carey’s emulation of the primitive, “Amish Evening,” is an amusing

                              have discarded a restricting consciousness of technique for a free creation of works

                        <p id="d7956e554">The Philadelphia Art News was born in the beginning of an exciting season in the art
                           activities of Philadelphia. This was the year of the Cezanne purchase, the Barnes
                           Battles, the Artists Union picketing of the Museum during the W.P.A. show, the Federal
                           Arts Bill controversy which gave rise to the formation of the most representative
                           art group in the town’s history—the Affiliated Art Heads of Philadelphia, and other
                           dramatic events.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e557">In the Philadelphia Art News, all of Philadelphia’s graphic and plastic art activities
                           have been impartially described for the first time—beginning with the Fine Arts through
                           Illustration, Commercial Art, Display, Architecture, Crafts, and Photography. Never
                           before has art been so effectively reported in relation to the everyday life of a
                           city. We have championed impartially all constructive art activities, and fearlessly
                           opposed undesirable practices. We have been independent of any organization or group
                           and have worked conscientiously for the common good of contemporary Philadelphia Art
                           and Artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e560">Your response has been encouraging. You have been friendly and cooperative and interested.
                           Yet a huge part of the potentialities for art appreciation and patronage in Philadelphia
                           is unawakened. It is absurd that this center of vast wealth should not be financially
                           an especially happy setting for able professional artists, but such is the case.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e563">The Philadelphia Art News is the likeliest means yet devised to correct this unfortunate
                           condition. Our plans for the fall are for a sounder structure and greater scope. We
                           count on you and all your friends to back us to the limit to help put over Philadelphia
                           art.

                        <p id="d7956e965">There was a time when America’s minor statesmen were painted by private portrait painters
                           on commission. Now W.P.A. offers to paint all public officials deemed worthy of representation
                           in oil. This constitutes another inroad of government-paid relief workers on private
                           enterprise W.P.A. has a distinguished record for the development and promotion of
                           talented painters who might have gone under forever in the depression, and this is
                           a fine thing. But every activity of W.P.A. which infringes on the narrow markets for
                           private commissions is a blow to the profession as a whole. Professional portrait
                           painters bitterly resent this new pinch to their currently slender chances of earning
                           a livelihood.

                        <p id="d7956e1029">A Philadelphia Muralist visited the office of a public official in New England. It
                           was a large room with many desks. Its long inner wall was informed with a mural purporting
                           to represent the life of a Revolutionary War General. The artist had let himself go,
                           esthetically. He had employed many known natural forms and colors and some unknown
                           ones. The hero of the piece—the Revolutionary General—had never been south of the
                           fortieth meridian. Nevertheless, in one panel the artist had introduced, under artistic
                           compulsion no doubt, palm trees and other tropical growths. Another space needed an
                           angular element to give it essence; this was ingeniously supplied by a certain view
                           of a cow.

                           it had been a W.P.A. project.

                           but I couldn’t arrange it. What do YOU think of it?”

                           and sculptor, died 
                           <date id="d7956e1062" when="--04-28">April 28</date>. In his memory we have reproduced “The Sprinter,” one of the figures of athletes
                           for which McKenzie was world-renowned. His first attempt at sculpture in the round,
                           “The Sprinter” was undertaken scientifically, using the average dimensions of successful
                           runners to represent the ideal average of the type, but it was an immediate artistic
                           success. It was completed in 1902 and shown that year at the Society of American Artists
                           Exhibition in New York, in 1903 at the Royal Academy, and in 1904 at the Paris Salon.

                           of those things that make life so miserable. Paramount Studios were quite taken with
                           an idea of Mike’s to make a full-length animated cartoon feature of Don Quixote. Key
                           drawings that he had prepared created quite a bit of interest in Hollywood, and it
                           looked as though “Mike’s” idea would be headed for the silver screen. Then came the
                           bitter pill. Paramount was relinquishing any desire to produce such a picture; they
                           took too long to make, several years at least, and cost too much. And besides, they
                           discovered that R.K.O. had a prior right to the story, and that they were distributors
                           for all of Walt Disney’s outfit, and that Walt was going to do the picture himself

                        <p id="d7956e1215">We dropped in on F. Sands Brunner last week, and got a good view of a big time illustrator
                           in his native haunts. Busy but willing to talk, he told us all about his work . .
                           . his start . . . his daughters . . . and a wooden horse standing in the middle of
                           the floor.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1218">He graduated from Industrial Art quite a while back (he forgets when), started out
                           doing advertising down at Curtis; Ladies Home Journal employed him for fifteen years.
                           During his decade and a half there, he sold them several covers, studied originals
                           of artists who were at the top of the heap, worked hard nights on his own stuff, and
                           emerged as a free lance poster artist and cover designer. Most recent work is a campaign
                           for Canada Dry; Iron City Beer takes a lot of his work, and the Valley Forge Beer
                           poster with the Washingtonish looking gentleman on it is a Brunner.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1221">His two daughters, Sybil and Janet, pose for him almost exclusively; both are very
                           pretty, intelligent, and embryonic artists themselves. Sybil attends Moore Institute;
                           Janet spends most of her time posing, when she isn’t out arching. Sybil, as a result
                           of the Christmas cover for “This Week,” for which she posed, was offered a screentest
                           by Paramount, turned it down on the grounds that she’d rather be an artist. More power
                           to Sybil.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1225">Aside from his work, Brunner’s main interest is archery. Mountain climbing runs a
                           close second, and every summer he packs the family off to the Adirondacks, turns them
                           loose, including himself, and works all over the landscape climbing things.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1228">The wooden horse we mentioned was built to hold a model to be used on a calendar painting.
                           Ever since, it’s stood there proudly, but inertly.

                           by heating White Lead at a high temperature. This pigment is permanent to light, but
                           sensitive, like all lead pigments, to certain sulfurous gases, and has practically
                           come into disuse. It was known in the time of Pliny, A. D. 677.

                           and was known to the early Egyptians. It is found native as a mineral and can be artificially
                           prepared. It is now almost obsolete, although once used extensively.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1276">There were also several organic lake pigments which were known even in the first century
                           A. D. Italian Pink and Dutch Pink, which are really yellow pigments, Yellow Madder,
                           and other Yellow Lakes prepared from extracts of the bark and berries of trees and
                           plants, such as Quercitron bark, Turkish, or Avignon berries, species of buckthorn,
                           dyers weed, etc. Since the development of synthetic dyestuffs, a larger selection
                           of far more permanent and brilliant Yellow Lakes has displaced these on the modern
                           palette.

                           was first mentioned by Cennino, 1437, as a natural earth of volcanic origin. Earlier
                           evidence of its use is found as an enamel and on decorated pottery.

                           unit we have used in Radnor’s Social science department in the last five years, the
                           Art department has made many valuable contributions. In the event we studied World
                           Culture units of any given chronological period or country, the Art instructor, Mr.
                           Martin, showed how the spirit of the times was portrayed in an artistic way, or how
                           the study of Art influenced that period of history.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1347">Art students in the social studies classes found many different outlets for their
                           abilities in doing project work. Oral reports, wood and soap carving, art themes,
                           portrait painting, cartoons, caricatures, sign and program printing, wood cuts, jewelry
                           making, and wood painting. All of these contributions served to enrich our program
                           and give the group a better appreciation of the subject under consideration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1350">The following are some concrete examples of units we have done and how the Art department
                           has been involved.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1353">THE SINO-JAPANESE WAR—After the students had been given a socio-political-economic
                           study in their class activities, Mr. Martin dwelt on Oriental art and the main differences
                           from Occidental art. With the assistance of Mr. Riley, a collector of ceramic pottery,
                           he gave a demonstration of this art in which the far east is unrivaled. The students
                           grasped the importance of art in the propaganda now being used by the Chinese and
                           Japanese which has played such an important role in moulding universal opinion. War
                           propaganda led to other types found in newspapers, magazines and billboards. These
                           in turn were discussed in the light of Art and we had many contributions from students
                           publicizing War, Peace, Labor, Capital, American legislation, etc. by cartoons, banners,
                           caricatures and slogans. Whenever political elections of any consequence are held,
                           the students enter the fray with all seriousness and burst forth with banners, portraits,
                           etc. in praise of or opposition to the candidates.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1356">RUSSIA—We made a study of 19th and 20th century Russia showing life under the old
                           regime and after the revolution.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1359">Mr. Martin, with his extensive background in Ecclesiastical Art, showed the influence
                           of the artists in the orthodox church. The students made a study of the Iconoclasts
                           and made several Icons as well as other symbols characteristic of the Russian church.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1362">CITY PLANNING AND THE F. H. A.—To the art department we gave the opportunity of laying
                           out a city, determining the architecture of houses conforming with the traditions
                           of that part of the country, drawing up plans for new housing to replace out-moded
                           buildings in slum areas, and doing it according to a low budget.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1366">VICTORIAN ENGLAND—Mr. Martin usually gives the trend of the various movements in art
                           in the 19th century from the Romanticists thru the Post-Impressionists. The students
                           read biographies on the masters of this period, draw sketches to illustrate the different
                           schools, and at the same time show how their thinking was affected by the times.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d7956e1369">These are just a few of the cooperative units where the art department is augmenting
                           our course of social studies. This policy has been adopted not only to give those
                           students interested in art an opportunity for project work, but also to develop a
                           sense of appreciation for art in all members of the group, and make them cognizant
                           of its importance and contribution to world movements and affairs.

                           (published by Covici Friede at $7.50) which atones for some of his too “popular” art
                           books. It is the diary of a nineteenth century Frenchman which is much more than a
                           record of his times. Here we find the man; his struggles; his hopes; his contempt
                           for those of his artistic contemporaries who, to his way of thinking, lost their artistic
                           integrity; and a humble realization of the inadequacy of his own work. He was an artist
                           who always remained a student.

                        <p id="d7956e1584">While he painted the then fashionable allegories almost exclusively, the work of Delacroix
                           rose far above the banalities of a Cabanel or a Bougereau. His own personality in
                           paint survived his prolonged studies of the old masters.

                           <p id="d7956e1627">Once I got into England without using the proper landing card, but that was just one
                              of those fantastic flukes. It was the time Irving Berlin and his bride escaped the
                              photographers and interviewers when they boarded the Leviathan at New York for their
                              honeymoon trip. Naturally all the news-hounds from Paris were on hand as the boat
                              reached Cherbourg, first port of call. Not knowing whether the famous couple would
                              disembark there or continue on to England we took no chances and boarded the Leviathan
                              at once. The Berlins didn’t land there so we stayed aboard and went along across the
                              Channel. The bridal pair stuck to their suite and their private deck and at first
                              resisted all our efforts to get interviews and pictures. The winning argument seemed
                              to be that they might as well get it over with now rather than dodge us all over Europe.
                              They consented then to come out on an upper deck for five minutes to be photographed.
                              Just as they came on deck the sun went down and a drizzle started. They shivered and
                              we got what pictures we could in about a minute, as they hurriedly returned to their
                              suite. Of course the sun, the old meanie, came out again as soon as they were gone.
                              As we neared the shores of Britain a boat came alongside and a bevy of derby-hatted
                              English photogs clambered up the side like monkeys, landing exactly, by luck or design,
                              on the newlyweds’ private deck, where their quarry were comfortably ensconced in deck
                              chairs enjoying the dazzling sunshine. Bang . . . bang . . . bang . . . and did they
                              get pictures! Beautiful, spontaneous, and unposed. Were our faces red?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e1630">When the ship docked we were given our landing cards and everything was in order,
                              but upon consulting railway schedules I found that if I waited for the usual landing
                              formalities I would miss the London-bound train, and this train just made connections
                              in London for the train for the channel boat. I had to catch that Channel boat to
                              get back to Paris in time to cover the races next day. The bederbied English cameramen
                              told me that it was all right just come along with them when they left ship and the
                              port authorities would think I was one of them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d7956e1633">“. . . but don’t open your mouth—your American accent would betray you,” they told
                              me. I kept it shut and made the train. I still have that landing card among my souvenirs.

                           portfolio should prove indispensable to the antiquarian. The material is almost exclusively
                           Pennsylvania-German. In addition to paintings of glassware, quilts and coverlets,
                           towels, plates, butter molds, cooking utensils, tiles and chests, there are dolls
                           dressed in the fashion of the time, and many fascinating toys.

                        <p id="d7956e1665">Aside from Pennsylvania-German material, the artists have created visual records of
                           old Philadelphia fire-fighting equipment. An exhibit of this work is planned in the
                           Fall.
