                              of a cage. “I
                              will get out,” he repeated, as his hansom took him swiftly from the house in Portman
                              Square,
                              where he had been dining, towards that other house in Carlton House Terrace, whither
                              his
                              thoughts had travelled on before him, outdistancing the Trip-Clip-Clop, Trip-Clip-Clop
                              of the

                           <p id="d75437e511">It was a hot night in June. Hugh had thrown back his overcoat, and the throng of passers-by
                              in
                              the street could see, if they cared to see, “the glass of fashion” in the shape of
                              white
                              waistcoat and shirt front, surmounted by the handsome, irritated face of their owner,
                              leaning
                              back with his hat tilted over his eyes.

                           <p id="d75437e518">A great deal of thinking may be compressed into a quarter of an hour, especially if
                              it has been
                              long eluded.

                           <p id="d75437e521">“I will get out,” he said again to himself with an impatient movement. It was beginning
                              to weary
                              him, this common-<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="3" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span> place intrigue which had been so new and
                              alluring a year ago. He did not own it to himself, but he was tired of it. Perhaps
                              the reason
                              why good resolutions have earned for themselves such an evil repute as paving stones
                              is because
                              they are often the result, not of repentance, but of the restlessness that dogs an
                              evaporating
                              pleasure. This 
                              <foreign id="d75437e525" xml:lang="fre">liaison</foreign> had been alternately his pride and his
                              shame for many months. But now it was becoming something more, which it had been all
                              the time,
                              only he had not noticed it till lately—a fetter, a clog, something irksome, to be
                              cast off and
                              pushed out of sight. Decidedly the moment for the good resolution had arrived.

                           <p id="d75437e529">“I will break it off,” he said again. “Thank heaven not a soul has ever guessed it.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e532">How could any one have guessed it?</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e535">He remembered the day when he had first met her a year ago, and had looked upon her
                              as merely a
                              pretty woman. He remembered other days, and the gradual building up between them of
                              a fairy
                              palace. He had added a stone here, she a stone there, until suddenly it became—a prison.
                              Had he
                              been tempter or tempted? He did not know. He did not care. He wanted only to be out
                              of it. His
                              better feelings and his conscience had been awakened by the first touch of weariness.
                              His brief
                              infatuation had run its course. His judgment had been whirled—he told himself it had
                              been
                              whirled, but it had really only been tweaked—from its centre, had performed its giddy
                              orbit, and
                              now the check-string had brought it back to the point from whence it had set out,
                              namely, that
                              she was merely a pretty woman.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e539">“I will break with her gradually,” he said, like the tyro he was, and he pictured
                              to himself the
                              wretched scenes in which she would abuse him, reproach him, probably compromise herself,
                              the
                              letters she would write to him. At any rate he need not read them. Oh! how tired he
                              was of the
                              whole thing beforehand. Why had he been such a fool? He looked at the termination
                              of the

                              How could any
                              one have guessed it? No breath of scandal had ever touched Lady Newhaven. She stood
                              beside her
                              pink orchids, near her fatigued-looking, gentle-mannered husband, a very pretty woman
                              in white
                              satin and diamonds. Perhaps her blonde hair was a shade darker at the roots than in
                              its waved
                              coils; perhaps her blue eyes did not look quite in harmony with their blue-black lashes;
                              but the
                              whole effect had the delicate conventional perfection of a cleverly touched-up
                              chromo-lithograph. Of course tastes differ. Some people like chromo-lithographs, others
                              don't.
                              But even those who do are apt to become estranged. They may inspire love, admiration,
                              but never
                              fidelity. Most of us have in our time hammered nails into our walls, which, though
                              they now
                              decorously support the engravings and etchings of our maturer years, were nevertheless
                              originally driven in to uphold the cherished, the long since discarded chromos of
                              our foolish
                              youth.

                              her, and she turned to offer the same small smile and gloved hand to the next comer,

                           <p id="d75437e574">Lord Newhaven darted forward.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e577">“Dick!” he exclaimed, and Dick shot forth an immense mahogany hand, and shook Lord
                              Newhaven's
                              warmly.

                           <p id="d75437e581">“Well,” he said, after Lord Newhaven had introduced him to his wife, “I'm dashed if
                              I knew who
                              either of you were. But I found your invitation at my club when I landed yesterday,
                              so I decided
                              to come and have a look at you. And so it is only you, Cackles, after all”—(Lord Newhaven's
                              habit of silence had earned for him the

                              “Cackles”)—“I quite thought I was going into—well, ahem!—into society. I did not know
                              you had
                              got a handle to your name. How did you find out I was in England?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e587">“My dear fellow, I didn't,” said Lord Newhaven, gently drawing Dick aside, whose back
                              was
                              serenely blocking a stream of new arrivals. “I fancy—in fact, I'm simply delighted
                              to see you.
                              How is the wine getting on? But I suppose there must be other Dick Vernons on my wife's
                              list.
                              Have you the card with you?”

                           <p id="d75437e590">“Rather,” said Dick, “always take the card with me since I was kicked out of a miner's
                              hop at
                              Broken Hill because I forgot it. ‘No gentleman will be admitted in a paper shirt’
                              was mentioned
                              on it, I remember. A concertina and candles in bottles. Ripping while it lasted. I
                              wish you had
                              been there.”

                           <p id="d75437e593">“I wish I had.” Lord Newhaven's tired, half-closed eye opened a little. “But the end
                              seems to
                              have been unfortunate.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e596">“Not at all,” said Dick, watching the new arrivals with his head thrown back. “Fine
                              girl that;
                              I'll take a look at the whole mob of them directly. They came round next day to say
                              it had been
                              a mistake, but there were four or five cripples who found that out the night before.
                              Here is the
                              card.”

                           <p id="d75437e602">Lord Newhaven glanced at it attentively, and then laughed.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e605">“It is four years old,” he said; “I must have put you on my mother's list, not knowing
                              you had
                              left London. It is in her writing.”

                           <p id="d75437e608">“I'm rather late,” said Dick composedly, “but I am here at last. Now, Cack—Newhaven,
                              if that's
                              your noble name—as I am here, trot out a few heiresses, would you? I want to take
                              one or two

                           <p id="d75437e614">“Thanks. I suppose, old chap, I'm all right? Not had on an evening-coat for four years.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e617">Dick's trousers were too short for him, and he had tied his white tie with a waist
                              to it. Lord
                              Newhaven had seen both details before he recognised him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e621">“Quite right,” he said hastily. “Now, who is to be the happy woman?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e624">Dick's hawk-eye promenaded over the crowd in the second room, in the doorway of which
                              he was
                              standing.

                              found himself in the doorway of the second. He had arrived late, and the rooms were
                              already

                              against the framed darkness, as she listened with evident amusement to the tall, ill-dressed
                              man
                              beside her.

                              She was
                              not beautiful except with the beauty of health, and a certain dignity of carriage
                              which is the
                              outcome of a head and hands and body that are at unity with each other, and with a

                              absolutely unconscious of self. She had not the long nose which so frequently usurps
                              more than
                              its share of the faces of the well bred, nor had she, alas! the short upper lip which
                              redeems
                              everything. Her features were as insignificant as her colouring. People rarely noticed
                              that
                              Rachel's hair was brown, and that her deep-set eyes were grey. But upon her grave
                              face the word
                              “Helper” was plainly written: and something else. What was it?

                              never beaten, there is an expression betokening strong resistance from within of the

                              whirlwind from without. The marks of conflict and endurance on a young face—who shall
                              see them
                              unmoved! The Mother of Jesus must have noticed a great difference in her Son when
                              she first saw
                              Him again after the temptation in the wilderness.

                           <p id="d75437e692">Rachel's grave amused glance fell upon Hugh. Their eyes met, and he instantly perceived
                              to his
                              astonishment that she recognised him. But she did not bow, and a moment later left
                              the nearly
                              empty rooms with the man who was talking to her.

                              cynical restless self which never remained in one stay. The half acknowledged weakness
                              in his
                              nature unconsciously flung itself upon her strength, a strength which had been tried.
                              She would
                              love him, and uphold him. There would be no more yielding to circumstances if that
                              pure strong
                              soul were close beside him. He would lean upon her, and the ugly bypaths of these
                              last years
                              would know him no more. Her presence would leaven his whole life. In the momentary
                              insanity,
                              which was perhaps after all only a prophetic intuition, he had no fears, no misgivings.

                              thought that with that face it was not possible that she could be so wicked as to
                              refuse
                              him.

                           <p id="d75437e701">“She will marry me,” he said to himself. “She must.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e705">Lady Newhaven touched him gently on the arm.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e708">“I dared not speak to you before,” she said. “Nearly every one has gone. Will you
                              take me down to
                              supper? I am tired out.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e711">He stared at her, not recognising her.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e714">“Have I vexed you?” she faltered.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e717">And with a sudden horrible revulsion of feeling he remembered. The poor chromo had
                              fallen
                              violently from its<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="8"> </a></span> nail. But the nail remained—ready. He took
                              her into the supper room and got her a glass of champagne. She subsided on to a sofa
                              beside
                              another woman, vaguely suspecting trouble in the air. He felt thankful that Rachel
                              had already
                              gone. Dick, nearly the last, was putting on his coat, arranging to meet Lord Newhaven
                              the
                              following morning at his club. They had been in Australia together, and were evidently
                              old
                              friends.

                           <p id="d75437e722">Lord Newhaven's listless manner returned as Dick marched out. Hugh had got one arm
                              in his coat.
                              An instinct of flight possessed him, a vague horror of the woman in diamonds furtively
                              watching
                              him under her lowered eyelids through the open door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e726">“Oh, Scarlett!” said Lord Newhaven, detaining him languidly, “I want three minutes
                              of your
                              valuable time. Come into my study.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e729">“Another crossbow for Westhope Abbey?” said Hugh, trying to speak unconcernedly, as
                              he followed
                              his host to a back room on the ground floor. Lord Newhaven was collecting arms for
                              the hall of
                              his country house.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e732">“No! much simpler than those elaborate machines,” said the older man, turning on the
                              electric
                              light. Hugh went in, and Lord Newhaven closed the door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e735">Over the mantel-shelf were hung a few old Japanese inlaid carbines, and beneath them
                              an array of
                              pistols.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e738">“Useless now,” said Lord Newhaven, touching them affectionately. “But,” he added,
                              with a shade
                              more listlessness than before, “Society has become accustomed to do without them,
                              and does ill
                              without them, but we must conform to her.” Hugh started slightly, and then remained
                              motionless.
                              “You observe these two paper lighters, Scarlett? One is an inch shorter than the other.
                              They
                              have been waiting on the mantel-shelf for the last month, till I had an opportunity
                              of drawing
                              your attention to them. I am sure we perfectly understand each other. No name need
                              be mentioned.
                              All scandal is avoided. I feel confident you will not hesitate to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span> make me the only reparation one man can make another in the somewhat hackneyed circumstances
                              in which we find ourselves.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e743">Lord Newhaven took the lighters out of the glass. He glanced suddenly at Hugh's stunned
                              face, and
                              went on:

                           <p id="d75437e747">“I am sorry the idea is not my own. I read it in a magazine. Though comparatively
                              modern it
                              promises soon to become as customary as the much to be regretted pistols for two and
                              coffee for
                              four. I hold the lighters thus, and you draw. Whoever draws or keeps the short one
                              is pledged to
                              leave this world within four months, or shall we say five, on account of the pheasant
                              shooting?
                              Five be it. Is it agreed? Just so! Will you draw?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e750">A swift spasm passed over Hugh's face, and a tiger glint leapt into Lord Newhaven's
                              eyes, fixed
                              intently upon him.

                           <p id="d75437e753">There was a brief second in which Hugh's mind wavered, as the flame of a candle wavers
                              in a
                              sudden draught. Lord Newhaven's eyes glittered. He advanced the lighters an inch nearer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e756">If he had not advanced them that inch Hugh thought afterwards that he would have refused
                              to
                              draw.

                           <p id="d75437e759">He backed against the mantel-piece, and then put out his hand suddenly and drew. It
                              seemed the
                              only way of escape.

                              Hugh, and lingered at the door of the study, she did not follow them with the deliberate
                              intention of eavesdropping, but from a vague impulse of suspicious anxiety. Yet she
                              crouched in
                              her white satin gown against the door listening intently.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e794">Neither man moved within. Only one spoke. There was no other sound to deaden her husband's
                              distinct low voice. The silence that followed his last word “Will you draw?” was broken
                              by his
                              laugh, and she had barely time to throw herself back from the door into a dark recess
                              under the
                              staircase before Hugh came out. He almost touched her as he passed. He must have seen
                              her if he
                              had been capable of seeing anything, but he went straight on unheeding. And as she
                              stole a few
                              steps to gaze after him, she saw him cross the hall and go out into the night without
                              his hat
                              and coat, the amazed servants staring after him.

                           <p id="d75437e798">She drew back to go upstairs, and met her husband coming slowly out of the study.
                              He looked
                              steadily at her, as she clung trembling to the banisters. There was no alteration
                              in his glance,
                              and she suddenly perceived that what he knew now he had always known. She put her
                              hand to her
                              head.

                           <p id="d75437e801">“You look tired,” he said, in the level voice to which she was accustomed. “You had
                              better go to
                              bed.”

                           <p id="d75437e804">She stumbled swiftly upstairs, catching at the banisters, and went into her own room.</p>

                              And she
                              remembered that she had given a party, and that she had on her diamonds.

                           <p id="d75437e812">It would take a long time to unfasten them. She pulled at the diamond sun on her breast
                              with a
                              shaking hand. Her husband had given it to her when her eldest son was born. Her maid
                              took the
                              tiara gently out of her hair, and cut the threads that sewed the diamonds on her breast
                              and
                              shoulders. Would it never end? The lace of her gown cautiously withdrawn through its
                              hundred
                              eyelet-holes knotted itself.

                           <p id="d75437e816">“Cut it,” she said impatiently. “Cut it.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e819">At last she was in her dressing-gown and alone. She flung herself face downwards on
                              the sofa. Her
                              attitude had the touch of artificiality which was natural to her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e822">The deluge had arrived, and unconsciously she met it as she would have made a heroine

                              believing herself to be a religious and virtuous person. She was so accustomed to

                              it had become a habit, and now the whole of her self-respect was in one wrench torn
                              from her.
                              The events of the last year had not worn it down to its last shred, had not even worn

                              affections and interests of which they had not spoken she described them as “cunning.”

                              already far advanced. A hot day had succeeded to a hot night. For a few seconds he
                              lay like one
                              emerging from the influence of morphia, who feels his racked body still painlessly
                              afloat on a
                              sea of rest, but is conscious that it is drifting back to the bitter shores of pain,
                              and who
                              stirs neither hand nor foot for fear of hastening the touch of the encircling aching
                              sands on
                              which he is so soon to be cast in agony once more.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e974">His mind cleared a little. Rachel's grave face stood out against a dark background—a
                              background
                              darker surely than that of the summer night. He remembered with self-contempt the
                              extravagant
                              emotion which she had aroused in him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e978">“Absurd,” Hugh said to himself, with the distrust of all sudden springs of pure emotion
                              which
                              those who have misused them rarely escape. And then another remembrance, which only
                              a sleeping
                              draught had kept at bay, darted upon him like a panther on its prey.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e981">He had drawn the short lighter.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e984">He started violently, and then fell back trembling.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e987">“Oh, my God!” he said involuntarily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e990">He lay still, telling himself that this dreadful nightmare would pass, would fade
                              in the light of
                              common day.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e993">His servant came in noiselessly with a cup of coffee and a little sheaf of letters.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e999">He pretended to be asleep; but when the man had gone he put out his shaking hand for
                              the coffee
                              and drank it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1002">The mist before his mind gradually lifted. Gradually, too, the horror on his face
                              whitened to
                              despair, as a twilight meadow whitens beneath the evening frost. He had drawn the
                              short lighter.
                              Nothing in heaven or earth could alter that fact.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1005">He did not stop to wonder how Lord Newhaven had become aware of his own dishonour,
                              or at the
                              strange weapon with which he had avenged himself. He went over every detail of his
                              encounter
                              with him in the study. His hand had been forced. He had been thrust into a vile position.
                              He
                              ought to have refused to draw. He did not agree to draw. Nevertheless he had drawn.
                              And Hugh
                              knew that if it had to be done again, he should again have been compelled to draw
                              by the iron
                              will before which his was as straw. He could not have met the scorn of those terrible
                              half-closed eyes if he had refused.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1008">“There was no help for it,” said Hugh, half aloud. And yet to die by his own hand
                              within five
                              months! It was incredible. It was preposterous.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1011">“I never agreed to it,” he said, passionately.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1015">
                              <emph id="d75437e1016">Nevertheless he had drawn</emph>. The remembrance ever returned to lay its cold hand upon
                              his heart, and with it came the grim conviction that if Lord Newhaven had drawn the
                              short
                              lighter he would have carried out the agreement to the letter. Whether it was extravagant,
                              unchristian, whatever might have been truly said of that unholy compact, Lord Newhaven
                              would
                              have stood by it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1020">“I suppose I must stand by it, too,” said Hugh to himself, the cold sweat breaking
                              on his
                              forehead. “I suppose I am bound in honour to stand by it, too.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1023">He suffered his mind to regard the alternative.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1026">To wrong a man as deeply as he had wronged Lord Newhaven; to tacitly accept.—That
                              was where his
                              mistake had been. Another man, that mahogany-faced fellow with the colonial<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="17"> </a></span> accent, would have refused to draw, and would have knocked Lord
                              Newhaven down and half killed him, or would have been knocked down and half killed
                              by him. But
                              to tacitly accept a means by which the injured man risked his life to avenge his honour,
                              and
                              then afterwards to shirk the fate which a perfectly even chance had thrown upon him
                              instead of
                              on his antagonist! It was too mean, too despicable. Hugh's pale cheek burned.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1031">“I am bound,” he said slowly to himself over and over again. There was no way of escape.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1034">Yesterday evening, with some intuition of coming peril, he had said “I will get out.”
                              The way of
                              retreat had been open behind him. Now by one slight movement he was cut off from it
                              for
                              ever.

                           <p id="d75437e1038">“I can't get out,” said the starling, the feathers on its breast worn away with beating
                              against
                              the bars.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1041">“I can't get out,” said Hugh, coming for the first time in contact with the bars which
                              he was to
                              know so well, the bars of the prison that he had made with his own hands.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1044">He looked into the future with blank eyes. He had no future now. He stared vacantly
                              in front of
                              him like a man who looks through his window at the wide expanse of meadow and waving
                              wood and
                              distant hill which has met his eye every morning of his life, and finds it—gone. It
                              was
                              incredible. He turned giddy. His reeling mind, shrinking back from the abyss, struck
                              against a
                              fixed point, and clutching it came violently to a standstill.

                           <p id="d75437e1053">His mother was a widow and he was her only son. If he died by his own hand it would
                              break her
                              heart. Hugh groaned and thrust the thought from him. It was too sharp. He could not
                              stifle
                              it.

                              He
                              admitted it, but this monstrous judgment on him was out of all proportion to his offence.
                              And
                              like some malignant infectious disease<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span> retribution would fall,
                              not on him alone, but on those nearest him, on his innocent mother and sister. It
                              was unjust,
                              unjust, unjust.

                           <p id="d75437e1062">A very bitter look came into his face. Hugh had never so far hated any one, but now
                              something
                              very like hatred welled up in his heart against Lady Newhaven. She had lured him to
                              his
                              destruction. She had tempted him. This was undoubtedly true, though not probably the
                              view which
                              her guardian angel would take of the matter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1065">Among the letters which the servant had brought him he suddenly recognised that the
                              topmost was
                              in Lady Newhaven's handwriting. Anger and repulsion seized him. No doubt it was the
                              first of a
                              series. “Why was he so altered? What had she done to offend him?” &amp;c. &amp;c. He knew
                              the
                              contents beforehand, or thought he knew them. He got up deliberately, threw the unopened
                              note
                              into the empty fireplace, and put a match to it. He watched it burn.

                           <p id="d75437e1068">It was his first overt act of rebellion against her yoke, the first step along the

                              many well-worn paths that a man takes at random to leave a woman. It did not occur
                              to him that
                              Lady Newhaven might have written to him about his encounter with her husband. He knew
                              Lord
                              Newhaven well enough to be absolutely certain that he would mention the subject to
                              no living
                              creature, least of all to his wife.

                           <p id="d75437e1077">Hugh was a man of many social engagements. His first impulse, when later in the day
                              he remembered
                              them, was to throw them all up and leave London. But Lord Newhaven would hear of his
                              departure,
                              and would smile. He decided to remain and to go on as if nothing had happened. When
                              the evening
                              came he dressed with his usual care, verified the hour of his engagement, and went
                              out to dine
                              with the Loftuses.

                              with Mr. Doll Loftus. After a very brief sojourn in that city of frivolity she had
                              the acumen to
                              discover that London society was hopelessly worldly and mercenary, that people only
                              met to eat
                              and to abuse each other, that the law of cutlet for cutlet was universal, that young
                              men,
                              especially those in the Guards, were garrisoned by a full complement of devils, that
                              London
                              girls lived only for dress and the excitement of husband-hunting. In short, to use
                              her own
                              expression, she “turned London society inside out.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1113">London bore the process with equanimity, and presently Sybell determined to raise
                              the art of
                              dinner-giving from the low estate to which she avowed it had fallen to a higher level.
                              She was
                              young, she was pretty, she was well born, she was rich. All the social doors were
                              open to her.
                              But one discovery is often only the prelude to another. She soon made the further
                              one that in
                              order to raise the tone of social gatherings it is absolutely necessary to infuse
                              into them a
                              leaven of “clever people.” Further light on this interesting subject showed her that
                              most of the
                              really “clever people” did not belong to her set. The discovery which all who love
                              adulation
                              quickly make—namely, that the truly appreciative and sympathetic and gifted are for
                              the greater
                              part to be found in a class below their own—was duly made and registered by Sybell.
                              She avowed
                              that class differences were nothing to her with the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span> enthusiasm
                              of all those who since the world began have preferred to be first in the society which
                              they
                              gather round them.

                           <p id="d75437e1119">Fortunately for Sybell she was not troubled by doubts respecting the clearness of
                              her own
                              judgment. Eccentricity was in her eyes originality; a wholesale contradiction of established
                              facts was a new view. She had not the horrid perception of difference between the
                              real and the
                              imitation which spoils the lives of many. She was equally delighted with both, and
                              remained in
                              blissful ignorance of the fact that her “deep” conversation was felt to be exhaustingly
                              superficial if by chance she came across the real artist or thinker instead of his
                              counterfeit.

                              virulent developments; the “new woman” with stupendous lopsided opinions on difficult
                              Old
                              Testament subjects; the “lady authoress” with a mission to show up the vices of a
                              society which
                              she knew only by hearsay. Hither came unwittingly simple-minded Church dignitaries,
                              who, Sybell
                              hoped, might influence for his good the young agnostic poet who had written a sonnet
                              on her
                              muff-chain, a very daring sonnet, which Doll, who did not care for poetry, had not
                              been shown.
                              Hither, by mistake, thinking it was an ordinary dinner-party, came Hugh, whom Sybell
                              said she
                              had discovered, and who was not aware that he was in need of discovery. And hither
                              also on this
                              particular evening came Rachel West, whom Sybell had pronounced to be very intelligent
                              a few
                              days before, and who was serenely unconscious that she was present on her probation,
                              and that if
                              she did not say something striking she would never be asked again.

                           <p id="d75437e1128">Doll Loftus, Sybell's husband, was standing by Rachel when Hugh came in. He felt drawn
                              towards
                              her because she was not “clever” as far as her appearance went. At any rate, she had
                              not the
                              touzled, ill-groomed hair which he had learned to associate with female genius.

                              calling forth
                              admiring laughter. “I don't understand half they say, and when I do I sometimes wish

                              you
                              mean?”

                           <p id="d75437e1139">“There is Scarlett,” said Doll with relief, who hated definitions, and felt the conversation
                              was
                              on the slippery verge of becoming deep. “Do you know him? Looks as if he'd seen a

                           <p id="d75437e1143">Rachel's interest, never a heavy sleeper, was instantly awakened as she saw Sybell
                              piloting Hugh
                              towards her. She recognised him—the man she had seen last night in the hansom and
                              afterwards at
                              the Newhavens. A glance showed her that his trouble, whatever it might be, had pierced
                              beyond
                              the surface feelings of anger and impatience, and had reached the quick of his heart.
                              The young
                              man, pallid and heavy-eyed, bore himself well, and Rachel respected him for his quiet
                              demeanour
                              and a certain dignity, which, for the moment, obliterated the slight indecision of
                              his face, and
                              gave his mouth the firmness which it lacked. It seemed to Rachel as if he had but
                              now stood by a
                              deathbed, and had brought with him into the crowded room the shadow of an inexorable
                              fate.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1146">The others only perceived that he had a headache. Hugh did not deny it. He complained
                              of the
                              great heat to Sybell, but not to Rachel. Something in her clear eyes told him, as
                              they told many
                              others, that small lies and petty deceits might be laid aside with impunity in dealing
                              with her.
                              He felt no surprise at seeing her, no return of the sudden violent emotion of the
                              night before.
                              He had never spoken to her till this moment, but yet he felt that her eyes were old
                              friends,
                              tried to the uttermost and found faithful in some forgotten past. Rachel's eyes had
                              a certain
                              calm fixity in them that comes not of natural temperament but of past conflict, long
                              waged, and
                              barely but irrevocably won. A faint ray of comfort stole<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span> across
                              the desolation of his mind as he looked at her. He did not notice whether she was
                              handsome or
                              ugly, any more than we do when we look at the dear familiar faces which were with
                              us in their

                              words, but after a faint attempt at conversation he found that he had relapsed into
                              silence, and
                              that it was she who was talking. Presently the heavy cloud upon his brain lifted.

                              face relaxed. She glanced at him, and continued her little monologue. Her face had

                              dwelt
                              only in the curves of her small ears.

                              and who has
                              heard the stifled sigh of a vast perishing humanity.”

                              for I was one of them, and earned my bread among them. Miss Gresley's book may not
                              be palatable
                              in some respects, the district visitor and the woman missionary are certainly treated
                              with
                              harshness, but as far as my experience goes, the ‘Idyll’ is a true word from first

                           <p id="d75437e1304">There was in Rachel's voice a restrained force that vaguely stirred all the occupants
                              of the
                              room. Every one looked at her, and for a moment no one spoke. She became quite colourless.

                              “If it will only go on for a week without stopping there may be some hope for the

                           <p id="d75437e1314">The conversation buzzed up again, and Rachel turned instantly to Hugh, before Mr.

                              forward with his ring, had time to address her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1317">Hugh alone saw what a superhuman effort it had been to her to overcome her shrinking
                              from
                              mentioning, not her previous poverty, but her personal experience. She had sacrificed
                              her
                              natural reserve, which he could see was great; she had even set good taste at defiance
                              to defend
                              Hester Gresley's book. Hugh had shuddered as he heard her speak. He felt that he could
                              not have
                              obtruded himself on so mixed an assembly. Yet he saw that it had cost her more to
                              do so than it
                              would have cost him.

                           <p id="d75437e1320">He began to remember having heard people speak of an ironmaster's daughter, whose
                              father had
                              failed and died, and who, after several years of dire poverty, had lately inherited
                              a vast
                              fortune from her father's partner. It had<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span> been talked about at
                              the time, a few months ago. This must be she.

                           <p id="d75437e1325">“You have a great affection for Miss Gresley,” he said in a low voice.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1328">“I have,” said Rachel, her lip still quivering. “But if I disliked her I hope I should
                              have said
                              the same. Surely it is not necessary to love the writer in order to defend the book.”

                           <p id="d75437e1331">Hugh was silent. He looked at her, and wished that she might always be on his side.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1335">“About two courses ago I was going to tell you,” said Rachael smiling, “of one of
                              my chief
                              difficulties on my return to the civilised world and ‘Society.’ But now you have had
                              an example
                              of it. I am trying to cure myself of the trick of becoming interested in conversation.
                              I must
                              learn to use words as counters, not as coins. I need not disbelieve what I say, but
                              I must not
                              speak of anything to which I attach value. I perceive that to do this is an art and
                              a means of
                              defence from invasion. But I, on the contrary, become interested, as you have just
                              seen. I
                              forget that I am only playing a game, and I rush into a subject like a bull into a
                              china shop,
                              and knock about all the crockery until—as I am not opposed by my native pitchfork—I
                              suddenly
                              return to my senses, and discover that I have mistaken a game for real earnest.”

                           <p id="d75437e1338">“We were all in earnest five minutes ago,” said Hugh, “at least, I was. I could not
                              bear to hear
                              Miss Gresley patronised by all these failures and amateurs. But unless I am very much
                              mistaken
                              you will find several pitchforks laid up for you in the drawing-room.”

                           <p id="d75437e1341">“I don't mean to smash any more china,” said Rachel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1344">Another wavelet skimmed in and broke a little further up the sand. A sense of freshness,
                              of
                              expectation was in the air. The great gathered ocean was stirring itself in the distance.
                              Hugh
                              had forgotten his trouble.

                           <p id="d75437e1347">He turned the conversation back to Hester Gresley and her writing. He spoke of her
                              with sympathy

                              eyes which made him jealous of Hester.

                           <p id="d75437e1352">By the time the evening was over the imperceptible travelling of the summer sea had
                              reached as

                              darkness and
                              the rain. At the door with them the horror and despair of the morning were in wait
                              for him, and
                              laid hold upon him. Hugh shuddered, and turned instinctively to Rachel.

                              desolation.

                           <p id="d75437e1365">A long look passed between them. Hugh's tortured soul full of passionate entreaty

                              eyes. Hers, sad and steadfast, met the appeal in his, and recognised it as a claim.
                              There was no
                              surprise in her quiet face.

                              till they do
                              come. And if they don't come the hastily improvised friendship may hold together for
                              years, like
                              an unseaworthy boat in a harbour, which looks like a boat but never goes out to sea.

                           <p id="d75437e1409">But nevertheless here and there among its numberless counterfeits a friendship rises
                              up between
                              two women which sustains the life of both, which is still young when life is waning,
                              which man's
                              love and motherhood cannot displace nor death annihilate; a friendship which is not
                              the solitary
                              affection of an empty heart nor the deepest affection of a full one, but which nevertheless
                              lightens the burdens of this world and lays its pure hand upon the next.

                           <p id="d75437e1413">Such a friendship, very deep, very tender, existed between Rachel West and Hester
                              Gresley. It
                              dated back from the nursery days, when Hester and Rachel solemnly eyed each other,
                              and then made
                              acquaintance in the dark gardens of Portman Square, into which Hester introduced a
                              fortified
                              castle with a captive princess in it and a rescuing prince and a dragon, and several
                              other
                              ingredients of romance, to the awed amazement of Rachel—stolid, solid, silent Rachel—who
                              loved
                              all two- and four-legged creatures, but who never made<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span> them
                              talk to each other as Hester did. And Hester, in blue serge, told Rachel, in crimson
                              velvet, as
                              they walked hand in hand in front of their nursery-maids, what the London sparrows
                              said to each
                              other in the gutters, and how they considered the gravel-path in the square was a
                              deep river
                              suitable to bathe in. And when the spring was coming, and the prince had rescued the
                              princess so
                              often from the dungeon in the laurel-bushes that Hester was tired of it, she told
                              Rachel how the
                              elms were always sighing because they were shut up in town, and how they went out
                              every night
                              with their roots into the green country to see their friends, and came back oh! so
                              early in the
                              morning, before any one was awake to miss them. And Rachel's heart yearned after Hester,
                              and she
                              gave her her red horse and the tin duck and magnet, and Hester made stories about
                              them all.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1418">At last the day came when Rachel's mother, who had long viewed the intimacy with complacency,
                              presented her compliments, in a note-sheet with two immense gilt crests on it, to
                              Hester's aunt,
                              and requested that her little niece might be allowed to come to tea with her little
                              daughter.
                              And Lady Susan Gresley, who had never met the rich ironmaster's wife in this world,
                              and would
                              probably be equally exclusive in the next, was about to refuse, when Hester, who up
                              to that
                              moment had apparently taken no interest in the matter, suddenly cast herself on the
                              floor in a
                              paroxysm of despair and beat her head against the carpet. The tearful entreaties of
                              her aunt
                              gradually elicited the explanation, riddled by sobs, that Hester could never take
                              an interest in
                              life again, could never raise herself even to a sitting position, nor dry her eyes
                              on her aunt's
                              handkerchief, unless she were allowed to go to tea with Rachel and see her dormouse.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1421">Lady Susan, much upset herself, and convinced that these outbursts were prejudicial
                              to Hester's
                              health, gave way at once, and a few days later Hester, pale, shy, in a white muffler,
                              escorted
                              by Mademoiselle, went to tea in the magnificent house on the other side of the square,
                              and saw
                              Rachel's<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="31"> </a></span> round head without a feathered hat on it, and both
                              children were consumed by shyness until the two Mademoiselles withdrew into another
                              room, and
                              Rachel showed Hester the dormouse which she had found in the woods in the country,
                              and which ate
                              out of her hand. And Hester made a little poem on it, beginning: <q style=" display: block; ">
                                 
                                 <l id="d75437e1427">There was a mouse in Portman Square.</l>
                                 </q> And so, with many breaks, the friendship attained a surer footing, and the intimacy
                              grew
                              with their growth, in spite of the fact that Lady Susan had felt unable (notwithstanding
                              the
                              marked advances of Mrs. West, possibly because of them) to enlarge her visiting list,
                              in spite
                              of many other difficulties which were only in the end surmounted by the simplicity
                              of character
                              which Rachel had not inherited from her parents.

                           <p id="d75437e1432">And then, after both girls had danced through one London season in different ball-rooms,
                              Rachel's
                              parents died, her mother first, and then—by accident—her father, leaving behind him
                              an avalanche
                              of unsuspected money difficulties, in which even his vast fortune was engulphed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1435">Hard years followed for Rachel. She ate the bread of carefulness in the houses of
                              poor relations
                              not of high degree, with whom her parents had quarrelled when they had made their
                              money and
                              began to entertain social ambitions. She learned what it was to be the person of least
                              importance in families of no importance. She essayed to teach and failed. She had
                              no real
                              education. She made desperate struggles for independence, and learned how others failed
                              besides
                              herself. She left her relations and their bitter bread and came to London, and struggled
                              with
                              those who struggled, and saw how Temptation spreads her net for bleeding feet. Because
                              she loved
                              Hester she accepted from her half her slender pin-money. Hester had said, “If I were
                              poor,
                              Rachel, how would you bear it if I would not let you help me?” And Rachel had wept
                              slow
                              difficult tears, and had given Hester the comfort of helping<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="33" data-tei-n="32"> </a></span>
                              her. The greater generosity was with Rachel, and Hester knew it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1440">And as Rachel's fortunes sank, Hester's rose. Lady Susan Gresley had one talent, and
                              she did not
                              lay it up in a napkin. She had the art of attracting people to her house, that house
                              to which
                              Mrs. West had never forced an entrance. Hester was thrown from the first into a society
                              which
                              her clergyman brother, who had never seen it, pronounced to be frivolous, worldly,
                              profane, but
                              which no one has called dull. There were many facets in Hester's character, and Lady
                              Susan had
                              managed to place her where they caught the light. Was she witty? Was she attractive?
                              Who shall
                              say. Man is wisely averse to “cleverness” in a woman, but if he possesses any armour
                              wherewith
                              to steel himself against wit it is certain that he seldom puts it on. She refused
                              several
                              offers, one so brilliant that no woman ever believed that it was really made.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e1444">Lady Susan saw that her niece, without a fortune, with little beauty save that of
                              high breeding,
                              with weak health, was becoming a personage. “What will she become?” people said. And
                              in the
                              meanwhile Hester did nothing beyond dressing extremely well. And everything she saw
                              and every
                              person she met added fuel to an unlit fire in her soul.

                              contrast with those when despair and failure had confronted her, she lived by the

                              hands among those poor as herself. Gradually she had lost sight of all her acquaintances.
                              She
                              had been out of the schoolroom for too short a time to make friends. And alas! in
                              the set in
                              which she had been launched poverty was a crime; no, perhaps not quite that, but as
                              much a bar
                              to intercourse as in another class a want of the letter H is found to be.

                              acquainted in the short year of her social life before the collapse of her fortunes.
                              He had paid
                              her considerable attention, and she had thought once or twice with momentary bitterness
                              that,
                              like the rest, he had not cared to find out what had become of her. She greeted him
                              with shy but
                              evident pleasure. She took for granted he had come to see her, and he allowed her
                              to remain
                              under that delusion. In reality he had been hunting up an old model whom he wanted
                              for his next
                              picture, and who had silently left Museum Buildings some months before without leaving
                              his
                              address. He had genuinely admired her though he had forgotten her, and he was unaffectedly

                           <p id="d75437e1458">That one chance meeting was the first of many. Flowers came to Rachel's little room,
                              and romance
                              came with them. Rachel's proud tender heart struggled and then gave way before this

                              first love blossoming in the midst of her loneliness. At last on a March afternoon
                              when the low
                              sun caught the daffodils he had brought her he told her he loved her.

                              life may
                              bring. That year the spring came early, and they went often together into the country.
                              And that
                              year when all the world was white with blossom the snow came, and laid upon earth's
                              bridal veil
                              a white shroud. Every cup of May blossom, every petal of hawthorn bent beneath its
                              burden of
                              snow. And so it was in the full springtide of Rachel's heart. The snow came down upon
                              it. She
                              discovered at last that though he loved her he did not wish to marry her; that even
                              from the
                              time of that first meeting he had never intended to marry her. That discovery was
                              a shroud. She
                              wrapped her dead love in it, and would fain have buried it out of her sight.

                              returned and returned, but which at last after one dreadful day was seen no more in
                              Museum
                              Buildings. Rachel had laid the ghost at last. But the conflict remained graven in
                              her face.

                              to the
                              untidy entrance of Museum Buildings where Rachel still lived. It was a miserable day.
                              The
                              streets and bare trees looked as if they had been drawn in in ink, and the whole carelessly
                              blotted before it was dry. All the outlines were confused, blurred. The cold penetrated
                              to the
                              very bones of the shivering city.

                              transcribed.
                              A woman waiting for her on the endless stone stairs had cursed her for taking the

                              climbing the stairs.

                              man who paid her for the work by which she could barely live, fell like lead into
                              Rachel's
                              heart. She looked out dumbly over the wilderness of roofs. The suffering of the world
                              was eating
                              into her soul, the suffering of this vast travailing East London, where people trod
                              each other
                              down to live.

                              flesh and
                              blood of my fellow creatures, that my virtue and ease and pleasure were bought by
                              their
                              degradation, and toil and pain, I should not have believed it, and I should have been
                              angry. If
                              I had been told that the clothes I wore, the food I ate, the pen I wrote with, the
                              ink I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="36" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span> used, the paper I wrote on—all these, and everything I
                              touched, from my soap to my matchbox, especially my matchbox, was the result of sweated
                              labour,
                              I should not have believed it, I should have laughed. But yet it is so. If I had not
                              been rich
                              once myself I should think as all these people do, that the rich are devils incarnate
                              to let
                              such things go on. They have the power to help us. We have none to help ourselves.
                              But they
                              never use it. The rich grind the poor for their luxuries with their eyes shut, and
                              we grind each
                              other for our daily bread with our eyes open. I have got that woman's work. I have
                              struggled
                              hard enough to get it, but though I did not realise it, I might have known that I
                              had only got
                              on to the raft by pushing some one else off it.”

                           <p id="d75437e1494">Rachel looked out across the miles of roofs which lay below her garret window. The
                              sound was in
                              her ears of that great whirlpool wherein youth and beauty and innocence go down quick
                              day by
                              day. The wilderness of leaden roofs turned suddenly before her eyes into a sullen
                              furrowed sea
                              of shame and crime which, awaiting no future day of judgment, daily gave up its awful
                              dead.

                           <p id="d75437e1497">Presently Hester came in, panting a little after the long ascent of worn stairs, and
                              dragging
                              with her a large parcel. It was a fur-lined cloak. Hester spread it mutely before
                              her friend,
                              and looked beseechingly at her. Then she kissed her, and the two girls clung together
                              for a
                              moment in silence.

                           <p id="d75437e1500">“Dearest,” said Rachel, “don't give me new things. It isn't that—you know I did take
                              it when I
                              was in need. But oh, Hester, I know you can't afford it. I should not mind if you
                              were rich, at
                              least, I would try not, but—if you would only give me some of your old clothes instead.
                              I should
                              like them all the better because you had worn them.” And Rachel kissed the lapel of

                              coat.

                              deliciously warm, and—do look; it has two little pockets in the fur lining.”

                              lived the unprotected life, and showed it in her bearing. The other had lived the

                              just the same as my new one, lined with chinchilla, but I knew it would only make

                              I wish,” looking vindictively at the cloak, “I wish rabbits had never been born.”

                              white exhausted face to her friend. “He said that we are always so placed that we

                              And those
                              are the things”—Rachel's voice shook—“which you have always given me, and which I
                              can't do
                              without. You feel my poverty more than I do myself. It crushed me at first when I
                              could not
                              support myself. Now that I can—and in everything except money I am very rich—I am
                              comparatively
                              happy.”

                           <p id="d75437e1561">“Perhaps,” said Rachel at last with difficulty, “if I had remained an heiress Mr.
                              Tristram might
                              have married me. I feel nearly sure he would have married me. In that case I lost
                              my money only
                              just in time to prevent a much greater misfortune, and I am glad I am as I am.”

                              lit up
                              something which had long lain colossal but inapprehended in the depths of her mind.
                              Her paroxysm
                              of despair at her own powerlessness was followed by a lightning flash of self-revelation.
                              She
                              saw, as in a dream, terrible, beautiful, inaccessible, but distinct, where her power
                              lay, of
                              which restless bewildering hints had so often mocked her. She had but to touch the
                              houses and
                              they would fall down. She held her hands tightly together lest she should do it. The
                              strength as
                              of an infinite ocean swept in beneath her weakness, and bore it upon its surface like
                              a
                              leaf.

                              open her own cheap patent padlock with a secret word on it that everybody knows. But

                              know her better hold that hers is the master-key which will one day turn all the locks

                              astonished indignation and admiration, and her acquaintances—not her friends—were
                              still
                              wondering how she came to know so much of a life of which they decided she could know
                              nothing,
                              when suddenly Lady Susan Gresley died, and Hester went to live in the country with
                              her clergyman
                              brother.

                           <p id="d75437e1585">A few months later still, and on a mild April day, when the poor London trees had
                              black buds on
                              them, Rachel brushed and folded away in the little painted chest of drawers her few
                              threadbare
                              clothes, and put the boots—which the cobbler whose wife she had nursed had patched
                              for her—under
                              the shelf which held her few cups and plates and the faithful tin kettle, which had
                              always been
                              a cheerful boiler. And she washed her seven coarse handkerchiefs, and put them in
                              the
                              washband-stand drawer. And then she raked out the fire and cleaned the grate, and
                              set the room
                              in order. It was quickly done. She took up her hat which lay beside a bundle on the
                              bed. Her
                              hands trembled as she put it on. She looked wistfully round her, and her face worked.
                              The little
                              room which had looked so alien when she came to it six years ago had become a home.
                              She went to
                              the window and kissed the pane through which she had learnt to see so much. Then she
                              seized up
                              the bundle, and went quickly out, locking the door behind her, and taking the key
                              with her.

                              on the same
                              landing.

                              the grim
                              secret of how it came into being that no one was afraid of buying it.

                           <p id="d75437e1600">The woman smiled incredulously, giving one sharp glance at the bundle. She had seen
                              many
                              flittings. She should buy the kettle when Rachel's “sticks” were sold by the landlord
                              in default
                              of the rent.

                              and good
                              luck to ye. I shan't say as you've left.”

                           <p id="d75437e1606">“I shall come back,” said Rachel hoarsely, and she slipped downstairs like a thief.
                              She felt like
                              a thief. For she was rich. The man who had led her father into the speculations which
                              had ruined
                              him had died childless, and had bequeathed to her a colossal fortune.

                              remained in ignorance as to which of the two men had received his death warrant. Few

                              suspense easy to bear; but for the self-centred an intolerable element is added to

                              unselfish natures escape. From her early youth Lady Newhaven had been in the habit
                              of viewing

                              formed the central figure. At her confirmation the Bishop, the white-robed clergy,
                              and the other
                              candidates had served but as a nebulous background against which her own white-clad,
                              kneeling
                              figure, bowed in reverent devotion, stood out in high relief.

                              a stimulus
                              to her love of dress, when at last she met, as she would have expressed it, “the one

                           <p id="d75437e1652">And she had really said it later on. Hugh never did accuse her of coldness, but that
                              was a
                              detail. Those words, conned over many times, had nevertheless actually proceeded out
                              of her
                              mouth. Few of us have the power of saying anything we intend to say. But Lady Newhaven
                              had that
                              power, and enjoyed also in consequence a profound belief in her prophetic instincts;
                              while
                              others, Hugh not excepted, detected a premeditated tone in her conversation, and a
                              sense of
                              incongruity between her remarks and the occasion which called them forth.

                              remarks by making them in rapid rotation himself before proceeding to the matter in

                              did, any
                              allusions to their relative position, and because he ignored them she made many. “The

                              he added, hurriedly, “will be very refreshing after the glare and dust and empty worldly

                              but she had long vaguely felt that all conversation seemed to dry up in his presence.
                              He mopped
                              it all into his own sponge, so to speak, and left every subject exhausted.

                           <p id="d75437e1673">She rose in silent dignity, and went to her boudoir and lay down there. The heat was
                              very great,
                              and another fire was burning within her, withering her round cheek, and making her
                              small plump
                              hand look shrunk and thin. A fortnight had passed, and she had not heard from Hugh.
                              She had
                              written to him many times, at first only imploring him to meet her, but afterwards
                              telling him
                              she knew what had happened, and entreating him to put her out of suspense, to send
                              her one line
                              that his life was not endangered. She had received no answer to any of her letters.
                              She came to
                              the conclusion that they had been intercepted by Lord Newhaven, and that no doubt
                              the same fate
                              had befallen Hugh's letters to herself. For some time past, before the drawing of
                              lots, she had
                              noticed that Hugh's letters had become less frequent and shorter in length. She understood
                              the
                              reason now. Half of them had been intercepted. How that fact could account for the
                              shortness of
                              the remainder may not be immediately apparent to the prosaic mind, but it was obvious
                              to Lady
                              Newhaven. That Hugh had begun to weary of her could not force the narrow entrance
                              to her mind.
                              Such a possibility had never been even considered in the pictures of the future with
                              which her
                              imagination busied itself. But what would the future be? The road along which she
                              was walking
                              forked before her eyes, and her usual perspicacity was at fault. She knew not in which
                              of those
                              two diverging paths the future would lie.

                           <p id="d75437e1676">Would she in eighteen months' time—she should certainly refuse to marry within the

                              standing at the altar in a “confection” of lilac and white with Hugh; or would she
                              be a
                              miserable wife, moving ghostlike about her house, in coloured raiment, while a distant
                              grave was
                              always white with flowers sent by a nameless friend of the dead? “How some one must
                              have loved
                              him,” she imagined Hugh's aged mother saying. And once, as that bereaved mother came
                              in the dusk
                              to weep<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="44" data-tei-n="43"> </a></span> beside the grave, did she not see a shadowy figure
                              start up black-robed from the flower-laden sod, and hastily drawing a thick veil over
                              a
                              beautiful despairing face, glide away among the trees? At this point Lady Newhaven
                              always began
                              to cry. It was too heart-rending. And her mind in violent recoil was caught once more
                              and broken
                              on the same wheel. “Which?

                              acquaintance.

                              to be a penal offence. But I came at the entreaty of a former servant of yours. I
                              feel sure you
                              will let me carry some message of forgiveness to her as she is dying. Her name is
                              Morgan. Do you
                              remember her?”

                              her in the end; but I kept her as long as I could in spite of it. She had a genius
                              for
                              hair-dressing.”

                              She can't
                              return it, for of course she sold it and spent the money. But now at last she feels
                              she did
                              wrong, and she says she will die easier for your forgiveness.”

                           <p id="d75437e1703">“Oh! I forgive her,” said Lady Newhaven indifferently. “I often wondered how I lost
                              it. I never
                              cared about it.” She glanced at Rachel, and added tremulously, “My husband gave it
                              me.”

                           <p id="d75437e1706">A sudden impulse was urging her to confide in this grave, gentle-eyed woman. The temptation
                              was
                              all the stronger because Rachel, who had only lately appeared in society, was not
                              connected with
                              any portion of her previous life. She was as much a chance acquaintance as a fellow
                              passenger in
                              a railway carriage.

                              tell some one.” And she burst into violent weeping.

                              others confide early learn that their own engagements, their own pleasures and troubles
                              are
                              liable to be set aside at any moment. Rachel was a punctual, exact person, but she
                              missed many
                              trains. Those who sought her seldom realised that her day was as full as, possibly
                              fuller, than
                              their own. Perhaps it was only a very small pleasure to which she had been on her

                              particular morning, and for which she had put on that ethereal grey gown for the first

                              any rate, she relinquished it without a second thought.

                              escape. But
                              Lady Newhaven had no intention of letting her go. She only wished to indicate to her
                              her true
                              position. And gradually, not without renewed outbursts of tears, not without traversing
                              many
                              layers of prepared conventional feelings in which a few thin streaks of genuine emotion
                              were
                              embedded, she told her story—the story of a young, high-minded, and neglected wife,
                              and of a
                              husband callous, indifferent, a scorner of religion, unsoftened even by the advent
                              of the
                              children—“such sweet children, such little darlings”—and the gradual estrangement.
                              Then came the
                              persistent siege to the lonely heart of one not pretty perhaps, but fatally attractive
                              to men;
                              the lonely heart's unparalleled influence for good over the besieger.

                              over him
                              is simply boundless. If I said, as I sometimes did at balls, how sorry I was to see
                              some plain
                              girl standing out, he would go and dance with her. I have seen him do it.”

                           <p id="d75437e1772">Rachel was not so astonished as Lady Newhaven expected. She certainly was rather wooden,

                              the teller,
                              more and more liable to misconstruction. Rachel's heart ached as bit by bit the inevitable
                              development was finally reached in floods of tears.

                              of real anguish upon her breast.

                              reflect the spirit of that quiet county, so slow is its course, so narrow is its width.
                              Even the
                              roads don't take the trouble to bridge it. They merely hump themselves slightly when
                              they feel
                              it tickling underneath them, and go on, vouchsafing no further notice of its existence.
                              Yet the
                              Drone is a local celebrity in Middleshire, and, like most local celebrities, is unknown
                              elsewhere. The squire's sons have lost immense trout in the Drone as it saunters through
                              their
                              lands, and most of them have duly earned thereby the distinction (in Middleshire)
                              of being the
                              best trout rod in England. Middleshire bristles with the “best shots in England,”
                              and the “best
                              preachers in England,” and the cleverest men in England. The apathetic Mother country
                              knows,
                              according to Middleshire, “but little of her greatest men.” At present she associates
                              her loyal
                              county with a breed of small black pigs.

                              to leave the
                              rich low meadow lands and clustering villages upon its way. After skirting the little
                              town of
                              Westhope and the gardens of Westhope Abbey, the Drone lays itself out in comfortable
                              curves and
                              twists innumerable through the length and breadth of the green country till it reaches
                              Warpington, whose church is so near the stream that in time of flood the water hitches
                              all kinds
                              of things it has no further use for among the gravestones of the little churchyard.
                              On one
                              occasion, after repeated prayers for<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="52" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span> rain, it even overflowed
                              the lower part of the vicar's garden, and vindictively carried away his beehives.
                              But that was

                              that both fanatic and saint were fighting for predominance in the kingdom of that
                              pinched brain,
                              the narrowness of which the sloping forehead betokened with such cruel plainness.
                              He looked as
                              if he would fling himself as hard against a truth without perceiving it, as a hunted
                              hare
                              against a stone wall. He was unmistakably of those who who only see side issues.

                           <p id="d75437e1999">Mrs. Gresley took her husband's arm as he closed the gate. She was still young and
                              still pretty,
                              in spite of the arduous duties of a clergyman's wife, and the depressing fact that
                              she seemed
                              always wearing out old finery. Perhaps her devotion to her husband had served to prolong
                              her
                              youth, for as the ivy is to the oak, and as the moon is to the sun, and as the river
                              is to the
                              sea, so was Mrs. Gresley to Mr. Gresley.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2002">The fortunate couple were advancing through the garden looking fondly at their own
                              vicarage, with
                              their own sponges hanging out of their upper windows, and their offspring waving to
                              them from a
                              third, when a small slight figure appeared on the terrace.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2005">“James!” said Mrs. Gresley with decision. “It is your duty to speak to Hester about
                              attending
                              early service. If she can go out in the garden she can come to church.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2008">“I have spoken to her once,” said Mr. Gresley, frowning, “and though I put it before
                              her very
                              plainly she showed great obstinacy. Fond as I am of Hester, I cannot shut my eyes
                              to the fact
                              that she has an arrogant and callous nature. But we must remember, my love, that Aunt
                              Susan was
                              most lax in all her views, and we must make allowance for Hester, who<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="53"> </a></span> lived with her till last year. It is only natural that Hester, bred
                              up from childhood in that worldly circle—dinner parties all through Lent, and Sunday
                              luncheons—should have fallen through want of solid church teaching into freethinking,
                              and ideas
                              of her own upon religion.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2013">Mr. Gresley's voice was of that peculiar metallic note which carries further than
                              the owner is
                              aware. It rose, if contradicted, into a sort of continuous trumpet-blast which drowned
                              all other
                              lesser voices. Hester's little garret was two stories above Mr. Gresley's study on
                              the ground
                              floor, but nevertheless she often heard confused anxious parochial buzzings overwhelmed
                              by that
                              sustained high note which knew no cessation until objection or opposition ceased.
                              As she came
                              towards them, she heard with perfect distinctness what he was saying, but it did not
                              trouble
                              her. Hester was gifted with imagination, and imagination does not find it difficult
                              to read by
                              the short hand of the expressions and habitual opinions and repressions of others
                              what they
                              occasionally say at full length, and to which they fondly believe they are giving
                              utterance for
                              the first time. Mr. Gresley had said all this many times already by his manner, and
                              it had by
                              its vain repetitions lost its novelty. Mr. Gresley was fortunately not aware of this,
                              for
                              unimaginative persons believe themselves to be sealed books, as hermetically sealed
                              as the
                              characters of others are to themselves.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2016">Hester was very like her brother. She had the same nose, slightly too long for her
                              small face,
                              the same short upper lip and light hair, only her brother's was straight and hers
                              was crimped,
                              as wet sand is crimped by a placid outgoing sea. That she had an equally strong will
                              was
                              obvious. But there the likeness ended. Hester's figure was slight, and she stooped
                              a little.
                              Hester's eyes were very gentle, very appealing under their long curled lashes. They
                              were sad,
                              too, as Mr. Gresley's never were, gay as his never were. An infinite patience looked
                              out of them
                              sometimes, that patience of enthusiasm which will cast away its very soul and all
                              its best years
                              for the sake of an ideal. Hester showed her age in her eyes. She was seven<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="55" data-tei-n="54"> </a></span> and twenty and appeared many years younger, until she looked at
                              you.

                           <p id="d75437e2022">Mrs. Gresley looked with veiled irritation at her sister-in-law in her clean holland
                              gown, held
                              in at the waist with a broad lilac ribbon, adroitly drawn in picturesque folds through
                              a little
                              silver buckle.

                           <p id="d75437e2025">Mrs. Gresley, who had a waist which the Southminster dressmaker informed her had “to
                              be kept
                              down,” made a mental note for the hundredth time that Hester “laced in.”

                           <p id="d75437e2028">Hester gave that impression of “finish” and sharpness of edge so rarely found among
                              the blurred
                              vague outlines of Englishwomen. There was nothing vague about her. Lord Newhaven said
                              she had
                              been cut out body and mind with a sharp pair of scissors. Her irregular profile, her
                              delicate
                              pointed speech and fingers, her manner of picking up her slender feet as she walked,
                              her quick
                              alert movements, everything about her was neat, adjusted, perfect in its way, yet
                              without more
                              apparent effort than the

                           <p id="d75437e2034">“Good morning,” she said, turning back with them to the house. “Abel says it is going
                              to be the
                              hottest day we have had yet. And the letter-bag is so fat that I could hardly refrain
                              from
                              opening it. Really, James, you ought to hide the key, or I shall succumb to temptation.”

                           <p id="d75437e2037">Once in the days of her ignorance, when she first came to live at Warpington, Hester
                              had actually
                              turned the key in the lock of the sacred letter-bag when the Gresleys were both late,
                              and had
                              extracted her own letters. She never did it a second time. On the contrary, she begged
                              pardon in
                              real regret at having given such deep offence to her brother and his wife, and in
                              astonishment
                              that so simple an action could offend. She had made an equally distressing blunder
                              in the early
                              days of her life with the Gresleys by taking up the daily paper on its arrival in
                              the
                              afternoon.

                           <p id="d75437e2040">“My dear Hester,” Mrs. Gresley said, really scandalised, “I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="56" data-tei-n="55"> </a></span> am
                              sure you won't mind my saying so, but James has not seen his paper yet.”

                              <emph id="d75437e2051">first</emph> to look at it,” said Mrs. Gresley with a great exercise of patience. She
                              had heard Hester was clever, but she found her very stupid. Everything had to be explained
                              to
                              her.

                           <p id="d75437e2055">Her tone recalled Hester from the Indian tribal rising, and the speech of the Prime
                              Minister, to
                              the realities of life. It was fortunate for her that she was quick-witted. These two
                              flagrant
                              blunders were sufficient for her. She grasped the principle that those who have a
                              great love of
                              power and little scope for it must necessarily exercise it in trivial matters. She
                              extended the
                              principle of the newspaper and the letter-bag over her entire intercourse with the
                              Gresleys, and
                              never offended in that manner again.

                           <p id="d75437e2058">On this particular morning she waited decorously beside her brother as he opened the
                              bag, and
                              dealt out the contents into three heaps. Hester pounced on hers, and subsided into
                              her chair at
                              the breakfast-table.

                              her share of
                              the morning's correspondence—namely, a list of Pryce Jones, “that you care to write
                              so many
                              letters, Hester. I am sure I never did such a thing when I was a girl. I should have
                              regarded it
                              as a waste of time.”

                              My paper upon ‘Modern Dissent.’ I told Edwards I would not allow him to put it in

                           <p id="d75437e2073">He looked at Hester. She had laid down her letters and was taking a cup of coffee
                              from Mrs.
                              Gresley. She evidently had not heard her brother's remark.

                           <p id="d75437e2076">“You and I must lay our heads together over this, Hester,” he said, holding up with
                              some pride a
                              long slip of proof. “It will be just in your line. You might run it over after breakfast,”
                              he
                              continued, in high good humour, “and put in the stops and grammar and spelling—you're
                              more up in
                              that sort of thing than I am—and then we will go through it together.”

                           <p id="d75437e2079">Hester was quite accustomed, when her help was asked as to a composition, to receive
                              as a reason
                              for the request the extremely gratifying assurance that she was “good” at punctuation
                              and
                              spelling. It gave the would-be author a comfortable feeling that after all he was
                              only asking
                              advice on the crudest technical matters on which Hester's superiority could be admitted
                              without
                              a loss of masculine self-respect.

                           <p id="d75437e2082">“I would rather not tamper with punctuation and spelling,” said Hester, drily. “I
                              am so shaky on
                              both myself. You had better ask the schoolmaster. He knows all that sort of A B C
                              better than I
                              do.”

                           <p id="d75437e2085">Mr. Gresley frowned and looked suspiciously at her. He wanted Hester's opinion, of
                              which she was
                              perfectly aware. But she intended that he should ask for it.

                           <p id="d75437e2089">Mrs. Gresley, behind the coffee-pot, felt that she was overlooked. She had helped

                              with his numerous literary efforts until Hester came.

                              day in the
                              hay-field.”

                           <p id="d75437e2098">“Oh well!” said Mr. Gresley, “don't let us split hairs. I don't want an argument about
                              it. If
                              you'll come into my study at ten o'clock I'll get it off my hands at once.”

                              a hundred
                              times to get the better of him in conversation, but she had not yet succeeded.

                              Loftus writes
                              that she is returning to Wilderleigh at the end of the week, and that the sale of
                              work may take
                              place in the Wilderleigh gardens at the end of August. And—let me see, I will read
                              what she
                              says:

                           <p id="d75437e2110">“‘I am not unmindful of our conversation on the duty of those who go annually to London
                              to bring
                              a spiritual influence to bear on society.’—(“I impressed that upon her before she
                              went up.”)—‘We
                              had a most interesting dinner-party last week, nearly all celebrated and gifted persons,
                              and the
                              conversation was really beyond anything I can describe to you. I thought my poor brain
                              would
                              turn. I was quite afraid to join in. But Mr. Harvey, the great Mr. Harvey, told me
                              afterwards I
                              was at my best. One lady, Miss Barker, who has done so much for the East End, is coming
                              down to
                              Wilderleigh shortly for a rest. I am anxious you should talk to her. She says she
                              has doubts,
                              and she is tired of the Bible. By the way, please tell Hester, with my love, that
                              she and Mr.
                              Harvey attacked “The Idyll of East London” and showed it up entirely, and poor little
                              me had to
                              stand up for her against them all.’”

                           <p id="d75437e2113">“She would never do that,” said Hester, tranquilly. “She might perhaps have said,

                              a friend of mine. I must stand up for her.’ But she would never have gone beyond saying
                              it to
                              doing it.”

                           <p id="d75437e2116">“Hester,” exclaimed Mrs. Gresley, feeling that she might just as well have remained
                              a spinster if
                              she was to be thus ignored in her own house, “I can't think how you can allow your
                              jealousy of
                              Sybell Loftus, for I can attribute it to nothing else, to carry you so far.”

                              “You must
                              forgive me if I spoke irritably. I have a racking headache.”

                           <p id="d75437e2122">“She looks ill,” said her brother, following Hester's figure with affectionate solicitude
                              as she
                              passed the window a moment later.

                           <p id="d75437e2128">“And yet she does next to nothing,” said the hard-worked little wife, intercepting
                              the glance. “I
                              always thought she wrote her stories in the morning. I know she is never about if
                              the Pratt
                              girls call to see her before luncheon. Yet when I ran up to her room yesterday morning
                              to ask
                              her to take Mary's music, as 
                              <sic id="d75437e2130">Fraülein</sic> had the headache”—(Mrs. Gresley always spoke of
                              the headache and the toothache)—“she was lying on her bed doing nothing at all.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2134">“She is very unaccountable,” said Mr. Gresley. “Still, I can make allowance for the
                              artistic
                              temperament. I share it to a certain degree. Poor Hester. She is a spoilt child.”

                           <p id="d75437e2137">“Indeed, James, she is. And she has an enormous opinion of herself. For my part, I
                              think the
                              Bishop is to blame for making so much of her. Have you never noticed how different
                              she is when
                              he is here, so gay and talkative, and when we are alone she hardly says a word for
                              days
                              together, except to the children.”

                           <p id="d75437e2140">“She talked more when she first came,” said Mr. Gresley. “But when she found I make
                              it a rule to
                              discourage argument”—(by argument Mr. Gresley meant difference of opinion)—“she seemed
                              gradually
                              to lose interest in conversation. Yet I have heard the Bishop speak of her as a brilliant
                              talker. And Lord Newhaven asked me last spring how I liked having a celebrity for
                              a sister. A
                              celebrity! Why, half the people in Middleshire don't even know of Hester's existence.”
                              And the
                              author of “Modern Dissent” frowned.

                           <p id="d75437e2143">“That was a hit at you, my dear,” said Mrs. Gresley. “It was just after your pamphlet
                              on ‘Schism’
                              appeared. Lord Newhaven always says something disagreeable. Don't you remember when
                              you were
                              thinking of exchanging Warpington for that Scotch living he said he knew you would
                              not do it
                              because with your feeling towards Dissent you would never go to a country where you
                              would be a
                              Dissenter yourself.”

                              obtain popularity, for that is what it comes to in these days. The public must be

                              It must be amused. The public likes smooth things, and the great truths—the only things

                              want waking

                              that if some
                              of his younger clergy could be waked up to a sense of their own arrogance and narrowness

                              would hold a public thanksgiving in the cathedral. But he added that he thought nothing

                           <p id="d75437e2286">Presently Mr. Gresley's eloquence, after various tortuous and unnatural windings,
                              swept in the
                              direction of a pun, as a carriage after following the artificial curves of a deceptive

                              nears a villa. Hester had seen the pun coming for half a page, as we see the villa
                              through the
                              trees long before we are allowed to approach it, and she longed to save her brother
                              from what
                              was in her eyes as much a degradation as a

                              remembered in time that the Gresleys considered she had no sense of humour, and she
                              decided to
                              let it pass. Mr. Gresley enjoyed it so much himself that he hardly noticed her fixed
                              countenance.

                              none, are
                              compensated by the conviction that they possess it more abundantly. The crevasse seems
                              to extend
                              far inland to the very heights and water-sheds of character. Those who differ on humour
                              will
                              differ on principles. The Gresleys and the Pratts belonged to that large class of
                              our fellow
                              creatures, who, conscious of a genius for adding to the hilarity of our sad planet,
                              discover an
                              irresistible piquancy in putting a woman's hat on a man's head, and in that “verbal
                              romping”
                              which playfully designates a whisky and soda as a gargle, and says “au reservoir”
                              instead of “au

                              of the last.

                              contemplative life by an exhibition of humour, and scrambling out of the water proceeded
                              to
                              canter along the bank with stiff raised tails, with an artificial noose sustained
                              with
                              difficulty just above the tuft.

                           <p id="d75437e2404">“How like James and the Pratts,” hester said to herself, watching the grotesque gambols
                              and
                              nudgings of the dwindling humorists. “It must be very fatiguing to be so comic.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2407">Hester had been up since five o'clock, utilising the quiet hours before the house
                              was astir. She
                              was tired out. A “bumble bee” was droning sleepily near at hand. The stream talked
                              and talked
                              and talked about what he was going to do when he was a river. “How tired the banks
                              must be of
                              listening to him,” thought Hester with closed eyes.

                              as it seemed to her, she was suddenly awakened by Mr. Gresley's voice near at hand.

                              at “Auntie Hester” as she sat down at the luncheon table, beside the black bottle
                              which marked
                              her place. The Gresleys were ardent total abstainers, and were of opinion that Hester's
                              health
                              would be greatly benefited by following their example. But Hester's doctor differed
                              from them—he
                              was extremely obstinate—with the result that the Gresleys were obliged to tolerate
                              the obnoxious
                              bottle on their very table. It was what Mrs. Gresley called a “cross,” and Mr. Gresley
                              was
                              always afraid that the fact of its presence might become known and hopelessly misconstrued
                              in
                              Warpington and the world at large.

                           <p id="d75437e2474">The children knew that Hester was in disgrace, as she vainly tried to eat the congealed
                              slice of
                              roast mutton with blue slides in it, which had been put before her chair half an hour
                              ago, when
                              the joint was sent out for the servants' dinner. The children liked “Auntie Hester,”
                              but without
                              enthusiasm, except Regie, the eldest, who loved her as himself. She could tell them
                              stories, and
                              make butterflies and horses and dogs out of paper, but she could never join in their
                              games, not
                              even in the delightful new ones she invented for them. She was always tired directly.
                              And she
                              would never give them rides on her back, as the large good-natured Pratt girls did.
                              And she was
                              dreadfully shocked if they did not play fair, so much so, that on one occasion Mr.
                              Gresley had
                              to interfere, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="70" data-tei-n="69"> </a></span> to remind her that a game was a game, and
                              that it would be better to let the children play as they liked than to be perpetually
                              finding
                              fault with them.

                           <p id="d75437e2480">Perhaps nothing in her life at the Vicarage was a greater trial to Hester than to
                              see the rules
                              of fair play broken by the children with the connivance of their parents. Mr. Gresley
                              had never
                              been to a public school, and had thus missed the A B C of what in its later stages
                              is called
                              “honour.” He was an admirable hockey player, but he was not in request at the frequent
                              Slumberleigh matches, for he never hit off fair, or minded being told so.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2483">“Auntie Hester is leaving all her fat,” said Mary suddenly in a shrill voice, her
                              portion of pear
                              held in her left cheek as she spoke. She had no idea that she ought not to draw attention
                              to the
                              weakness of others. She was only anxious to be the first to offer interesting information.

                           <p id="d75437e2486">“Never mind,” said Mrs. Gresley, admiring her own moderation. “Finish your pear.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2489">If there was one thing more than another in Hester's behaviour that annoyed Mrs. Gresley—and
                              there were several others—it was Hester's manner of turning her food over on her plate,
                              and
                              leaving half of it.

                           <p id="d75437e2492">Hester did it again now, and Mrs. Gresley, already irritated by her unpunctuality,
                              tried to look
                              away so as not to see her and prayed for patience. The hundred a year which Hester
                              contributed
                              to the little establishment had eased the struggling household in many ways; but Mrs.
                              Gresley
                              sometimes wondered if the money, greatly needed as it was, counterbalanced the perpetual
                              friction of her sister-in-law's presence.

                              him. Children, say grace,”

                           <p id="d75437e2532">It was Wednesday and a half-holiday, and Mrs. Gresley had arranged to take the children
                              in the
                              pony-carriage to be measured for new boots. These expeditions to Westhope were a great
                              event. At
                              two o'clock exactly the three children rushed downstairs, Regie bearing in his hand
                              his tin
                              money-box, in which a single coin could be heard to leap. Hester produced a bright
                              threepenny
                              piece for each child, one of which was irretrievably buried in Regie's money-box,
                              and the other
                              two immediately lost in the mat in the pony-carriage. However, Hester found them,
                              and slipped
                              them inside their white gloves, and the expedition started, accompanied by Boulou,
                              a diminutive
                              yellow and white dog of French extraction. Boulou was a well-meaning, kind little
                              soul. There
                              was a certain hurried arrogance about his hind legs, but it was only manner. He was
                              not in
                              reality more conceited than most small dogs who wear their tails high.

                              for a
                              ruri-dicanal Chapter meeting in the opposite direction. She heard the Vicarage gate
                              “clink”
                              behind him as she crossed the little hall, and then she suddenly stopped short and
                              wrung her
                              hands. She had forgotten to tell either of them that the Bishop of

                              was coming on purpose to see her, but this would have been incredible to the Gresleys.
                              She had
                              not read Rachel's letter announcing his coming till she had taken refuge in the field
                              where she
                              had fallen asleep, and her mental equilibrium had been so shaken by the annoyance
                              she felt she
                              had caused the Gresleys at luncheon that she had entirely forgotten the subject till
                              this

                              Hester to-day.
                              She reached the turn of the road only to see the bent figure of Mr. Gresley whisk
                              swiftly out of
                              sight, his clerical coat-tails flowing gracefully out behind like a divided skirt
                              on each side
                              of the back wheel.

                              “They will
                              never believe I forgot to tell them,” she said to herself. “Everything I do is wrong

                              leaned her
                              head against the banisters.

                              to her
                              friend on a little tray, with two thin slices of bread and butter.

                              her hands. “It is wrong of me to give so much trouble.” She did not want the egg,
                              but she knew
                              its oval was the only shape in which 
                              <sic id="d75437e2566">Fraülein</sic> could express her silent sympathy. So
                              she accepted it gratefully, and ate it on the stairs, with the tenderly severe

                           <p id="d75437e2573">Life did not seem quite such a hopeless affair when the little meal was finished.
                              There were
                              breaks in the clouds after all. Rachel was coming to see her that afternoon. Hester
                              was, as
                              
                              <sic id="d75437e2575">Fraülein</sic> often said, “easy cast down, and easy<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="73" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span>
                              cast up.” The mild stimulant of the egg “cast her up” once more. She kissed 
                              <sic id="d75437e2580">Fraülein</sic>
                              and ran up to her room, where she divested her small person of every speck of dust

                              the road, smoothed out an invisible crease in her holland gown, put back the little
                              ring of hair
                              behind her ear which had become loosened in her rush after her brother, and then came
                              down
                              smiling and composed to await her friend in the drawing-room.

                           <p id="d75437e2584">Hester seldom sat in the drawing-room, partly because it was her sister-in-law's only
                              sitting-room, and partly because it was the regular haunt of the Pratt girls, who
                              (with what
                              seemed to Hester dreadful familiarity) looked in at the windows when they came to
                              call, and, if
                              they saw any one inside, entered straightway by the same, making retreat impossible.

                           <p id="d75437e2588">The Miss Pratts had been willing, when Hester first came into the neighbourhood, to
                              take a
                              good-natured though precarious interest in “their Vicar's sister.” Indeed, Mrs. Gresley
                              had felt
                              obliged to warn Hester not to count too much on their attentions, “as they sometimes
                              dropped
                              people as quickly as they took them up.”

                           <p id="d75437e2591">Hester was ignorant of country life, of its small society, its inevitable relations
                              with
                              unsympathetic neighbours just because they were neighbours; and she was specially
                              ignorant of
                              the class to which Mrs. Gresley and the Pratts belonged, and from which her aunt had
                              in her
                              lifetime unwisely guarded her niece as from the plague. She was amazed at first at
                              the Pratts
                              calling her by her Christian name without her leave, until she discovered that they
                              spoke of the
                              whole county by their Christian names, even designating Lord Newhaven's two younger
                              brothers—with whom they were not acquainted—as Jack and Harry, though they were invariably
                              called by their own family John and Henry.

                              pleasant feeling that at any rate she was not going among strangers. She had often
                              visited in
                              Middleshire, at Wilderleigh, in the elder Mr. Loftus' time, for whom she had entertained
                              an
                              enthusiastic reverence; at Westhope Abbey, where she had a firm ally in Lord Newhaven,
                              and at
                              several other Middleshire houses. She was silly enough to think she knew Middleshire
                              fairly
                              well, but after she settled at Warpington she gradually discovered the existence of
                              a large
                              under-current of society of which she knew nothing at all, in which, whether she were
                              willing or
                              not, she was plunged by the fact that she was her brother's sister.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2599">Hester perceived clearly enough that her brother did not by birth belong to this set,
                              though his
                              profession brought him in contact with it, but he had evidently though involuntarily
                              adopted it
                              for better for worse; perhaps because a dictatorial habit is generally constrained
                              to find
                              companionship in a social grade lower than its own, where a loud voice and a tendency
                              to
                              monologue chequered by prehistoric jokes and tortured puns may meet with a more patient
                              audience. Hester made many discoveries about herself during the first months of her
                              life at
                              Warpington, and the first of the series amazed her more than any of the later ones.

                           <p id="d75437e2602">She discovered that she was proud. Perhaps she had not the enormous opinion of herself
                              which Mrs.
                              Gresley so frequently deplored, for Hester's thoughts seldom dwelt upon herself. But
                              the altered
                              circumstances of her life forced them momentarily upon herself nevertheless, as a
                              burst pipe
                              will spread its waters down a damask curtain.

                           <p id="d75437e2605">So far, during the eight years since she had left the schoolroom, she had always been
                              “Miss
                              Gresley,” a little personage treated with consideration wherever she went, and 
                              <foreign id="d75437e2607" xml:lang="fre">choyée</foreign> for her delicate humour and talent for conversation. She now
                              experienced the interesting sensation, as novel to her as it is familiar to most of
                              us, of being
                              nobody, and she disliked it. The manners of the set in which she found herself also<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="75" data-tei-n="74"> </a></span> grated continually on her fastidious taste. She was first amazed and
                              then indignant at bearing her old Middleshire friends, whose simplicity far surpassed
                              that of
                              her new acquaintance, denounced by the latter—without being acquainted with them except
                              officially—as “fine,” as caring only for “London people,” and as being “tuft-hunters,”
                              because
                              they frequently entertained at their houses persons of rank, to half of whom they
                              were related.
                              All this was new to Hester. She discovered that, though she might pay visits at these
                              houses,
                              she must never mention them, as it was considered the height of vulgarity to speak
                              of people of
                              rank.

                           <p id="d75437e2614">Mrs. Gresley, who had been quite taken aback when the first of these invitations came,
                              felt it
                              her duty to warn Hester against a love of rank, reminding her that it was a very bad
                              thing to
                              get a name for running after titled people.

                           <p id="d75437e2617">“James and I have always kept clear of that,” she remarked with dignity. “For my part,
                              I daresay
                              you will think me very old-fashioned, but I must own I never can see that people with
                              titles or
                              wealth are one bit nicer or pleasanter than those without them.”

                              to bow down
                              before any one. If I am unworldly, it is because I had the advantage of parents who
                              impressed on
                              me the hollowness of all social distinctions. If the Pratts were given a title to-morrow
                              I
                              should behave exactly the same to them as I do now.”

                              Hester might
                              have had the advantage of hearing all these well-worn sentiments, and of realising
                              the point of
                              view of a large number of her fellow creatures before she became an inconspicuous

                              of Mrs.
                              Gresley that kindness was one thing and intimacy another.

                              get it from the
                              Pratts and us, she has to go to those below her in the social scale, like Miss Brown,

                              give it to her. Miss Brown may be very cultivated. I dare say she is, but she makes
                              up to

                              the very few

                              the unconcealed surprise of the Pratts and the Gresleys. Sybell adored Hester's book,

                              sister.” She enthusiastically suggested to Hester several improvements which might
                              easily be
                              made in it, which would have changed its character altogether. She even entrenched
                              on the sacred
                              precinct of a married woman's time to write out the openings of several romances,

                              always running over to the Vicarage to confide to Hester the unique thoughts which
                              had been

                              every flower it involuntarily alighted on and drew honey from to be its own special

                              it of myself.
                              James and Minna never say anything, but I know it vexes them, as of course it must.”

                              woman of the world she was a child. There was, alas! no medium in her character. Rachel
                              noticed
                              how thin her face and hands had become, and the strained look in the eyes. The faint
                              colour in
                              her cheek had a violet tinge.

                              temper of a

                              <emph id="d75437e2749">they</emph> call ‘county people.’ Their father made a fortune in oil, and
                              built a house covered with turrets near here a few years ago. I used to know Captain
                              Pratt, the
                              son, very slightly in London. I never would dance with him. He used to come to our
                              ‘At Homes,’
                              but he was never asked to dinner. He is a great ‘parti’ among a certain set down here.
                              His
                              mother and sisters were very kind to me when I came, but I was not so accustomed then
                              as I am
                              now to be treated familiarly and called ‘Hessie,’ which no one has ever called me
                              before, and I
                              am afraid I was not so responsive as I see now I ought to have been. Down here it
                              seems your
                              friends are the people whom you live near, not the ones you like. It seems a curious
                              arrangement. And as the Pratts are James' and Minna's greatest friends, I did not
                              wish to offend
                              them. And then, of course, I did offend them mortally at last by losing my temper
                              when they came
                              up to my room to what they called ‘rout me out,’ though I had told them I was busy
                              in the
                              mornings. I was in a very difficult place, and when they came in I did not know who
                              they were,
                              because only the people in the book were real just then. And then when I recognised
                              them, and
                              the scene in my mind which I had<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="80" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span> been waiting for for weeks was
                              shattered like a pane of glass, I became quite giddy and spoke wildly. And then—I
                              was so ashamed
                              afterwards—I burst into tears of rage and despair.”

                              handkerchief just large enough to receive them, and went on with a quaver in her voice.

                              had lost my temper, but they have not been the same since. Not that I wanted them
                              to be the
                              same. I would rather they were different. But I was anxious to keep on cordial terms

                              Minna's friends. She quarrels with them herself, but that is different. I suppose
                              it is
                              inevitable if you are on terms of great intimacy with people you don't really care

                              She saw that
                              Hester, always delicate, was making an enormous effort under conditions which would
                              be certain
                              to entail disastrous effects on her health. The book was sapping her strength like

                              and the Gresleys were evidently exhausting it still further by unconsciously strewing

                              with difficulties. Rachel did not know them, but she supposed they belonged to that

                              whose eyes are holden.

                              colour came and went. She was transfigured.

                              place to a certain wistful, half envious admiration. She had once been shaken by all
                              these
                              emotions herself, years ago, when she was in love. She had regarded them as a revelation

                              they lasted; and—afterwards—as a steep step, a very steep step upon the stair of life.
                              But she
                              realised now that such as Hester live constantly in the world which the greater number
                              of us can
                              only enter when human passion lends us the key; the world at which, when the gates
                              are shut
                              against us, the coarser minded among us are not ashamed to level their ridicule and
                              contempt.

                              vision,
                              inaccessible as a sunset.

                              day by day travestying it, caricaturing the beautiful thoughts that come into my mind.

                              “Hemma” to a sense of duty from the backyard, “Hemma” breathlessly ushered in the

                              face and sinewy frame. If you had seen him working a crane in a stonemason's yard,
                              or leading a
                              cut-and-thrust forlorn-hope, or sailing paper-boats with a child, you would have felt
                              he was the
                              right man in the right place. That he was also in his right place as a bishop had
                              never been
                              doubted by any one. Mr. Gresley was the only person who had occasionally had misgivings
                              as to
                              the Bishop's vocation as a true priest, but he had put them aside as disloyal.

                           <p id="d75437e2834">Jowett is believed to have said, “A Bishop without a sense of humour is lost.” Perhaps
                              that may
                              have been one of the reasons why, by Jowett's advice, the See of Southminster was
                              offered to its
                              present occupant. The Bishop's mouth, though it spoke of an indomitable will, had
                              a certain
                              twist of the lip, his deep-set, benevolent eyes had a certain twinkle which made persons
                              like
                              Lord Newhaven and Hester hail him at once as an ally, but which ought to have been
                              a
                              danger-signal to some of his clerical brethren—to Mr. Gresley in particular.

                           <p id="d75437e2838">The Bishop respected and upheld Mr. Gresley as a clergyman, but as a conversationalist
                              the young
                              Vicar wearied him. If the truth were known (which it never was) he had arranged to
                              visit Hester
                              when he knew Mr. Gresley would be engaging the reluctant attention of a ruri-dicanal
                              meeting.

                           <p id="d75437e2846">Hester made tea, and presently the Bishop, who looked much exhausted, roused himself.
                              He had that
                              afternoon attended two deathbeds, one the deathbed of a friend, and the other that
                              of the last
                              vestige of peace, expiring amid the clamour of a distracted Low Church parish and
                              High Church
                              parson, who could only meet each other after the fashion of cymbals. For the moment
                              even his
                              courageous spirit had been disheartened.

                           <p id="d75437e2849">“I met a son of Anak the other night at the Newhavens,” he said to Hester, “who claimed
                              you as a
                              cousin—a Mr. Richard Vernon. He broke the ice by informing me that I had confirmed
                              him, and that
                              perhaps I should like to know that he had turned out better than he expected.”

                           <p id="d75437e2852">“How like Dick,” said Hester.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e2855">“I remembered him at last. His father was the squire of Fallow, where I was rector
                              before I came
                              to Southminster. Dick was not a source of unmixed pleasure to his parents. As a boy
                              of eight he
                              sowed the parental billiard-table with mustard and cress in his father's absence,
                              and raised a
                              very good crop, and performed other excruciating experiments. I believe he beat all
                              previous
                              records of birch rods at Eton. I remember while he was there he won a bet from another
                              boy who
                              could not pay, and he foreclosed on the loser's cricketing trousers. His parents were
                              distressed
                              about it when he brought them home, and I tried to make him see that he ought not
                              to have taken
                              them. But Dick held firm. He said it was like tithe, and if he could not get his own
                              in money as
                              I did he must collect it in trousers. I must own he had me there. I noticed that he
                              wore the
                              garments daily as long as any question remained in his parents' minds as to whether
                              they ought
                              to be returned. After that I felt sure he would succeed in life.”

                           <p id="d75437e2862">“I advised his father to send him abroad. There really was not room for him in England,
                              and
                              unfortunately for the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span> army, the examiners jibbed at his
                              strictly phonetic spelling. He tells me he has given up being an A.D.C. and has taken
                              to
                              vine-growing, because if people are up in the world they always drink freely, and
                              if they are
                              ‘down on their luck’ they drink all the more to drown care. The reasoning appeared
                              to me
                              sound.”

                              the same
                              reason, about playing fair. Poor James did not know that games were matters of deadly
                              importance, and that a rule was a sacred thing. I wonder why it is that clergymen
                              so often have
                              the same code of honour as women; quite a different code from that of the average
                              man.”

                           <p id="d75437e2870">“I think,” said the Bishop, “it is owing to that difference of code that women clash
                              so
                              hopelessly with men when they attempt to compete or work with them. Women have not
                              to begin with
                              the 
                              <foreign id="d75437e2872" xml:lang="fre">esprit de corps</foreign> which the most ordinary men possess. With
                              what difficulty can one squeeze out of a man any fact that is detrimental to his friend,
                              or even
                              to his acquaintance, however obviously necessary it may be that the information should
                              be asked
                              for and given. Yet I have known many good and earnest and affectionate women who lead
                              unselfish
                              lives, who will ‘give away’ their best woman friend at the smallest provocation, or
                              without any
                              provocation at all; will inform you 
                              <foreign id="d75437e2875" xml:lang="fre">à propos</foreign> of nothing that
                              she was jilted years ago, or that her husband married her for her money. The causes
                              of
                              humiliation and disaster in a woman's life seem to have no sacredness for her women
                              friends. Yet
                              if that same friend whom she has run down is ill, the runner down will nurse her day
                              and night
                              with absolutely selfless devotion.”

                              about
                              women, and perhaps that is the reason. They show themselves capable of some deep affection
                              or
                              some great self-sacrifice, and I respect and admire them, and think they are like
                              that all
                              through. And the day comes when they are not quite straightforward, or are guilty<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="85"> </a></span> of some petty meanness, which a man who is not fit to black their

                              into the drawing-room, accompanied by Boulou, in a frantic state of excitement. Boulou,
                              like
                              Hester, had no happy medium in his character. He was what Mrs. Gresley called “very

                              and he now showed his “Frenchyness” by a foolish exhibition of himself in coursing
                              round and
                              round the room with his silly foreign tail crooked the wrong way.

                              what they had bought.

                              was nervously surprised at the lapse of time. The carriage was sent for, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="88" data-tei-n="87"> </a></span> in a few minutes that dignified vehicle was bowling back to

                              tense expression of a person who is making a colossal effort to be patient, and whose
                              patience,
                              after successfully meeting twenty calls upon it in the course of the day, collapses
                              entirely at
                              the twenty-first. That is a humiliating experience.”

                              to her according to his lights, and if she could write little goody-goody books he
                              would admire
                              her immensely, and so would half the neighbourhood. It would be felt to be suitable.
                              But Hester
                              jars against the preconceived ideas which depute that clergymen's sisters and daughters
                              should,
                              as a matter of course, offer up their youth and hair and teeth and eyesight on the

                              parochial work. She does and is nothing that long custom expects her to do and be.
                              Originality
                              is out of place in a clergyman's family, just because it is so urgently needed. It
                              is a constant
                              source of friction. But, on the other hand, the best thing that could happen to Hester
                              is to be
                              thrown for a time among people who regard her as a

                              she
                              has at heart. If Hester had remained in London after the success of her ‘Idyll’ she
                              would have
                              met with so much sympathy and admiration that her next book would probably have suffered
                              in
                              consequence. She is so susceptible, so expansive, that repression is positively necessary
                              to her
                              to enable her, so to speak, to get up steam. There is no place for getting up steam
                              like a
                              country vicarage with an inner

                              outer one of amiable country neighbours, mildly contemptuous of originality in any
                              form. She
                              cannot be in sympathy with them in her present stage. It is her loss, not theirs.
                              At forty she
                              will be in sympathy with them,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="88"> </a></span> and appreciate them as I do; but
                              that is another story. She has been working at this new book all winter with a fervour
                              and
                              concentration which her isolation has helped to bring about. She owes a debt of gratitude
                              to her
                              surroundings, and some day I shall tell her so.”

                           <p id="d75437e2991">“She is passionate, there is no doubt. She nearly fell on us both this afternoon.
                              She is too much
                              swayed by every little incident. Everything makes a vivid impression on her and shakes
                              her to
                              pieces. It is rather absurd and disproportionate now, like the long legs of a foal,
                              but it is a
                              sign of growth. My experience is that people without that fire of enthusiasm on the
                              one side and
                              righteous indignation on the other never achieve anything except in domestic life.
                              If Hester
                              lives she will outgrow her passionate nature, or at least she will grow up to it and
                              become
                              passive, contemplative. Then instead of unbalanced anger and excitement, the same
                              nature which
                              is now continually upset by them will have learnt to receive impressions calmly, and,
                              by reason
                              of that receptiveness and insight, she will go far.”

                              all on
                              presents for 
                              <sic id="d75437e3021">Fraülein</sic>, whose birthday was on the morrow. After Mary's tiny white bone
                              umbrella had been discovered to be a needle-case, and most of the needles had been
                              recovered
                              from the floor, Regie extracted from its paper a little china cow. But, alas! the
                              cow's ears and
                              horns remained in the bag, owing possibly to the incessant passage of the parcel from
                              one pocket
                              to another on the way home. Regie looked at the remnants in the bag and his lip quivered,
                              while
                              Mary, her own umbrella safely warehoused, exclaimed, “Oh! Regie” in tones of piercing
                              reproach.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3025">But Hester quickly suggested that she could put them on again quite easily, and
                              
                              <sic id="d75437e3027">Fraülein</sic> would like it just as much. Still it was a blow. Regie leaned his head
                              against Hester's shoulder.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3032">Hester pressed her cheek against his little dark head. Sybell Loftus had often told
                              Hester that
                              she could have no idea of the happiness of a child's touch till she was a mother:
                              that she
                              herself had not an inkling till then. But perhaps some poor substitute for that exquisite
                              feeling was vouchsafed to Hester.

                           <p id="d75437e3037">“The tail is still on,” she whispered, not too cheerfully, but as one who in darkness
                              sees light
                              beyond.

                           <p id="d75437e3043">“When I bought it,” said Regie, in a strangled voice, “and it was a great deal of
                              money cow, I
                              did wish its tail had been out behind; but I think now it is safer like that.”

                              when you
                              are dressed, run up to my room, and you will find it just like it was before.” And
                              she carefully
                              put aside the bits with the injured animal.

                           <p id="d75437e3053">Stella produced a bag of “bull's-eyes” which, in striking contrast with the cow, had,

                              course of the drive home, cohered so tightly together that it was doubtful if they
                              would ever be
                              separated again.

                              circle of white rims with a nucleus of coventry frilling, with two pink legs kicking
                              gently
                              upwards, were visible.

                              conventional years we find a poor equivalent for marking our disapproval by changing
                              the

                              boots.

                              crimsoned by the act of stooping, and by the obduracy of the dust-ingrained bootlaces.
                              But as
                              she looked she noticed the flushed cheeks, and being a diviner of spirits, wondered
                              what Hester
                              was ashamed of now.

                           <p id="d75437e3093">As Hester rose her sister-in-law held out, with momentary hesitation, a thin paper
                              bag, in which
                              an oval form allowed its moist presence to be discerned by partial adhesion to its
                              envelope.

                              We never
                              get so far as the drawing-room. Our conquests, our self-denials are achieved through
                              the medium
                              of suet and lard and necks of mutton. We wrestle with the dripping, and rise on
                              stepping-stones—not of our dead selves, but of sheep and oxen—to higher things.

                              that—who, in Mrs. Gresley's ideas, knew none of the real difficulties of life, its

                              bills, its monthly nurses, its constant watchfulness over delicate children, its long,

                              strain at two ends which won't meet. We must know but little of our fellow creatures

                              sole in the bag appears to us other than the outward and homely sign of an inward
                              and spiritual
                              conquest.

                              and put Emma away in silence.

                              instead
                              of listlessly outstretched, her eyes ominously fixed on the tea-table and seed cake.

                              never so much as asked for the silver teapot.”

                              alter the habit
                              of a lifetime, and to remember to dash out and hurriedly change the daily routine
                              if visitors
                              were present. Lady Susan had always used her battered old silver teapot every day,
                              and for the
                              life of her Hester could not understand why there should be one kind one day and one
                              kind
                              another. She glanced resentfully at the little brown earthenware vessel which she
                              had wielded so
                              cheerfully half an hour ago. Why did she never remember the Gresleys' wishes?

                           <p id="d75437e3136">“Hester,” said Mrs. Gresley suddenly, taking new note of Hester's immaculate brown
                              holland gown,
                              which contrasted painfully with her own dilapidated pink shirt with hard collars and
                              cuffs and
                              imitation tie, tied for life in the shop where it was born. “You are so smart; I do
                              believe you
                              knew they were coming.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3139">If there was one thing more than another which offended Hester, it was being told
                              that she was

                           <p id="d75437e3145">“I trust I am never smart,” she replied; not with any touch of the haughtiness that
                              some ignorant
                              persons believe to be<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="93"> </a></span> the grand manner, but with a subtle
                              change of tone and carriage which seemed instantly to remove her to an enormous distance
                              from
                              the other woman with her insinuation and tan stockings. Mrs. Gresley unconsciously
                              drew in her
                              feet. “I did not know when I dressed this morning that the Bishop was coming to-day.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3150">“Then you 
                              <emph id="d75437e3152">did</emph> know later that he was coming?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3157">“Yes, Rachel West wrote to tell me so this morning, but I did not open her letter
                              at breakfast,
                              and I was so vexed at being late for luncheon that I forgot to mention it then. I
                              remembered as
                              soon as James had started and ran after him, but he was too far off to hear me call
                              to him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3160">It cost Hester a good deal to give this explanation, as she was aware that the Bishop's
                              visit had
                              been to her and to her alone.

                           <p id="d75437e3163">“Come, come,” said Mr. Gresley, judicially, with the natural masculine abhorrence
                              of a feminine
                              skirmish. “Don't go on making foolish excuses, Hester, which deceive no one; and you,
                              Minna,
                              don't criticise Hester's clothes. It is the Bishop's own fault for not writing his
                              notes
                              himself. He might have known that Miss West would have written to Hester instead of
                              to me. I
                              can't say I think Hester behaved kindly towards us in acting as she did, but I won't
                              hear any
                              more argument about it. I desire the subject should now DROP.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3166">The last words were uttered in the same tone in which Mr. Gresley closed morning service,
                              and
                              were felt to be final. He was not in reality greatly chagrined at missing the Bishop,
                              whom he
                              regarded with some of the suspicious distrust with which a certain class of mind ever
                              regards
                              that which is superior to it. Hester left the room, closing the door gently behind
                              her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3169">“James,” said Mrs. Gresley, looking at her priest with tears of admiration in her
                              eyes, “I shall
                              never be good like you, so you need not expect it. How you can be so generous and
                              patient with
                              her I don't know. It passes me.”

                              Gresley, in his most affectionate cornet, drawing his tired, tearful little wife down
                              beside him
                              on the sofa. And he made some fresh tea for her, and waited on her, and she told him
                              about the
                              children's boots and the sole, and he told her about a remarkable speech he had made
                              at the
                              chapter meeting, and a feeling that had been borne in on him on the way home that
                              he should
                              shortly write something striking about Apostolic Succession. And they were happy together;
                              for
                              though he sometimes reproved her as a priest if she allowed herself to dwell on the
                              probability
                              of his being made a Bishop, he was very kind to her as a husband.

                           <p id="d75437e3226">On his bicycle on the smooth shaven lawn was Dick wheeling slowly in and out among
                              the
                              stone-edged flower-beds, an apricot in each broad palm, while he discoursed in a dispassionate
                              manner to the two excited little boys who were making futile rushes for the apricots.
                              The
                              governess and Rachel were looking on. Rachel had arrived at Westhope the day before
                              from
                              Southminster. “Take your time, my son,” said Dick, just eluding by a hairsbreadth
                              a charge
                              through a geranium bed on the part of the eldest boy. “If you are such jolly little
                              fools as to
                              crack your little skulls on the sun-dial I shall eat them both myself. Miss Turner
                              says you may
                              have them, so you've only got to take them. I can't keep on offering them all day
                              long. My time”
                              (Dick ran his bicycle up a terrace, and as soon as the boys were up, glided down again)
                              “my time
                              is valuable. You don't want them?” A shrill disclaimer and a fresh onslaught. “Miss
                              Turner, they
                              thank you very much, but they don't care for apricots.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3229">Half a second more and Dick skilfully parted from his bicycle and was charged by his
                              two admirers
                              and severely pummelled as high as they could reach. When they had been led away by
                              Miss Turner,
                              each biting an apricot and casting longing backward looks at their friend, Rachel
                              and Dick
                              wandered to the north side of the abbey and sat down there in the shade.

                           <p id="d75437e3232">Lord Newhaven could still see them, could still note her amused face under her wide
                              white hat. He
                              was doing his best for Dick, and Dick was certainly having his chance, and making
                              the most of it
                              according to his lights.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3235">“But all the same I don't think he has a chance,” said Lord Newhaven to himself. “That
                              woman, in
                              spite of her frank manner and her self-possession, is afraid of men; not of being
                              married for
                              her money, but of man himself. And whatever else he may not be, Dick is a man. It's
                              the best
                              chance she will ever get, so it is probable she won't take it.”

                              ground-floor. He sat down at his writing-table and took out of his pocket a letter
                              which he had
                              evidently read before. He now read it slowly once more.

                              properly closed. As you wrote on business, I wish you would be more careful.”

                              envelope, addressed and stamped it, and sauntered out through the low-arched door
                              into the
                              garden.

                           <p id="d75437e3250">Dick was sitting alone on the high-carved stone edge of the round pool where the monks
                              used to
                              wash, and where gold-fish now lived cloistered lives. A moment of depression seemed
                              to have
                              overtaken that cheerful personage.

                           <p id="d75437e3256">Dick gathered himself together, and rose slowly to his large feet.</p>

                              It's like

                              of a

                              “It is the first reform that I shall bring about.” And he nodded to the smiling apologetic
                              man
                              and trotted on, Dick beside him, who was apparently absorbed in the action of his

                              fond mother of those two “jolly little chaps,” should have been guilty of an underhand
                              trick,
                              was astonishing to him.

                              the roan cob. For unfortunately the kind of man who has what are called “illusions”
                              about women,
                              is too often the man whose discrimination lies in other directions, in fields where

                              observed that Lady Newhaven had somehow slipped off the pedestal, and that she, Rachel,

                              confidant of Lady Newhaven's secret, and had taken refuge with that friend of all
                              perplexed
                              souls the Bishop of Southminster. She felt unable to meet Hugh again without an interval
                              of
                              breathing time. She knew that if she saw much more of him he would confide in her,
                              and she
                              shrank from receiving a confidence the ugliest fact of which she already knew. Perhaps
                              she
                              involuntarily shrank also from fear lest he should lower himself in her eyes by only
                              telling her
                              half the truth. Sad confessions were often poured into Rachel's ears which she had
                              known for
                              years. She never alluded to that knowledge, never corrected the half-lie which accompanies
                              so
                              many whispered self-accusations. Confidences and confessions are too often a means
                              of evasion of
                              justice, a laying of the case for the plaintiff before a judge without allowing the
                              defendant to
                              be present or to call a witness. Rachel, by dint of long experience, which did slowly
                              for her
                              the work of imagination, had ceased to wonder at the faithfully chronicled harsh words
                              and deeds
                              of generous souls. She knew or guessed at the unchronicled treachery or deceit which
                              had brought
                              about that seemingly harsh word or deed.

                           <p id="d75437e3383">She had not the exalted ideas about her fellow creatures which Hester had, but she
                              possessed the
                              rare gift of reticence. She exemplified the text—“Whether it be to friend or foe,
                              talk not of
                              other men's lives.” And in Rachel's quiet soul a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="103"> </a></span> vast love and
                              pity dwelt for these same fellow creatures. She had lived and worked for years among
                              those whose
                              bodies were half starved, half clothed, degraded. When she found money at her command
                              she had
                              spent sums (as her lawyer told her) out of all proportion on that poor human body,
                              stumbling
                              between vice and starvation. But now, during the last year, when her great wealth
                              had thrown her
                              violently into society, she had met, until her strong heart flinched before it, the
                              other side
                              of life: the starved soul in the delicately nurtured, richly clad body, the atrophied
                              spiritual
                              life in hideous contrast with the physical ease and luxury which were choking it.
                              The second
                              experience was harder to bear than the first. And just as in the old days she had
                              shared her
                              bread and cheese with those hungrier than herself, and had taken but little thought
                              for those
                              who had bread and to spare, so now she felt but transient interest in those among
                              her new
                              associates who were successfully struggling against the blackmail of luxury, the leprosy
                              of
                              worldliness, the selfishness that at last coffins the soul it clothes. Her heart yearned
                              instead
                              towards the spiritually starving, the tempted, the fallen in that great little world,
                              whose
                              names are written in the book, not of life, but of Burke—the little world which is
                              called
                              “Society.”

                              mean care
                              from their faces. But it had been far simpler in her previous life to share her hard-earned
                              bread with those who needed it than it was now to share her equally hard-earned thoughts
                              and
                              slow gleanings of spiritual knowledge, to share the things which belonged to her peace.

                              was an ugly fortification round it of defaced, fire-seared stones which had once stood

                              minaret and tower, and which now served only as a defence against all comers.

                              which had made his crooked mouth shut so firmly, Rachel might possibly have been able
                              to give
                              him something more valuable than the paper money of her friendship. But Dick was obviously
                              independent. He could do without her, while Hugh had a claim upon her. Rachel's thoughts
                              turned
                              to Hugh again and ever again. Did he see his conduct as she saw it? A haunting fear
                              was upon her
                              that he did not. And she longed with an intensity that outbalanced for the time every

                              feeling that he should confess his sin fully, entirely—see it in all its ugliness
                              and gather
                              himself together into a deep repentance before he went down into silence, or before
                              he made a
                              fresh start in life. She would have given her right hand to achieve that.

                              tender compassion which Rachel felt for her, and used it to the uttermost, but unfortunately
                              she
                              mistook it for admiration of her character, mixed with sympathetic sorrow for her
                              broken heart.
                              If she had seen herself as Rachel saw her she would have conceived, not for herself

                              you away from me,” she said plaintively to Rachel one morning, when she made the disagreeable
                              discovery that Rachel and Hester were friends. “I don't care much about her myself,
                              she is so
                              profane, and so dreadfully irreligious. But Edward likes to talk to her. He prefers
                              artificial
                              people. I wonder he did not marry her. That old cat, Lady Susan Gresley, was always
                              throwing her
                              at his head. I wish she was not always persuading you to leave me for hours together.
                              I get so
                              frightened when I am left alone with Edward. I live in perpetual dread that he will
                              say
                              something before the children or the servants. He is quite cruel enough.”

                              and under the sycamore, with a bench round it, the dolls had a tea-party. Hester had

                           <p id="d75437e3518">“We can't leave the bicycles outside though,” said Dick, and he took a good look at
                              the heavy
                              padlocked gate. Then he slowly lifted it off its hinges, wheeled in the bicycles,
                              and replaced
                              the gate in position.

                           <p id="d75437e3521">Rachel looked at him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3524">“Do you always do what you want to do?” she said involuntarily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3527">“It saves trouble,” he said, “especially as no one can be such a first-class fool
                              as to think a
                              padlock will keep a gate shut. He would expect it to be opened.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3531">“But father said no one could come in there now,” explained Regie, who had watched
                              open-mouthed
                              the upheaval of the gate. “Father said it could not be opened any more. He told mother.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3534">“Did he, my son?” said Dick, and he kissed every one, beginning with Hester, and finishing
                              with
                              the dolls. Then they all sat down to the tea-party, and partook largely of the delicacies,
                              and
                              after tea Dick solemnly asked the children if they had seen the flying halfpenny he
                              had brought
                              back with him from Australia. The children crowded round him, and the halfpenny was
                              produced and
                              handed round. Each child touched it and found it real. Auntie Hester and Auntie Rachel
                              examined
                              it. Boulou was requested to smell it. And then it was laid on the grass, and the
                              pocket-handkerchief which had done duty as a tablecloth was spread over it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3537">The migrations of the halfpenny were so extraordinary that even Rachel and Hester
                              professed
                              amazement. Once it was found in Rachel's hand, into which another large hand had gently
                              shut it.
                              But it was never discovered twice in the same place, though all the children rushed
                              religiously
                              to look for it where it was last discovered.

                           <p id="d75437e3540">Another time, after a long search, the doll in the bath was discovered to be sitting
                              upon it, and
                              once it actually flew down Regie's back, and amid the wild excitement of the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="111" data-tei-n="110"> </a></span> children its cold descent was described by Regie in piercing
                              minuteness until the moment when it rolled out over his stocking at his knee.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3545">“Make it fly down my back too, Uncle Dick,” shrieked Mary. “Regie, give it to me.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3548">But Regie danced in a circle round Dick, holding aloft the wonderful halfpenny.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3552">“Make it fly down my throat,” he cried, too excited to know what he was doing, and
                              he put the
                              halfpenny in his mouth.

                           <p id="d75437e3558">A moment's pause followed, in which the blood ebbed away from the hearts of the two

                              rolled on
                              the grass screaming.

                              him
                              violently.

                              intently.

                           <p id="d75437e3580">“It's going down,” screamed Regie, suddenly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3583">“That it's not,” said Dick, and he shook the child again, and the halfpenny flew out
                              upon the
                              grass.

                              slipped off Hester's knee, and ran to Dick, who was lying on the grass a few paces
                              off, his face
                              hidden in his hands.

                              And
                              she sat down near the prostrate vinegrower. The president of the South Australian

                              is always
                              termed “queenly.” She “kept the men at a distance.” She “never allowed them to take
                              liberties,”
                              &amp;c. &amp;c. She held her chin up and her elbows out, and was considered by the section
                              of
                              Middleshire society in which she shone to be very distinguished. Mrs. Pratt was often
                              told that
                              her daughter looked like a duchess; and this facsimile of the aristocracy, or rather
                              of the most
                              distressing traits of its latest recruits, had a manner of lolling with crossed legs
                              in the
                              parental carriage and pair, which was greatly admired. “Looks as if she was born to
                              it all,” Mr.
                              Pratt would say to his wife.

                              won't make friends with everybody, and she gives it me (with maternal pride) when

                              high
                              breeding obliged her to be rather peremptory with her simple parent. “Mr. Vernon is
                              a pauper,
                              and so is Hessie. And besides Hessie is not the kind of girl that anybody would want
                              to
                              marry.”

                              have told me because I told her all about Captain Cobbett and Mr. Baxter.”

                              Hear both sides, that is what I always say. The Bishop constantly enjoins on his clergy
                              to
                              endeavour to elicit the lay opinion. The chair this evening will be taken by Mr. Pratt,
                              a
                              layman.”

                           <p id="d75437e3793">The temperance meeting was to take place at seven o'clock, and possibly Rachel may
                              have been
                              biased in favour of that entertainment by the hope of a quiet half-hour with Hester
                              in her own
                              room. At any rate, she secured it.

                           <p id="d75437e3797">When they were alone Rachel produced Lady Newhaven's note.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3800">“Do come to Westhope,” she said. “While you are under this roof it seems almost impossible
                              to see
                              you, unless we are close to it,” and she touched the sloping ceiling with her hand.
                              “And yet I
                              came to Westhope, and I am going on to Wilderleigh partly in order to be near you.”

                           <p id="d75437e3806">“The book is nearly finished,” she said, the low light from the attic window striking
                              sideways on
                              the small face with its tightly compressed lips.

                           <p id="d75437e3809">A spirit indomitable, immortal, looked for a moment out of Hester's grey eyes. The
                              spirit was
                              indeed willing, but the flesh was becoming weaker day by day.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3812">“When it is finished,” she went on, “I will go anywhere and do anything, but stay
                              here I must
                              till it is done. Besides, I am not fit for society at present. I am covered with blue
                              mould. Do
                              you remember how that horrid Lady Carbury used to laugh at the country squires' daughters
                              for
                              being provincial? I have gone a peg lower than being provincial, I have become parochial.”

                              could only just see the white figure of Regie sitting up in his nightgown. She sat
                              down on the
                              edge of the bed and took him in her arms.

                              the sleeping
                              angel in the next crib, who was only Mary by day. “But you must never do it again,

                              tell mother all about it to-morrow.”

                           <p id="d75437e3859">“Uncle Dick did say it was a flying halfpenny, and you said so, too, and that other

                              thought it did not matter putting in flying halfpennies, only common ones.”

                           <p id="d75437e3862">Hester saw the difficulty in Regie's mind. “It felt common when it was inside,” said
                              Regie
                              doubtfully, “and yet you and Uncle Dick 
                              <emph id="d75437e3864">did</emph> say it was a flying one.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3868">Regie's large eyes were turned upon her with solemn inquiry in them. It is in crises
                              like this
                              that our first ideals are laid low.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3871">Regie had always considered Hester as the very soul of honour, that mysterious honour
                              which he
                              was beginning to dimly apprehend through her allegiance to it, and which, in his mind,
                              belonged
                              as exclusively to her as the little bedroom under the roof.

                           <p id="d75437e3876">“Regie,” said Hester, tremulously, seeing that she had unwittingly put a stumbling-block
                              before
                              the little white feet she loved, “when we played at the doll's tea-party, and you
                              were the
                              butler, I did not mean you were

                              we all knew, that you were Regie all the time.”

                           <p id="d75437e3886">“It was a game. And so when Uncle Dick found us playing the tea-party game he played
                              another game
                              about the flying halfpenny.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3889">“Then it was a common halfpenny after all,” said Regie with a deep sigh.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3892">“Yes, it was a common halfpenny, only the game was that it could fly, like the other
                              game was
                              that the acorn-cups were real tea-cups. So Uncle Dick and all of us were not saying
                              what was not
                              true. We were all playing at a game. Do you understand, my little mouse?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3895">“Yes,” said Regie, with another voluminous sigh, and Hester realised with thankfulness
                              that the
                              halfpenny and not herself had fallen from its pedestal. “I see now, but when he said,
                              Hi!
                              Presto! and it flew away, I thought I saw it flying. Mary said she did. And I suppose
                              the gate
                              was only a game too.”

                           <p id="d75437e3898">Hester felt that the subject would be quite beyond her powers of explanation if once
                              the gate
                              were introduced into it.

                           <p id="d75437e3902">She laid Regie down and covered him.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e3908">“Yes,” said Regie dejectedly. “I'd rather know what there is to be known. Only I
                              
                              <emph id="d75437e3910">thought</emph> it was a flying one. Good night, Auntie Hester.”

                           <p id="d75437e3914">She stayed beside him a few minutes until his even breathing showed her he was asleep,
                              and then
                              slipped back to her own room. The front door bell was ringing as she came out of the
                              nursery.
                              The temperance deputation from Liverpool had<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="120" data-tei-n="119"> </a></span> arrived. Mr.
                              Gresley's voice of welcome could be heard saying that it was only ten minutes to seven.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3919">Accordingly a few minutes before that hour, Mr. Gresley and his party entered the
                              parish room. It
                              was crammed. The back benches were filled with a large contingent of young men, whose
                              half-sheepish, half-sullen expression showed that their presence was due to pressure.
                              Why the
                              parishioners had come in such numbers it would be hard to say. Perhaps even a temperance
                              meeting
                              was a change in the dreary monotony of rural life at Warpington. Many of the faces
                              bore the
                              imprint of this monotony, Rachel thought, as she refused the conspicuous front seat
                              pointed out
                              to her by Mrs. Gresley, and sat down near the door with Hester.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3922">Dick, who had been finishing his cigarette outside, entered a moment later, and stood
                              in the
                              gangway, entirely filling it up, his eye travelling over the assembly, and as Rachel
                              well knew,
                              looking for her. Presently he caught sight of her, wedged in four or five deep by
                              the last
                              arrivals. There was a vacant space between her and the wall, but it was apparently
                              inaccessible.
                              Entirely disregarding the anxious churchwardens who were waving him forward Dick disappeared
                              among the young men at the back, and Rachel thought no more of him until a large Oxford
                              shoe
                              descended quietly out of space upon the empty seat near her, and Dick, who had persuaded

                              young men to give him footroom on their seats, and had stepped over the high backs
                              of several
                              “school forms,” sat down beside her.

                           <p id="d75437e3926">It was neatly done, and Rachel could not help smiling. But the thought darted through
                              her mind
                              that Dick was the kind of man who somehow or other would succeed where he meant to
                              succeed, and
                              would marry the woman he intended to marry. There was no doubt that she was that woman,
                              and as
                              he sat tranquilly beside her she wished with a nervous tremor that his choice had
                              fallen on some
                              one else.

                           <p id="d75437e3929">The meeting opened with nasal and fervent prayer on the part of a neighbouring Archdeacon.
                              No one
                              could kneel down<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="120"> </a></span> except the dignitaries on the platform, but
                              every one pretended to do so. Mr. Pratt, who was in the chair, then introduced the
                              principal
                              speaker. Mr. Pratt's face, very narrow at the forehead, became slightly wider at the
                              eyes,
                              widest when it reached round the corners of the mouth, and finally split into two
                              long
                              parti-coloured whiskers. He assumed on these occasions a manner of pontifical solemnity
                              towards
                              his “humble brethren,” admirably suited to one, who after wrestling for many years
                              with a patent
                              oil, is conscious that he has blossomed out into a “county family.”

                           <p id="d75437e3937">The deputation from Liverpool followed, a thin ascetic looking man of many bones and
                              little
                              linen, who spoke with the concentrated fury of a fanatic against alcohol in all its
                              varieties.
                              Dick who had so far taken more interest in Rachel's gloves, which she had dropped,
                              and with
                              which he was kindly burdening himself, than in the proceedings, drew himself up and
                              fixed his
                              steel eyes on the speaker.

                           <p id="d75437e3940">A restive movement in the audience followed the speech, which was loudly clapped by
                              Mr. Gresley
                              and the Pratts.

                           <p id="d75437e3943">Mr. Gresley then mounted the platform.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3947">Mr. Gresley had an enormous advantage as a platform speaker, and as a preacher in
                              the twin
                              pulpits of church and home, owing to the conviction that he had penetrated to the
                              core of any
                              subject under discussion, and could pronounce judgment upon it in a conclusive manner.
                              He was
                              wont to approach every subject by the preliminary statement that he had “threshed
                              it out.” This
                              threshing out had been so thorough that there was hardly a subject even of the knottiest
                              description which he was unable to dismiss with a few pregnant words. “Evolution!
                              Ha! ha!!
                              Descended from an ape. I don't believe that for one.” While women's rights received
                              their
                              death-blow from a jocose allusion to the woman following the plough, while the man
                              sat at home
                              and rocked the cradle.

                           <p id="d75437e3950">With the same noble simplicity he grappled with the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="121"> </a></span> difficult
                              and complex subject of temperance, by which he meant total abstinence. He informed
                              his hearers,
                              “in the bigoted tones of a married teetotaler,” that he had gone to the root of the
                              matter—the
                              roots were apparently on the surface—and that it was no use calling black white and
                              white black.
                              He for one did not believe in muddling up black and white as some lukewarm people
                              advocated till
                              they were only a dirty grey. No; either drink was right or it was wrong. If it was
                              not wrong to
                              get drunk, he did not know what was wrong. He was not a man of compromise. Alcohol
                              was a servant
                              of the devil, and to tamper with it was to tamper with the evil one himself; touch
                              not; taste
                              not; handle not. He for his part should never side with the devil.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3955">This lofty utterance having been given time to sink in, Mr. Gresley looked round at
                              the sea of
                              stolid, sullen faces, and concluded with saying that the chairman would now call upon
                              his
                              cousin, Mr. Vernon, to speak to them on the shocking evils he himself had witnessed
                              in Australia
                              as the results of drink.

                           <p id="d75437e3958">Dick was not troubled by shyness. He extricated himself from his seat with the help
                              of the young
                              men, and slowly ascended the platform. He looked a size too large for it, and for
                              the other
                              speakers, and his loose tweed suit and heather stockings were as great a contrast
                              to the tightly
                              buttoned up black of the other occupants as were his strong keen face and muscular
                              hands to
                              those of the previous speakers.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3961">“That's a man,” said a masculine voice behind Rachel. “He worn't reared on ditch water,
                              you
                              bet.”

                           <p id="d75437e3964">“Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen,” said Dick, “You've only got to listen to
                              me for half a
                              minute, and you'll find out without my telling you that Nature did not cut me out
                              for a speaker.
                              I'm no talker. I'm a working man”—an admission which Mr. Pratt would rather have been
                              boiled in
                              his own oil than have made—“for the last seven years I've done my twelve hours a day,
                              and I've
                              come to think more of what a man gets through with his hands than the sentiments which
                              he can
                              wheeze out after a heavy meal. But Mr. Gresley<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="123" data-tei-n="122"> </a></span> has asked me to
                              tell you what I know about drink, as I have seen a good many samples of it in Australia.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3970">Dick then proceeded, with a sublime disregard of grammar, and an earnestness that
                              increased as he
                              went on, to dilate on the evil effects of drink as he himself had witnessed them.
                              He described
                              how he had seen men who could not get spirits make themselves drunk on “Pain-killer”;
                              how he had
                              seen strong young station hands, who had not tasted spirits for months, come down
                              from the hills
                              with a hundred pounds in their pockets, and drink themselves into “doddery” old men
                              in a
                              fortnight in the nearest township, where they were kept drunk on drugged liquor till
                              all their
                              hard-earned wages were gone.

                           <p id="d75437e3973">The whole room listened in dead silence. No feet shuffled. Mr. Gresley looked patronisingly
                              at
                              Dick's splendid figure and large outstretched hand, with the crooked middle finger
                              which he had
                              cut off by mistake in the Bush, and had stuck on again himself. Then the young Vicar
                              glanced
                              smiling at the audience, feeling that he had indeed elicited a “lay opinion” of the
                              best
                              kind.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e3976">“Now what are the causes of all these dreadful things?” continued Dick. “I'm speaking
                              to the men
                              here, not the women. What are the causes of all this poverty and vice and scamped
                              workmanship,
                              and weak eyes and shaky hands on the top of high wages? I tell you they come from
                              two things,
                              and one is as bad as the other. One is drinking too much, and the other is drinking
                              bad liquor.
                              Every man who's worth his salt,” said Dick, balancing his long bent finger on the
                              middle of his
                              other palm, “should know when he has had enough. Some can carry more, some less.”
                              Mr. Gresley
                              started and signed to Dick, but Dick did not notice. “Bad liquor is at the root of
                              half the
                              drunkenness I know. I don't suppose there are many publicans here to-night, for this
                              meeting
                              isn't quite in their line, and if there are, they can't have come expecting compliments.
                              But if
                              you fellows think you get good liquor at the publics round here, I tell you, you are
                              jolly well
                              mistaken.”

                              a

                              was
                              restored. “Total abstinence is a long chalk below temperance, but it's better than
                              drunkenness
                              any day. And if a man can't get on without three finger-nips let him take the pledge.
                              There are
                              one or two here to-night who would be the better for it. But to my thinking total
                              abstinence is
                              like a water mattress. It is good for a sick man, and it's good for a man with a weak
                              will,
                              which is another kind of illness. But temperance is for those who are in health. There
                              is a text
                              in the Bible about wine making glad the heart of man. That's a good text and one to
                              go on. As
                              often as not texts are like bags, and a man crams all his own rubbish into them, and
                              expects you
                              to take them together. There are some men who ought to know better<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="125" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span> who actually get out of that text by saying the Bible means
                              unfermented liquor”—Mr. Gresley became purple. “Does it? Then how about the other
                              place where we
                              hear of new wine bursting old bottles. What makes them burst? Fermentation, of course,
                              as every
                              village idiot knows. No, I take it when the Bible says wine it means wine. Wine's
                              fermented
                              liquor, and what's unfermented liquor? Nothing but ‘pop’.”

                           <p id="d75437e4012">Dick pronounced the last word with profound contempt, which was met with enthusiastic
                              applause.

                           <p id="d75437e4015">“My last word to you, gentlemen,” continued Dick, “is keep in mind two points: first,
                              look out
                              for an honest publican, if there is such an article, who will buy only the best liquor
                              from the
                              best sources, and is not bound by the breweries to sell any stuff they send along.

                              together, and make it hot for a bound publican. Kick him out, even if he is the Squire's
                              butler.” Mr. Pratt's complexion became apoplectic. “And the second point is, Remember
                              some men
                              have heads and some haven't. It is no use for a lame man entering for a hurdle race.
                              A strong
                              man can take his whack—if it's with his food—and it will do him good, while a weak
                              man can't
                              hang up his hat after the first smile.”

                           <p id="d75437e4018">A storm of applause followed, which was perhaps all the heartier by dafsreason of
                              the furious
                              face of Mr. Gresley. Dick was clapped continuously as he descended the platform, and
                              slowly left
                              the room feeling in his pockets for his tobacco pouch. A squad of young men creaked
                              out after
                              him, and others followed by twos and threes, so that the mellifluous voice of Mr.
                              Pratt was
                              comparatively lost, who, disregarding his position as chairman, now rose to pour oil—of
                              which in
                              manner alone he had always a large supply—on the troubled waters. Mr. Pratt had felt
                              a
                              difficulty in interrupting a member of a county family, which with the eye of faith
                              he plainly
                              perceived Dick to be, and at the same time a guest of “Newhaven's.” The Pratts experienced
                              in
                              the rare moments of their intercourse with the Newhavens some of that sublime awe,
                              that subdued
                              rapture, which others experience in

                              in the defeat of Mr. Gresley, who did not pay him the deference which he considered
                              due to him
                              and his “seat.” Mr. Pratt always expected that the Vicar should, by reason of his
                              small income,
                              take the position of a sort of upper servant of the Squire; and he had seen so many
                              instances of
                              this happy state of things that he was perpetually nettled by Mr. Gresley's “independent”
                              attitude; while Mr. Gresley was equally irritated by “the impatience of clerical control”
                              and
                              shepherding which Mr. Pratt, his largest and woolliest sheep, too frequently evinced.

                              which came
                              from the school playground. And when a few minutes later Rachel emerged with the stream

                              youths and
                              men. The laughter had ceased. Their crestfallen appearance spoke for itself.

                              and Hester at the gate.

                              that fetched 'em all most wasn't his saying that since he's been in a hot climate
                              he knowed what
                              it was to be tempted himself when he was a bit down on his luck or a bit up. Pratts
                              would never
                              have owned to that.” The village always spoke of Mr. Pratt in the plural without a
                              prefix. “I've
                              been to a sight of temperance meetings because,” with indulgence, “master likes it,
                              tho' I
                              always has my glass, as is natural. But I never heard one of the speakers kind of
                              settle to it
                              like that. That's what the folks say; that for all he was a born gentleman he spoke
                              to 'em as
                              man to man, not as if we was servants or childer.”

                              Lord Newhaven, strolling into the dining-room at Westhope Abbey, where Rachel and
                              Dick were
                              sitting at a little supper-table laid for two in front of the high altar. The dining-room
                              had
                              formerly been the chapel, and the carved stone altar still remained under the east
                              window.

                           <p id="d75437e4124">Lord Newhaven drew up a chair, and Rachel felt vaguely relieved at his presence. He
                              had a knack
                              of knowing when to appear, and when to efface himself.

                           <p id="d75437e4131">“Her first book was very clever,” said Lord Newhaven, “and what was more, it was true.
                              I hope for
                              her own sake she will outgrow her love of truth, or it will make deadly enemies for
                              her.”

                           <p id="d75437e4137">“Possibly,” said Lord Newhaven, looking narrowly at her, and almost obliged to believe
                              that she
                              had spoken without self-consciousness. “But if she outgrows all her principles, I
                              hope at any
                              rate she won't outgrow her sharp tongue. I liked her ever since she first came to
                              this house,
                              ten years ago, with Lady Susan Gresley. I remember saying that Captain Pratt, who
                              called while
                              she was here, was a ‘bounder.’ And Miss Gresley said she did not think he was quite
                              a
                              bounder,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="130" data-tei-n="129"> </a></span> only on the boundary line. If you knew Captain
                              Pratt, that describes him exactly.”

                           <p id="d75437e4142">“I wish she had not said it,” said Rachel with a sigh. “She makes trouble for herself
                              by saying
                              things like that. Is Lady Newhaven in the drawing-room?”

                           <p id="d75437e4152">“I do believe,” said Lord Newhaven, when Rachel had departed, “that she has an affection
                              for Miss
                              Gresley.”

                           <p id="d75437e4158">“No. It generally needs to be a magnifying glass to see a woman's friendship, and

                              only expedients till we arrive, Dick. You need not be jealous of Miss Gresley. Miss
                              West will

                              forwarder than I was.”

                              ought
                              to.”

                              themselves for love, none greater, and they will marry for love. But their different

                              you will receive business letters, requiring your immediate presence in London. You
                              are not

                              book and
                              lie, if you think it is the right thing. But I expect she will know very well that
                              the same
                              business which took me to that infernal temperance meeting has taken me to London.”

                           <p id="d75437e4235">Rachel was vaguely relieved when Dick went off next morning. She was not, as a rule,
                              oppressed by
                              the attentions she received from young men, which in due season became “marked,” and
                              then
                              resulted in proposals neatly or clumsily expressed. But she was disturbed when she
                              thought of
                              Dick, and his departure was like the removal of a weight, not a heavy, but still a
                              perceptible
                              one. For Rachel was aware that Dick was in deadly earnest, and that his love was growing
                              steadily, almost unconsciously, was accumulating like snow, flake by flake, upon a
                              mountain-side. Some day, perhaps not for a long time, but some day, there would be
                              an avalanche,
                              and, in his own language, she “would be in it.”

                              Hester had so unfortunately fallen asleep on a previous occasion. It was the first
                              of many
                              clandestine meetings. Mr. and Mrs. Gresley did not realise that Hester and Rachel
                              wished to
                              “talk secrets,” as they would have expressed it, and Rachel's arrival was felt by
                              the Gresleys
                              to be the appropriate moment to momentarily lay aside their daily avocations, and
                              to join Hester
                              and Rachel in the garden for social intercourse. The Gresleys liked Rachel. Listeners
                              are
                              generally liked. Perhaps also her gentle, unassuming manner was not an unpleasant
                              change after
                              the familiar nonchalance of the Pratts.

                           <p id="d75437e4266">The two friends bore their fate for a time in inward impatience, and then, not without
                              compunction, “practised to deceive.” Certain obtuse persons push others, naturally
                              upright, into
                              eluding and outwitting them, just as the really wicked people, who give 
                              <foreign id="d75437e4268" xml:lang="lat">vivâ voce</foreign> invitations, goad us into crevasses of lies, for which, if there is any
                              justice anywhere, they will have to answer at the last day. Mr. Gresley gave the last
                              shove to
                              Hester and Rachel by an exhaustive harangue on what he called socialism. Finding they
                              were
                              discussing some phase of it, he drew up a chair and informed them that he had “threshed
                              out” the
                              whole subject.

                           <p id="d75437e4275">“Socialism,” he began, delighted with the polite resignation of his hearers, which
                              throughout
                              life he mistook for earnest attention. “Community of goods. People don't see that
                              if everything
                              were divided up to-day, and everybody was given a shilling, by next week the thrifty
                              man would
                              have a sovereign, and the spendthrift would be penniless. Community of goods is impossible
                              as
                              long as human nature remains what it is. But I can't knock that into people's heads.
                              I spoke of
                              it once to Lord Newhaven, after his speech in the House of Lords. I thought he was
                              more educated
                              and a shade less thoughtless than the idle rich usually are, and that he would see
                              it if it was
                              put plainly before him. But he only said my arguments were incontrovertible, and slipped
                              away.”

                              once if I were you. It will save a lot of trouble, and it will come to just the same
                              in the

                           <p id="d75437e4294">Rachel laughed, but not light-heartedly. Hester had only put into words a latent conviction
                              of
                              her own which troubled her.

                              he lives up to. If that is not high praise I don't know what is. He is good, but somehow
                              his
                              goodness does not offend one. One can condone it. And if you care for such things,
                              he has a
                              thorough-going respect for women, which he carries about with him in a little patent

                              faintly,
                              “that it seems now, looking back, such a dreadful waste.”

                           <p id="d75437e4333">“Only in appearance, not in reality,” said Hester. “It looks like a waste of life,
                              that mowing
                              down of our best years by a relentless passion which itself falls dead on the top
                              of them. But
                              it is not so. Every year I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in
                              the love we
                              have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish prudence which will risk
                              nothing, and
                              which, shirking pain, misses happiness as well. No one ever yet was the poorer in
                              the long run
                              for having once in a lifetime ‘let out all the length of all the reins.’”

                              see I don't take a burning interest in my own character. I don't find my mental standpoint—isn't
                              that what Mrs. Loftus calls it?—very engrossing.”

                              and if I could have driven over him in an omnibus I would have done so with pleasure.

                              erected
                              out of gratitude to him for not marrying you. And now, Rachel, will you forgive me
                              beforehand
                              for what I am going to say?”

                              frightful.
                              You are getting out a dagger, and I shall be its sheath directly.”

                              There is something stubborn and inflexible in you—the seamy side of your courage and
                              steadfastness—which cannot readily enter into the feelings of others or put itself
                              in their
                              place. I think it is want of imagination—I mean the power of seeing things as they
                              are. You are
                              the kind of woman who, if you had married comfortably some one you rather liked, might
                              have
                              become like Sybell Loftus, who never understands any feeling beyond her own microscopic
                              ones,
                              and who measures love by her own small preference for Doll. You would have had no
                              more sympathy
                              than she has. People, like Sybell, believe one can only sympathise with what one has
                              experienced. That is why they are<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="136"> </a></span> always saying ‘as a mother,’
                              or ‘as a wife.’ If that were true the world would have to get on without sympathy,
                              for no two
                              people have the same experience. Only a shallow nature believes that a resemblance
                              in two cups
                              means that they both contain the same wine. Sybell believes it, and you would have
                              been very
                              much the same, not from lack of perception, as in her case, but for want of using
                              your powers of
                              perception. If you had not undergone an agonised awakening all the great realities
                              of life—love,
                              hatred, temptation, enthusiasm—would have remained for you as they have remained for
                              Sybell,
                              merely pretty words to string on light conversation. That is why I can't bear to hear
                              her speak
                              of them because every word she says proves she has not known them. But the sword that
                              pierced
                              your heart forced an entrance for angels, who had been knocking where there was no
                              door—until

                              The question crept in between the friends and moved them apart. Hester's voice altered.

                              he preferred a

                           <p id="d75437e4582">Perhaps one of the reasons why Lady Newhaven and Sybell Loftus did not “get on,” was
                              owing to a
                              certain superficial resemblance between them.

                           <p id="d75437e4586">Both exacted attention, and if they were in the same room together it seldom contained
                              enough
                              attention to supply the needs of both. Both were conscious, like “Celia Chettam,”
                              that since the
                              birth of their first child their opinions respecting literature, politics, and art
                              had acquired
                              additional weight and solidity, and that a wife and mother could pronounce with decision
                              on
                              important subjects where a spinster would do well to hold her peace. Each was fond
                              of saying,
                              “As a married woman I think this or that”; yet each was conscious of dislike and irritation
                              when
                              she heard the other say it. And there is no doubt that Sybell had been too unwell
                              to appear at
                              Lady Newhaven's garden party the previous summer, because Lady Newhaven had the week
                              before
                              advanced her cherished theory of “one life one love,” to the delight of Lord Newhaven,
                              and the
                              natural annoyance of Sybell, whose second husband was at that moment handing tea,
                              and answering,
                              “That depends,” when appealed to.

                              she is older. I don't know why you go to Wilderleigh of all places.”

                              himself, came on purpose to meet her. It is very tiresome of her to behave like that,
                              especially
                              as she did not say she had any engagement. You make a mistake Rachel, in running after

                              about her at all. And I asked her how she judged of people, and she said, ‘By appearances.’
                              Now
                              that was very silly, because as I explained to her, appearances were most deceptive,
                              and I had
                              often thought a person with a cold manner was cold-hearted, and afterwards found I
                              was quite
                              mistaken.”

                           <p id="d75437e4616">Rachel did not answer. She wondered in what the gift consisted, which Lady Newhaven
                              and Sybell
                              both possessed, of bringing all conversation to a standstill.

                           <p id="d75437e4619">“It seems curious,” said Lady Newhaven after a pause, “how the books are mostly written
                              by the
                              people who know least of life. Now the ‘Sonnets from the Portuguese.’ People think
                              so much of
                              them. I was looking at them the other day. Why, they are nothing to what I have felt.
                              I
                              sometimes think if

                              own
                              religious feelings, and described love and love's tragedy as they really are, what<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="143" data-tei-n="142"> </a></span> a sensation it would make. It would take the world by storm.”

                              that Rachel's eyes fell before it. “I am sometimes almost certain that Edward drew
                              the short
                              lighter. Oh! do you think if he did he will really

                           <p id="d75437e4643">“If he drew it he will certainly take the consequences.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e4646">“Will he, do you think? I am almost sure he drew it. He is doing so many little things
                              that look
                              as if he knew he were not going to live. I heard Mr. Carstairs ask him to go to Norway
                              with him
                              next spring, and Edward laughed, and said he never looked more than a few months ahead.”

                              a plea of fatigue. It was a momentary cowardice that tempted her to yield to her fatigue.
                              She
                              felt convinced that she should meet Hugh Scarlett at Wilderleigh. She had no reason
                              for the
                              conviction beyond the very inadequate one that she had met him at Sybell's London
                              house.
                              Nevertheless she felt sure that he would be among the guests, and she longed for a
                              little
                              breathing space after parting with Lady Newhaven before she met him. Presently Sybell
                              flew in
                              and embraced her with effusion.

                              quite right
                              to lie down before dinner, only you aren't lying down. We have had such a conversation
                              downstairs. The others are all out boating with Doll but Mr. Harvey, the great Mr.

                              herself in the glass.

                              to the uttermost; and they had descended the staircase together, and had crossed the

                              the little crowd in the drawing-room. For an instant her face turned from white to
                              grey, and she
                              involuntarily put out her hand as if to ward off something. Then a lovely colour mounted
                              to her
                              cheek; she drew herself up and entered the room, while Hugh, behind her, looked fiercely

                              blind for him.

                           <p id="d75437e4881">Mr. Tristram was one of the many who judge their actions in the light of after circumstances,
                              and
                              who towards middle age discover that the world is a treacherous world. He had not
                              been “in a
                              position to marry” when he had fallen in love with Rachel. But he had been as much
                              in love with
                              her as was consistent with a permanent prudential passion for himself and his future,
                              that
                              future which the true artist must ever preserve untrammelled. “High hopes faint on
                              a warm
                              hearthstone,” &amp;c. He had felt keenly breaking with Rachel. Later on, when a tide of
                              wealth
                              flowed up to the fifth floor of Museum Buildings, he had recognised for the first
                              time that he
                              had made a great mistake in life. To the smart of baffled love had been added acute
                              remorse, not
                              so much for wealth missed as for having inflicted upon himself and upon her a frightful
                              and
                              unnecessary pain. But how could he have foreseen such a thing? How could he tell?
                              he had asked
                              himself in mute stupefaction when the news reached him. What a cheat life was! What
                              a fickle
                              jade was Fortune!

                              bristling at her elbow. “And the little Spanish boy whom you were so kind to, and

                              momentary irritation at finding Mr. Harvey was on Rachel's other side. “I did not

                              conversation with her in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Gresley. Whenever I spoke to

                              Gresley answered, and sometimes Mrs. Gresley also. In fact, Mr. Gresley considered
                              the call as
                              paid to himself. Mrs. Loftus tells me he is much cleverer than his sister, but I did
                              not gain
                              that impression. And after I had given tongue to every platitude I could think of
                              I had to take

                              intellectual subjects. I suppose he was referring to my platitudes. He said living
                              in the
                              country cut him off almost entirely from the society of his mental equals, so much
                              so that at
                              times he had thoughts of moving to London, and making a little centre for intellectual
                              society.
                              According to him the whole neighbourhood was sunk in a state of hopeless apathy, with
                              the
                              exception of Mrs. Loftus. He said she was the only really clever cultivated person
                              in

                              interrogatively, looking at his graceful, animated hostess.

                           <p id="d75437e4952">“No. She asked me rather late in the day. I fancy I was a ‘fill up.’ I accepted in

                              rather a vague one, that I might meet you here.”

                              faster than
                              its wont. She looked straight in front of her, and her absent eyes fell on Mr. Tristram
                              sitting
                              opposite, talking somewhat sulkily to Miss Barker. Rachel looked steadily at him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e4958">Mr. Tristram had been handsome once, and four years had altered him but little in
                              that respect.
                              He had not yet grown stout, but it was evident that Nature had that injury in reserve
                              for him.
                              To grow stout is not necessarily to look common, but if there is an element of inherent
                              commonness<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="152" data-tei-n="151"> </a></span> in man or woman, a very little additional
                              surface will make it manifest, as an enlarged photograph magnifies its own defects.
                              The “little
                              more and how much it is” had come upon the unhappy Tristram, once the slimmest of
                              the slim. Life
                              had evidently not gone too well with him. Self-pity and the harassed look which comes
                              of
                              annoyance with trifles had set their mark upon him. His art had not taken possession
                              of him.
                              “High hopes faint on a warm hearth-stone.” But they sometimes faint also in bachelor
                              lodgings.
                              The whole effect of the man was second rate, mentally, morally, socially. He seemed
                              exactly on a
                              par with the second-rate friends with whom Sybell loved to surround herself. Hugh
                              and Dick were
                              taking their revenge on the rival who blocked their way. Whatever their faults might
                              be, they
                              were gentlemen, and Mr. Tristram was only “a perfect gentleman.” Rachel had not known
                              the
                              difference when she was young. She saw it now.

                              slowly towards her, “that I have your sympathy in the great cause to which I have
                              dedicated
                              myself, the emancipation of woman.”

                           <p id="d75437e4969">Mr. Harvey paid no more attention to her remark than any one with a theory to propound
                              which must
                              be delivered to the world as a whole.

                           <p id="d75437e4973">“I venture to think,” he continued, his heavy, lustreless eyes coming to a standstill
                              upon her,
                              “that though I accept in all reverence the position of woman as the equal of man,
                              as promulgated
                              in ‘The Princess,’ by our lion-hearted Laureate, nevertheless I advance beyond him
                              in that
                              respect. I hold,” in a voice calculated to impress the whole table, “that woman is
                              man's
                              superior, and that she degrades herself when she endeavours to place herself on an

                              unto death upon the bosom of the earth. The great forms of the trees, felt rather
                              than seen,
                              were darkness made visible. Among the night of high elms round Warpington a single
                              yellow light
                              burned in an upper window. It had been burning all night. And now, as the night waned,
                              the
                              little light waned with it. At last, it was suddenly blown out.

                              yet. In the
                              grey sky over the grey land the morning star, alone and splendid, kept watch in the

                              and the morning star in her soul were to her the same. They stooped together, they
                              merged into
                              one great light, heralding a perfect day presently to be.

                              waves of
                              art. And we recognise Him, and would fain go to meet Him. But our companions and our
                              own fears
                              dissuade us. They say it is only a spirit, and that Christ does not walk on water,
                              that the land
                              whither we are rowing is the place He has Himself appointed for us to meet Him. So
                              our little
                              faith keeps us in the boat, or fails us in the waves of that wind-swept sea.

                           <p id="d75437e5052">It seemed to Hester as if once, long ago, shrinking and shivering, she had stood in
                              despair upon
                              the shore of a great sea, and had heard a voice from the other side say, “Come over.”
                              She had
                              stopped her ears, she had tried not to go. She had shrunk back a hundred times from
                              the cold
                              touch of the water that each time she essayed let her trembling foot through it. And
                              now, after
                              an interminable interval, after she had trusted and doubted, had fallen and been sustained,
                              had
                              met the wind and the rain, after she had sunk in despair, and risen again, she knew
                              not how, now
                              at length a great wave—the last—had cast her up half-drowned upon the shore. A miracle
                              had
                              happened. She had reached the other side, and was lying in a great peace after the
                              storm upon
                              the solemn shore under a great white star.

                              he. Across
                              the pause which God has set 'twixt night and day came the first word of the robin.
                              It reached
                              Hester's ear as from another world, a world that had been left behind. The fragmentary

                              floated up to her from an immeasurable distance like scattered bubbles through deep

                              shapes moved athwart the vacancy of the meadows. Voices called through the grey. Close

                              feeble health before the birth of her children, but had she ever pleaded ill-health
                              as an excuse
                              for absenting herself from one of the many services which her husband held to be the
                              mainspring
                              of the religious life?

                              quivering, and withdrawing her hand from her husband's arm. She almost hated the slight
                              graceful
                              figure, which was not of her world, which was, as she thought, coming between her

                              a glade of silver and trembling opal, which surely mortal foot had never trod, seemed
                              infinitely
                              removed from him. Dimly he felt that she was at one with this mysterious morning world,
                              and that
                              he, the owner, was an alien and a trespasser in his own garden.

                           <p id="d75437e5097">But a glimpse of his cucumber frames in the background reassured him. He advanced
                              with a firmer
                              step, as one among allies.

                           <p id="d75437e5104">She was gazing with an absorption that shut out all other sights and sounds at the
                              solitary
                              blossom on the magnolia tree. Yesterday it had been a bud. But to-day the great almond
                              white
                              petals which guarded it, overlapping each other so jealously, had opened wide, and
                              the perfect
                              flower, keeping nothing back, had laid bare all its pure white soul before its God.

                           <p id="d75437e5107">As Mr. Gresley stopped beside her, Hester turned her little pinched ravaged face towards
                              him and
                              smiled. Something of the passionate self-surrender of the flower was reflected in
                              her eyes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5110">“Dear Hester,” he said, seeing only the wan drawn face. “Are you ill?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5113">“Yes. No. I don't think so,” said Hester tremulously, recalled suddenly to herself.
                              She looked
                              hastily about her. The world of dew and silver had deserted her, had broken like an
                              iridescent
                              bubble at a touch. The magnolia withdrew itself. Hester found herself suddenly transplanted
                              into
                              the prose of life, emphasised by a long clerical coat, and a bed of Brussels sprouts.

                           <p id="d75437e5116">“I missed you,” said Mr. Gresley with emphasis.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5120">“Where? When?” Hester's eyes had lost their fixed look, and stared vacantly at him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5123">Mr. Gresley tried to subdue his rising annoyance.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e5134">“Have you not found me, there?” said Hester below her breath, but so low that fortunately
                              her
                              brother did not catch the words, and was spared their profanity.

                           <p id="d75437e5138">“I will appeal to her better feelings,” he said to himself. “They must be there if
                              I can only
                              touch them.”

                              we must be
                              able to reach up to them, or by reason of our low stature we may succeed only in appealing
                              to
                              the lowest in them in spite of our tip-toe good intentions. Is that why such appeals
                              too often
                              meet with bitter sarcasm and indignation?

                              overslept herself after a sleepless night, and had finished dressing but the moment
                              before he
                              found her in the garden. He entreated her to put aside such insincerity as unworthy
                              of her. He
                              reminded her of the long months she had spent at Warpington with its peculiar spiritual
                              opportunities; that he should be to blame if he did not press upon her the first importance
                              of
                              the religious life, the ever-present love of God, and the means of approaching Him
                              through the
                              sacraments. He entreated her to join her prayers with his that she might be saved
                              from the
                              worship of her own talent which had shut out the worship of God, from this dreadful
                              indifference
                              to holy things, and the impatience of all religious teaching which he grieved to see
                              in her.

                              which he knew not how she had emerged, passionately distressed at the opposition he
                              met with as
                              he would have drawn her lovingly towards it.

                              water. She
                              stifled many fierce and cruel impulses to speak as plainly as he did, to tell him
                              that it was<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="159" data-tei-n="158"> </a></span> not religion that was abhorrent to her, but the form in which
                              he presented it to her, and that the sin against the Holy Ghost was disbelief, like
                              his in the
                              religion of others. But when have such words availed anything? When have they been
                              believed?
                              Hester had a sharp tongue, and she was slowly learning to beware of it as her worst
                              enemy. She
                              laid down many weapons before she trusted herself to speak.

                              cold. “I am
                              sorry you regard me as you do. But from your point of view you were right to speak—as—as
                              you
                              have done. I value the affection that prompted it.”

                              meanness of
                              such tactics. “They say she is so clever, and she can't refute a word I say. She appears
                              to
                              yield and then defies me. She always puts me off like that.”

                              she does she
                              loves for ever.” What was that poem he and she had so often read together? Tennyson,
                              wasn't it?
                              about love not altering “when it alteration finds,” but bears it out even to the crack
                              of doom.
                              Fine poet, Tennyson, he knew the human heart. She had certainly adored him four years
                              ago, just
                              in the devoted way in which he needed to be loved. And how he had worshipped her!
                              Of course he
                              had behaved badly. He saw that now. But if he had it was not from want of love. She
                              had been
                              unable to see that at the time. Good women were narrow, and they were hard, and they
                              did not
                              understand men. Those were their faults. Had she learnt better by now? Did she realise
                              that she
                              had far better marry a man who had loved her for herself, and who still loved her,

                              at the
                              gentle familiar face beside him.

                              am glad I arranged to stay on. I will speak to her this afternoon. She has become
                              much softened,

                              time when that beast of an eel got among the roots. I'll ask Withers what he thinks.
                              I wish
                              Gresley would not call the Dissenters blind leaders of the blind. It's such bad form,

                              don't suppose the text meant that to start with, and what's the use of ill-feeling
                              in a parish.
                              And I'll take Scarlett with me. We'll slip off after luncheon, and leave that bounder

                              her little
                              daughter. “Worms! what a splendid comparison. The Churchman the full-grown man after
                              the stature
                              of Christ, and the Dissenter invertebrate (I think dear James means inebriate) like
                              a worm
                              cleaving to the earth. But possibly God in His mercy may let them slip in by a back
                              door to
                              heaven! How like him to say that, so generous, so wide-minded, taking the hopeful
                              view of
                              everything. How noble he looks. These are days in which we should stick to our colours.
                              I wonder
                              how he can think of such beautiful things. For my part I think the duty of the true
                              priest is
                              not to grovel to the crowd and call wrong right and right wrong for the sake of a
                              fleeting
                              popularity. How striking! What a lesson to the Bishop if he were only here. He is
                              so lax about
                              Dissent, as if right and wrong were mere matters of opinion. What a gift he has. I
                              know he will
                              eat nothing for luncheon. If only we were somewhere else where the best joints were
                              a little
                              cheaper, and his talents more appreciated.” And Mrs. Gresley closed her eyes and prayed
                              earnestly, a tear sliding down her cheek on to Mary's floss-silk mane, that she might
                              become
                              less unworthy to be the wife of one so far above her, that the children might all
                              grow up like
                              him, and that she might be given patience to bear with Hester even when she vexed
                              him.

                              when he saw it, and he was aware that Hester possessed it, though his sisters would
                              have laughed
                              at the idea. He had seen many well-bred women on social pinnacles look like that,
                              whose houses
                              were at present barred against him. The Pratt sisters were fixed into their smartness

                              gracefully
                              worn, or lightly laid aside as in Hester's case. He had known Hester slightly in London
                              for
                              several years. He had seen her on terms of intimacy, such as she never showed to his
                              sisters,
                              with inaccessible men and women with whom he had achieved a bare acquaintance, but
                              whom, in
                              spite of many carefully concealed advances, he had found it impossible to know better.
                              Captain
                              Pratt had reached that stage in his profession of raising himself when he had become
                              a social
                              barometer. He was excessively careful whom he knew, what women he danced with, what
                              houses he
                              visited, and any of his acquaintances who cared to ascertain their own social status
                              to a
                              hairsbreadth had only to apply to it the touchstone of Captain Pratt's manner towards

                              which he treated her on his rare visits to the parental Towers; and which his sisters
                              could only
                              construe as a sign that “Algy was gone on Hessie.”

                           <p id="d75437e5298">It was true. If Hester had been Lady Hester, it is possible that the surname of Pratt,
                              if
                              frequently refused by stouter women, might eventually have been offered to her. But
                              Captain
                              Pratt was determined to marry rank, and nothing short of a Lady Something was of any
                              use to him.
                              An Honourable was better than nothing, but it did not count for much with him. It
                              had a way of
                              absenting itself when wanted. No one was announced as an Honourable. It did<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="165" data-tei-n="164"> </a></span> not even appear on cards. It might be overlooked. Rank, to be of any
                              practical value, must be apparent, obvious. Lady Georgiana Pratt, Lady Evelina Pratt!
                              Any name
                              would do with that prefix. His eye travelled as far as Sybell and stopped again. She
                              was “the
                              right sort” herself, and she dressed in the right way. Why could not Ada and Selina
                              imitate her?
                              But he had never forgiven her the fact that he had met “a crew of cads” at her house,
                              whom he
                              had been obliged to cut afterwards in the Row. No, Sybell would not have done for
                              him. She
                              surrounded herself with vulgar people.

                              shop girls, and his eye was moved on by the rigid police of etiquette which ruled
                              his every
                              movement. It paused momentarily on Rachel. He knew about her, as did every bachelor
                              in London. A
                              colossal heiress. She was neither plain nor handsome. She had a good figure, but not
                              good enough
                              to counterbalance her nondescript face. She had not the air of distinction which he
                              was so quick
                              to detect and appraise. She was a social nonentity. He did not care to look at her
                              a second
                              time. “I would not marry her with twice her fortune,” he said to himself.

                              his father had broken earlier in the day. Regie often brought back to her what his

                              the sincerity of the religion of others, because it is not in the same narrow form

                              it is the good in your hearers which opposes you, the love of God in them which is

                              place on his chancel wall where the tablet to his memory would be put up. When he

                              the churchyard, his mother leaning on his arm, his step regulated by her feeble one,

                              the vacant space by his father's grave already filled by the mound of raw earth which
                              would
                              shortly cover him. His heart had ached for his mother, for the gentle feeble-minded
                              sister who
                              had transferred the interest in life, which keeps body and soul together, from her
                              colourless
                              existence to that of her brother. Hughie was the romance of her grey life: what Hughie
                              said,
                              what Hughie thought, Hughie's wife—oh, jealous thought only to be met by prayer! But
                              later on,
                              joy of joys—Hughie's children! He realised it, now and then, vaguely, momentarily,
                              but never as
                              fully as last Sunday. He shrank from the remembrance, and his mind wandered anew in
                              the
                              labyrinth of broken twisted thought, from which he could find no way out.

                              There was no help for him. There was no way out. He was in a trap. He must die, and

                              he said to himself, nervous and self-confident by turns, resting his head rather gracefully
                              on
                              his hand. His knowledge of womankind supported him like a life-belt, but it has been

                              life-belts occasionally support their wearers upside down. Theories have been known
                              to exhibit
                              the same spiteful tendency towards those who place their trust in them.

                              steadily
                              at the Welsh hills. “She would not have come out if I had asked her, but she will
                              certainly come
                              as I did not. I will give her half an hour.”

                              heard her step on the gravel. His respect for her fell somewhat at this alacrity.

                              that the
                              artistic life made great demands, that the true artist must live entirely for his

                              hearthstones. Mr. Tristram demolished these objections as ruthlessly as ducks peck

                              Well, he would leave her to the life she had chosen. It only remained for him to thank

                              his illusions as he did when he had them on. He had read somewhere a little poem about

                              Woman's No,” which at the last moment meant “Yes.” And then there was another which
                              chronicled
                              how after several stanzas of upbraiding “we rushed into each other's arms.” Both recurred
                              to him
                              now. He had often thought how true they were.

                              defiance, for he was just the kind of man, and they both knew it.

                              beetle's wing. Each little twig and twiglet was made manifest, raw gold against the

                              that lurked beneath the heavy boughs.

                              observe her. He looked critically at her, first with one round eye, and then, turning
                              his sleek
                              head, with the other, and decided that she was harmless.

                           <p id="d75437e5584">Presently a robin dropped down close to her, flashing up his grey underwing as he

                              sadness into your heart. If you are joyful shut your ears against him, for you may
                              keep peace
                              but never joy while he is singing. He knows all about it, “love's labour lost,” the
                              grey face of
                              young Love dead, the hard-wrought grave in the live rock where he is buried. And he
                              tells of it
                              again, and again and again, as if Love's sharp sword had indeed reddened his little
                              breast,
                              until the heart aches to hear him. But he tells also that consolation is folded not
                              in
                              forgetfulness, but in remembrance. That is why he sings in the silence of the autumn
                              dawn,
                              before memory closes her eyes, and again near sunset, when memory wakes.

                              She found at last that forgetfulness came not of prayer and fasting: that it was not
                              in her to

                              “had nothing left to give.”

                              life. She saw that it was false, that she had been frightened where no fear was, that

                              to be true.
                              At last there was dead silence. No echo of a footfall. Quite gone. He had departed
                              not only out
                              of her presence but out of her life.

                           <p id="d75437e5608">She breathed again. A tremor like that which shakes the first green leaf against the
                              March sky
                              stole across her crushed heart, empty at last, empty at last. She raised her hand
                              timidly in the
                              sunshine. She was free. She looked round dazzled, bewildered. The little world of
                              sunshine and
                              the turquoises of sky strewn among the golden network of the trees smiled at her,
                              as one who
                              brings good tidings.

                              suddenly upon her like a lost friend from over seas. Scales seemed to fall from her
                              eyes. The
                              light was too much for her. She had forgotten how beautiful the world was. Everything
                              was
                              possible.

                              not reached her, bowed as she thought beneath God's hand. And the sure return of the

                              to regard Sunday as a day of rest.

                              Hugh
                              regarded it without excitement. Both agreed that it was coming on nicely. Hugh thought
                              he ought
                              to do a little planting at his own place. Doll said you could not do everything at
                              once. A large
                              new farm was the next object of interest. “Uncle George rebuilt Greenfields from the
                              ground,”
                              remarked Doll, as they crossed the high road and took to the harvesting fields where
                              “the ricks
                              stood grey to the sun.”

                           <p id="d75437e5652">Hugh nodded. Doll thought he was a very decent chap, though rather low spirited. Hugh
                              thought
                              that if Mr. George Loftus had been alive he might have consulted him. In an amicable

                              broken occasionally by whistling for Crack, who hurried blear-eyed and asthmatic out
                              of rabbit
                              holes, the pair reached Beaumere; and, after following the path through<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="178" data-tei-n="177"> </a></span> the wood, came suddenly upon the little lake locked in the heart of
                              the steeply climbing forest.

                           <p id="d75437e5657">Doll stood still and pointed with his stick for fear Hugh might overlook it. “I come
                              here every

                           <p id="d75437e5660">A sense of unreality and foreboding seized on Hugh, as the still face of the water
                              looked up at
                              him. Where had he seen it before, this sea of glass reflecting the yellow woods that
                              stooped to
                              its very edge? What had it to do with him?

                           <p id="d75437e5663">“I've been here before,” he said, involuntarily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5666">“I daresay,” said Doll. “Newhaven marches with me here. The boundary is by that clump
                              of silver
                              birch. The Drone comes in there, but you can't see it. The Newhavens are friends of
                              yours,
                              aren't they?”

                           <p id="d75437e5670">“Acquaintances,” said Hugh absently, looking hard at the water. He had never been
                              here before.
                              Memory groped blindly for a lost link, as one who momentarily recognises a face in
                              a crowd, and
                              tries to put a name to it and fails. As the face disappears, so the sudden impression
                              passed
                              from Hugh's mind.

                           <p id="d75437e5676">“I used to see a good deal of them at one time,” said Hugh, “but they seem to have
                              forgotten me
                              of late.”

                           <p id="d75437e5679">“Oh! that's her,” said Doll. “She is always oft and on with people. Takes a fancy
                              one day and a
                              dislike the next. But he's not like that. You always know where to find him. Solid
                              man,
                              Newhaven. He doesn't say much, but what he says he sticks to.”

                           <p id="d75437e5682">“He gives one that impression,” said Hugh.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5685">“I rather think he is there now,” said Doll, pointing to the further shore. “I see
                              a figure
                              moving, and two little specks. I should not wonder if it were him and the boys. They
                              often come
                              here on Sunday afternoons.”

                           <p id="d75437e5689">“You have long sight,” said Hugh. He had met Lord Newhaven several times since the
                              drawing of
                              lots, and they<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="178"> </a></span> had always greeted each other with cold
                              civility. But Hugh avoided him when he could without drawing attention to the fact
                              that he did
                              so.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5694">“Are you going over to his side?” he asked.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5697">“Rather not,” said Doll. “I have never set a single trimmer or fired a shot beyond
                              that clump of
                              birch, or Uncle George before me.”

                           <p id="d75437e5700">The two men picked their way down the hillside among the tall thin tree trunks. There
                              was no one
                              except the dogs at the keeper's cottage in a clearing half-way down. Doll took the
                              key of the
                              boathouse from a little hole under the eaves.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5703">“I think Withers must be out,” he remarked at last, after knocking and calling at
                              the locked door
                              and peering through the closed window. Hugh had been of that opinion for some time.
                              “Gone out
                              with his wife, I expect. Never mind, we can do without him.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5706">They went slipping over the dry beech-mast to the boathouse. Doll unlocked the door
                              and climbed
                              into one of the boats, Hugh and Crack followed. They got a perch rod off a long shelf,
                              and half
                              a dozen trimmers. Then they pulled out a little way and stopped near an archipelago
                              of
                              water-lily leaves.

                           <p id="d75437e5710">Doll got out the perch rod and float and made a cast.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5713">“It's not fishing,” he said apologetically, half to his guest and half to his Maker.
                              “But we are
                              bound to get some baits.”

                           <p id="d75437e5716">Hugh nodded and gazed down at the thin forest below. He could see the perch moving
                              in little
                              companies in the still water beyond the water trees. Presently a perch, a very small
                              one, out
                              alone for the first time, came up, all stiff head and shoulders and wagging tail,
                              to the
                              carelessly covered hook.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5719">“Don't, don't, you young idiot,” said Hugh below his breath. But the perch knew that
                              the time had
                              come when a perch must judge for himself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5722">The float curtsied and went under, and in another second the little independent was
                              in the
                              boat.

                           <p id="d75437e5728">“There are other fools in the world besides me, it seems,” said Hugh to himself.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5731">“He'll do, but I wish he was a dace,” said Doll, slipping the victim into a tin with
                              holes in the
                              top. “Half a dozen will be enough.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5734">They got half a dozen, baited and set the trimmers white side up, and were turning
                              to row back,
                              when Doll's eye became suddenly fixed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5737">“By Jove, there's something at it,” he said, pointing to a trimmer at some distance.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5740">Both men looked intently at it. Crack felt that something was happening, and left
                              off smelling
                              the empty fish-can.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5743">The trimmer began to nod, to tilt, and then turned suddenly upside down, and remained
                              motionless.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5747">“He's running the line off it,” said Doll.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5750">As he spoke the trimmer gave one jerk and went under. Then it reappeared, awkwardly
                              bustling out
                              into the open.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5753">“Oh! hang it all, it's Sunday,” said Doll with a groan. “We can't be catching pike
                              on a Sunday.”
                              And he caught up the oars and rowed swiftly towards the trimmer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5756">As soon as they were within a boat's length it disappeared again, came up again, and
                              went pecking
                              along the top of the water. Doll pursued warily and got hold of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5759">“Gently now,” he said, as he shipped the oars. “He'll go under the boat and break
                              us if we don't
                              look out. I'll play him, and you shove the net under him. Damn!—God forgive me!—We
                              have come out
                              without a landing-net. Good Lord, Scarlett, you can't gaff him with a champagne-opener.
                              There,
                              you pull him in, and I'll grab him somehow. I've done it before. Crack, lie down,
                              you infernal
                              fool. Scarlett, if you pull him like that you'll lose him to a certainty. By George,
                              he's a big
                              one.” Doll tore off his coat and pulled up his shirtsleeves. “He's going under the
                              boat. If you
                              let him go under the boat, I tell you he'll break us. I'm quite ready.” Doll was rubbing
                              his
                              waistcoat-buttons against the gunwale. “Bring him in gradually. For goodness' sake,
                              keep your
                              feet<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="181" data-tei-n="180"> </a></span> off the line, or, if he makes a dash, he'll break
                              you. Give him line. Keep your elbows out. Keep your hands free. Don't let him jerk
                              you. If you
                              don't give him more line when he runs, you'll lose him. He's not half done yet. Confound
                              you,
                              Scarlett, hold on for all you're worth. All right, old chap, all right. Don't mind
                              me. You're
                              doing it first-class. Right as rain. Now, now. By George, did you see him that time?
                              He's a
                              nailer. Steady on him. Bring him in gently. Keep an even pull on him. Keep steady.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5764">Doll craned over the gunwale, his arms in the water. There was a swirl, a momentary
                              glimpse of a
                              stolid fish face, and heavy shoulders, and the boat righted itself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5768">“Missed him as I live!” gasped Doll. “Bring him in again.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5771">Hugh let out the slippery line and drew it in again slowly, hand over hand. Doll's
                              round head was
                              over the side, his long legs spread adhesively in the bottom of the boat. Crack, beyond
                              himself
                              with excitement, got on the seat and barked without ceasing.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5774">“He's coming up again,” said Doll gutturally, sliding forward his left hand. “I must
                              get him by
                              the eyes, and then I doubt if I can lift him. He's a big brute. He's dragging the
                              whole boat and
                              everything. He's about done now. Steady! Now!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5777">The great side of the pike lay heaving on the surface for a second, and Doll's left
                              forefinger
                              and thumb were groping for its eyes. But the agonised pike made a last effort. Doll
                              had him with
                              his left hand, but could not raise him. “Pull him in now for all you're worth,” he
                              roared to
                              Hugh, as he made a grab with his right hand. His legs began to lose their grip under
                              the violent
                              contortions of the pike. The boat tilted madly. Hugh reached forward to help him.
                              There was a
                              frantic effort, and it capsized.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5780">“Bad luck,” said Doll, coming up sputtering, shaking his head like a spaniel. “But
                              we shall get
                              him yet. He's bleeding like a pig. He'll come up directly. Good Lord, the water's<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="182" data-tei-n="181"> </a></span> like ice. We must be over one of the springs. I suppose you are all
                              right, Scarlett.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5785">Hugh had come up, but in very different fashion.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5789">“Yes,” he said faintly, clutching the upturned boat.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5792">“I'm not sure,” said Doll, keeping going with one hand, “that we had not better get
                              ashore, and
                              fetch the other boat. The water's enough to freeze one.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5795">“I can't swim,” said Hugh, his teeth chattering.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5798">He was a delicate man at the best of times, and the cold was laying hold of him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5801">Doll looked at his blue lips and shaking hands, and his face became grave. He measured
                              the
                              distance to the shore with his eye. It had receded in a treacherous manner.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5804">“I'm not much of a performer myself,” he said, “since I broke my arm last winter,
                              but I can get
                              to the shore. The question is, can you hold on while I go back and bring the other
                              boat, or
                              shall we have a try at getting back together?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5808">“I can hold on all right,” said Hugh, instantly aware that Doll did not think he could
                              tow him to
                              land, but was politely ready to risk his existence in the attempt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5811">“Back directly,” said Doll, and without a second's delay he was gone. Hugh put out
                              his whole
                              strength in the endeavour to raise himself somewhat out of the ice-cold water. But
                              the upturned
                              boat sidled away from him like a skittish horse, and after grappling with it he only
                              slipped
                              back again exhausted, and had to clutch it as best he could.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5814">As he clung to the gunwale he heard a faint coughing and gasping close to his ear.
                              Some one was
                              drowning. Hugh realised that it must be Crack, under the boat. He called to him, he
                              chirruped as
                              if all were well. He stretched one hand as far as he could under the boat feeling
                              for him. But
                              he could not reach him. Presently the faint difficult sound ceased, began again, stopped,
                              and
                              was heard no more.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5817">A great silence seemed to rush in on the extinction of that small sound. It stooped
                              down and
                              enveloped Hugh in it. Everything was very calm, very still. The boat kept turning<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="183" data-tei-n="182"> </a></span> slowly round and round, the only thing that moved. The sunlight
                              quivered on the wet upturned keel. Already it was drying in patches. Hugh watched
                              it. The cold
                              was sapping his powers as if he were bleeding.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5822">“I could have built a boat in the time Loftus takes to fetch one,” he said to himself,
                              and he
                              looked round him. No sign of Doll. He was alone in the world. The cold was gaining
                              on him
                              slowly, surely. Why had he on such heavy gloves which made him fumble so clumsily.
                              He looked at
                              his bare cut hands, and realised that their grip was leaving them. He felt that he
                              was in
                              measurable distance of losing his hold.

                           <p id="d75437e5825">Suddenly a remembrance flashed across him of the sinister face of the water as it
                              had first
                              looked up at him through the trees. Now he understood. This was the appointed place
                              for him to
                              die. Hugh tightened his hold with his right hand, for his left was paralysed.

                           <p id="d75437e5829">“I will not,” he said. “Nothing shall induce me. I will live and marry Rachel.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5832">The cold advanced suddenly on him as at the point of the bayonet.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5835">“Why not die?” said another voice. “Will it be easier in three months' time than it
                              is now? Will
                              it ever be so easy again? See how near death is to life, a wheel within a wheel, two
                              rings
                              linked together. A touch, and you pass from one to the other.”

                           <p id="d75437e5838">Hugh looked wildly round him. The sun lay warm upon the tree tops. It could not be
                              that he was
                              going to die 
                              <emph id="d75437e5840">here</emph> and

                              friendly faces of the hills all round him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e5847">He strengthened his numb hold fiercely, all but lost it, regained it. Cramp long held
                              at bay
                              overcame him.

                           <p id="d75437e5850">And the boat kept turning in the twilight. He reached the end of his strength and
                              held on beyond
                              it. He heard some one near at hand suffocating in long-drawn gasps. Not Crack this
                              time, but
                              himself.

                           <p id="d75437e5859">The struggle was over. “It is better so,” said the other voice, through the roaring
                              of a cataract
                              near at hand. “Your mother will bear it better so. And all the long difficulties are
                              over, and
                              pain is past, and life is past, and sleep is best.”

                           <p id="d75437e5865">She was here in the warm swaying darkness. She was with him. She was Death. Death
                              was only her
                              arms round him in a great peace. Death was better than life. He let go the silly boat
                              that kept
                              him from her, and turned wholly to her, his closed eyes against her breast.

                              entreaties, proceeded to put on its socks and boots.

                              sail his boat upside down.

                              fell anxiously on the children.

                           <p id="d75437e5994">Doll was almost speechless. His breath came in long gasps. The sweat hung on his forehead.
                              He
                              pointed to the black upturned boat.

                           <p id="d75437e6003">“It's got to go all the same, and sharp,” said Doll, hoarsely.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6006">Lord Newhaven seized up a fishing-tin, and thrust it into Doll's hands.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6009">“You bale while I row,” he said, and he rowed as he had never rowed before.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6012">“Who is it?” he said, as the boat shot out into the open.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6016">Doll was baleing like a madman.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6019">“Scarlett,” he said. “And he's over one of the springs. He'll get cramp.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6022">Lord Newhaven strained at his oars.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6025">Consciousness was coming back, was slowly climbing upwards, upwards through immense
                              intervals of
                              time and space, to where at last with a wrench pain met it half-way. Hugh stirred
                              feebly in the
                              dark of a great forlornness and loneliness.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6028">“Rachel,” he said, “Rachel.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6031">His head was gently raised, and a cup pressed to his lips. He swallowed something.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6035">He groped in the darkness for a window, and then opened his eyes. Lord Newhaven withdrew
                              a pace
                              or two, and stood looking at him.

                           <p id="d75437e6038">Their eyes met.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6041">Neither spoke, but Hugh's eyes, dark with the shadow of death, said plainly, “Hast
                              thou found me,
                              oh mine enemy?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6044">Then he turned them slowly, as an infant turns them, to the sky, the climbing woods,
                              leaning over
                              each other's shoulders to look at him, to the warm earth on which he lay. At a little
                              distance
                              was stretched a small rough-haired form. Hugh's eyes fixed on it. It lay very still.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6047">“Crack,” he said suddenly, raising himself on his elbow.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6050">There was neither speech nor language. Crack's tail, that courteous member, made no
                              sign.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6054">“He was under the boat,” said Lord Newhaven, looking narrowly at the exhausted face
                              of the man he
                              had saved, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="188" data-tei-n="187"> </a></span> unable for the life of him to help a momentary
                              fellow-feeling about the little dog.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6059">Hugh remembered. It all came back, the boat, Crack's dying gasps, the agonised struggle,
                              the
                              strait gate of death, the difficult passage through it, the calm beyond. He had almost
                              got
                              through, and had been dragged back.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6062">“Why did you interfere?” he said, in sudden passion, his eyes flaming in his white
                              face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6065">A dull colour rose to Lord Newhaven's cheek.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6068">“I thought it was an accident,” he said. “If it was not I beg your pardon.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6071">There was a moment's silence.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6075">“It 
                              <emph id="d75437e6077">was</emph> an accident,” said Hugh hoarsely, and he turned on his elbow and looked
                              fixedly at the water, so that his companion might not see the working of his face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6081">Lord Newhaven walked slowly away in the direction of Doll, whose distant figure followed
                              by
                              another was hurrying towards them.

                           <p id="d75437e6084">“And so there is a Rachel as well, is there?” he said to himself, vainly trying to
                              steel himself
                              against his adversary.

                           <p id="d75437e6087">“How is he now?” said Doll, coming within earshot.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6090">“He's all right, but you'd better get him into dry clothes and yourself too.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6093">“Change on the bank,” said Doll, seizing a bundle from the keeper. “It's as hot as
                              an oven in the
                              sun. Why Scarlett's sitting up! I thought when we laid into him on the bank that he
                              was too far
                              gone, didn't you? I suppose”—hesitating—

                           <p id="d75437e6111">Doll nodded. He and Lord Newhaven had had a hard fight to get the leaking boat to
                              land with Hugh
                              at the bottom of it. It had filled ominously when Doll ceased baleing to help to drag
                              in the
                              heavy unconscious body.

                              remembered with a qualm that Lord Newhaven could not swim.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6119">“Every fellow ought to swim,” was the moral he drew from the incident and repeated

                              who, struck by the soundness of the remark, repeated it to the Gresleys.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6122">Lord Newhaven retraced his steps slowly along the bank in his water-logged boots.
                              He was tired
                              and he did not hurry, for he could see in the distance two small figures sitting faithfully
                              on a
                              log where he had left them.

                           <p id="d75437e6126">“Good little chaps,” he said half aloud.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6129">In spite of himself his thoughts went back to Hugh. His feelings towards him had not
                              changed, but
                              they had been forced during the last half-hour out of their original intrenchments
                              into the
                              open, and were liable to attack from new directions.

                           <p id="d75437e6132">It was not that he had virtually saved Hugh's life, for Doll would never have got
                              him into the
                              leaking boat and kept it afloat single-handed. That first moment of enthusiasm when
                              he had
                              rubbed the senseless limbs and breathed into the cold lips, and had felt his heart
                              leap when the
                              life came halting back into them, that moment had passed and left him cold.

                           <p id="d75437e6135">But Hugh's melancholy eyes, as they opened once more on this world and met his unflinching,
                              haunted him, and the sudden anger at his interference. It was the intrenchment of
                              his contempt
                              that Lord Newhaven missed.

                              that, but I should have been on a gridiron if he had not. In different circumstances
                              that man
                              and I might have been friends. And if he had got into a scrape of this kind a little
                              further
                              afield I might have helped to get him out of it. He feels it. He has aged during the

                              months. But as it is— Upon my word, if he were a boy I should have had to let him
                              off. It would
                              have been too bloodthirsty. But he is seven and twenty. He is<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="190" data-tei-n="189"> </a></span>

                              to church. On this particular Sunday afternoon Hester and the children were waiting
                              in the
                              little hall till the bell stopped, before which moment they were forbidden to leave
                              the house.
                              Mr. and Mrs. Gresley had just started for the church, Mr. Gresley looking worn and
                              harassed, for
                              since luncheon he had received what he called “a perfectly unaccountable letter” from
                              one of his
                              principal parishioners, a Dissenter, who had been present at the morning service,
                              and who Mr.
                              Gresley had confidently hoped might have been struck by the sermon. This hope had
                              been
                              justified, but not in the manner Mr. Gresley had expected. Mr. Walsh opined in a large
                              round
                              hand that as worms (twice underdashed) did not usually pay voluntary church and school
                              rates he
                              no longer felt himself under an obligation to do so, &amp;c. &amp;c. The letter was a great,
                              an
                              unexpected blow. Who could have foreseen such a result of the morning's eloquence.

                           <p id="d75437e6195">“The truth is,” said Mr. Gresley tremulously, “that they can't and won't hear reason.
                              They can't
                              controvert what I say, so they take refuge in petty spite like this. I must own I
                              am
                              disappointed in Walsh. He is a man of some education, and liberal as regards money.
                              I had
                              thought he was better than most of them, and now he turns on me like this.”

                              listened to
                              what I tried to say this morning, you would have seen I only used the word

                              figuratively. I never meant it literally, as any one could see who was not determined
                              to
                              misunderstand me. Worms pay school rates! Such folly is positively sickening if it
                              were not
                              malicious.”

                              personage,
                              conscious that others have waited, and bearing with him an aroma of Irish stew and
                              onions, which
                              showed that he had been exchanging affabilities with the cook. For the truth must
                              be owned. No
                              spinster over forty could look unmoved on Boulou. Alas! for the Vicarage cook, who
                              “had kept
                              herself 
                              <emph id="d75437e6215">to</emph> herself” for nearly fifty years, only to fall the victim of a “grande
                              passion” for Boulou.

                           <p id="d75437e6219">The little Lovelace bounded in, and the expedition started. It was Regie's turn to
                              choose where
                              they should go, and he decided on the “shrubbery,” a little wood through which ran
                              the private
                              path to Wilderleigh. Doll Loftus had given the Gresleys leave to take the children
                              there.

                           <p id="d75437e6223">“Oh, Regie, we always go there,” said Mary plaintively, who invariably chose the Pratts'
                              park,
                              with its rustic bridges and

                              gracious moment had “thrown open” to, the Gresleys on Sundays, because, as he expressed
                              it,
                              “they must feel so cramped in their little garden.”

                           <p id="d75437e6229">But Regie adhered to his determination, and to the “shrubberies” they went. Hester
                              was too tired
                              to play with them, too tired even to tell them a story; so she sat under a tree while
                              they
                              circled in the coppice near at hand.

                              the shrubs
                              and trees by heart as we did as children in our old garden of Eden, round the little<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="193" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span> gabled house where we were born. We were so thorough as children. We
                              knew the underneath of every laurel bush, the shape of its bunches of darkling branches,
                              the
                              green dust that our small restless bodies rubbed off from its under twigs. We see
                              now as
                              strangers those little hanging horsetails of pink which sad-faced elders call 
                              <hi id="d75437e6236">ribes</hi>,
                              but once long ago when the world was young we knew them eye to eye, and the compact
                              little black
                              insects on them, and the quaint taste of them, and the clean clean smell of them.
                              Everything had
                              a taste in those days and was submitted to that test, just as until it had been licked
                              the real
                              colour of any object of interest was not ascertained. There was a certain scarlet
                              berry, very
                              red without and very white within, which we were warned was deadly poison. How well,
                              after a
                              quarter of a century, we remember the bitter taste of it, how much better than many
                              other
                              forbidden fruits duly essayed in later years. We ate those scarlet berries and lived
                              though
                              warned to the contrary.

                              could have
                              found it, in the middle of the path, and made it an occasion for a theatrical display
                              of
                              growlings and shakings. The children decided to bury it, and after a becoming silence
                              their
                              voices could be heard singing “Home, Sweet Home” as the body was being lowered into

                              previously dug by Boulou, who had to be forcibly restrained from going on digging

                              because I was
                              one little half-hour late. And of course the pretext of urgent business is too transparent,
                              because there is no Sunday post, and the telegraph boy had not been up. I asked that.
                              And he was
                              so anxious to finish the sketch. He almost asked to stay over Sunday on purpose.”

                              can I? Can he have any sense of honour to have acted like that? Is he even really

                              very charming, very refined, and he loves me. He looks good, but what do I know of

                              prostration, and Doll rode into Southminster and returned laden with comic papers.
                              Who shall say
                              whether the cause was physical or mental. Hugh had seen death very near for the first
                              time, and
                              the thought of death haunted him. He had not realised when he drew lots that he was
                              risking the
                              possibility of anything like

                              <emph id="d75437e6355">that</emph>. And he had got to do it again. There was the crux. He had got
                              to do it again.

                              them.

                              know better than to care for London society. Hester does, I know, but then Hester

                              like to hear it. You have had such a dull day with Doll away at his County Council.”

                              the earnest one will undoubtedly remember that in an earlier chapter a sale of work
                              was
                              mentioned which was to take place in the Wilderleigh gardens at the end of August.

                           <p id="d75437e6465">The end of August had now arrived, and with it two white tents, which sprang up suddenly
                              one
                              morning like giant mushrooms on one of Doll's smooth-shaven lawns. He groaned in spirit
                              as he
                              watched their erection. They would ruin the turf.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6469">“Might as well iron it with a hot iron,” he said disconsolately to Hugh. “But, of
                              course, this
                              sort of thing—Diocesan Fund, eh? In these days we must stand by our colours.” He repeated
                              Mr.
                              Gresley's phrase. Doll seldom ventured on an opinion not sanctioned by the ages, or
                              that he had
                              not heard repeated till its novelty had been comfortably rubbed off by his wife or
                              the
                              Gresleys.

                           <p id="d75437e6472">The two men watched the proceedings mournfully. They could not help, at least they
                              were told they
                              could not help the women busily engaged in draping and arranging the stalls. They
                              were still at
                              large, but Doll knew as well as a dog who is going to be washed, what was in store
                              for him in
                              the afternoon, and he was depressed beforehand.

                              It takes a
                              strong man to grapple with this sort of thing. Kills off the weakly ones like flies.
                              You lie low
                              in the smoking-room till it's all over.”

                              and cart up
                              the drive, heavily laden with the work of many months, “that the Pratts have behaved
                              exceedingly
                              badly. Here they are,the richest people by far in the parish, and they would not even
                              take a
                              stall, they would not even furnish half of one, and they said they would be away,
                              and they are
                              at the Towers after all. No one likes the Pratts more than I do, or sees their good
                              points as I
                              do, but I can't shut my eyes to the fact that they are the meanest of the mean.”

                           <p id="d75437e6483">The Pratts had only contributed two “bed-spreads,” and a “sheet-sham,” and a set of
                              antimacassars. If the reader wishes to know what “bed-spreads” and “sheet-shams” are,
                              let him
                              ask his intended, and let him see to it that he marries a woman who cannot tell him.

                           <p id="d75437e6487">Mrs. Pratt had bought the antimacassars for the Towers, and secretly adored them until
                              Ada
                              pronounced them to be vulgar. The number of things which Ada discovered to be vulgar
                              increased
                              every day, and included the greater part of her mother's wardrobe, much to the distress
                              of that
                              poor lady. Mrs. Pratt had reached the size when it is prudent to concentrate a love
                              of bright
                              colours in one's parasol. On this particular afternoon she shed tears over the fact
                              that Ada
                              refused to accompany her if her mother wore a unique garment of orange satin covered
                              with what
                              appeared to be a plague of black worms.

                              carriage after carriage began to arrive, and Sybell, with a mournful, handsome, irreproachably
                              dressed husband, took up her position on the south front to receive her guests.

                              them to
                              appear.

                              Newhaven,
                              and—astonishing vision—Lord Newhaven beside her.

                           <p id="d75437e6509">“Wonders will never cease,” said Doll, shaken for a moment out of the apathy of endurance.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6512">Sybell raised her eyebrows, and advanced with the prettiest air of 
                              <foreign id="d75437e6514" xml:lang="fre">empressement</foreign> to meet her unexpected guests. No, clearly it was impossible that
                              the two women should like each other. They were the same age, about the same height
                              and
                              colouring, their social position was too similar, their historic houses too near each
                              other.
                              Lady Newhaven was by far the best looking, but that was not a difference which attracted
                              Sybell
                              towards her. On this occasion Sybell's face assumed its most squirrel-like expression,
                              for as
                              ill-luck would have it they were dressed alike.

                           <p id="d75437e6519">Lady Newhaven looked very ethereal as she came slowly across the grass in her diaphanous
                              gown of
                              rich white, covered with a flowing veil of thinnest transparent black. Her blue eyes
                              looked
                              restlessly bright, her lips wore a mechanical smile. Rachel watching her, experienced
                              a sudden
                              pang at her undeniable loveliness. It wounded her suddenly as it never had done before.
                              “I am a
                              common-looking square-built woman compared to her,” she said to herself. “No wonder

                           <p id="d75437e6522">She instinctively drew back as Lady Newhaven turned quickly towards her.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6525">“You dear person,” said Lady Newhaven, her eyes moving restlessly over the crowd,
                              “are you still
                              here? Let us go and buy something together. How nice you look,” without looking at
                              her. She drew
                              Rachel apart in the direction of the tents.

                           <p id="d75437e6528">“Where is he?” she said sharply. “I know he is here. I heard all about the accident,
                              though
                              Edward never told me. I don't see him.”

                              And do you see she has got two diamond butterflies on, the little one at her throat
                              and the big

                              put on a single thing. There now, Algy has joined her,” continued Mrs. Pratt, her
                              attention
                              quickly diverted from her own wrongs. “Now they are walking on together. How nice

                              those beautiful clothes. Algy and Lord Newhaven and Mr. Loftus all have the same look,

                              they? All friends together, as I often say, such a mercy among county people. You
                              might walk a
                              little with Lord Newhaven, Ada. It's unaccountable how seldom we see him, but always
                              so pleasant
                              when we do. Ah! he's speaking to Rachel West. They are going to the tents, after all.
                              Well,
                              whatever you may say, I do think we ought to go and buy something, too. Papa says
                              he won't put
                              his hand in his pocket if the Loftuses are to get all the credit, and we ought to
                              have had the
                              choice of having the sale at the Towers, so he shan't do anything; but I think it
                              would be nice
                              if we went and bought a little something. Just a five-pound note. You shall spend
                              it, my dear,
                              if you like.”

                           <p id="d75437e6661">“Oh! I am all right,” said Doll, who by this time hated the subject. “It was Scarlett
                              who was
                              nearly frozen like New Zealand lamb.”

                              to much. Weak
                              chap at the best of times I should think. He's lying low in the smoking-room till
                              the people are

                              water, and
                              spilling a little, “but I can't quite forgive him, no, I really can't, for the danger
                              he caused
                              to Edward. You know, or perhaps you don't know, that Edward can't swim, either. Even
                              now I can't
                              bear to think what might have happened.”

                              you are wanted outside, and I should blame myself if you wasted another minute on
                              me. It was
                              only the sun which affected me. Don't mention it to Edward. He is always so fussy
                              about me. I
                              will rest quietly here for a quarter of an hour, and then rejoin you all again in

                              fancy. I have come to smoke a cigarette in peace,” he added aloud, “if you don't object.”

                           <p id="d75437e6714">Hugh nodded. He wondered how soon he could make a pretext for getting up and leaving

                              in and closed
                              the door. The instant afterwards she saw her husband and shrank back with a little
                              cry. Lord
                              Newhaven did not look at her. His eyes were fixed on Hugh.

                              forward.

                              We will go at once.” He threw away his cigarette. “Well, good-bye, Scarlett, in case
                              we don't
                              meet again. I daresay you will pay Westhope a visit later on. Ah, Captain Pratt! so
                              you have
                              fled, like us, from the madding crowd. I can recommend Loftus's cigarettes. I have
                              just had one
                              myself. Good-bye. Did you leave your purchases in the hall, Violet? Yes? Then we will
                              collect
                              them on our way.”

                           <p id="d75437e6732">The husband and wife were half-way down the grand staircase before Lord Newhaven said
                              in his

                              Did not you see that that white mongrel Pratt was on your track? If I had not been
                              there when he
                              came in he would have drawn his own vile conclusions, and for once they would have
                              been
                              correct.”

                              obtain a hold over you. He is a dangerous man. Don't put yourself in his power.”

                           <p id="d75437e6751">Captain Pratt did not remain long in the smoking-room. He had only a slight acquaintance
                              with
                              Hugh, which did not appear capable of expansion. Captain Pratt made a few efforts,
                              proved its
                              inelastic properties, and presently lounged out again.

                              Newhaven had
                              shaken him.

                              he had come at last. There was death in the air. A whisper of death stole across the
                              empty
                              fields and bare hill-side. The birds heard it and were silent. The November wind was
                              hurrying
                              round Westhope Abbey, shaking its bare trees.

                              He stood so long that the day died, and twilight began to rub out first the hills
                              and then the
                              long white lines of flooded meadow and blurred pollard willows. Presently the river
                              mist rose up
                              to meet the coming darkness. In the east, low and lurid, a tawny moon crept up the
                              livid sky.

                           <p id="d75437e6797">Lord Newhaven moved away from the window, where he had become a shadow among the shadows,
                              and sat
                              down in the dark at his writing-table.

                           <p id="d75437e6800">Presently he turned on the electric lamp at his elbow and took a letter out of his
                              pocket. The
                              circle of shaded light fell on his face as he read—the thin grave face, with the steady,
                              inscrutable eyes.

                           <p id="d75437e6803">He read the letter slowly, evidently not for the first time.</p>

                              the manner in
                              which our differences were settled. Personally, I consider the old<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="211" data-tei-n="210"> </a></span> arrangement to which you regretfully alluded at the time”—(“pistols

                              to think
                              so yourself, would it not be advisable to resort to it? Believing that the old arrangement
                              will
                              meet your wishes as fully as it does mine, I trust that you will entertain this suggestion,

                              that you will agree to a meeting with your own choice of weapons on any pretext you
                              may choose

                              there is only
                              a week left. If it were not for the scandal for the boys, and if I thought he would
                              really hold
                              to the compact, I would meet him, but 
                              <emph id="d75437e6816">he won't</emph>. He flinched when be drew lots. He
                              won't. He has courage enough to stand up in front of me for two minutes, and take
                              his chance,
                              but not to blow his own brains out. No. And if he knew what is in store for him if
                              he does not,
                              he would not have courage to face that either. Nor should I, if I were in his shoes,
                              poor devil.
                              The first six foot of earth would be good enough for me.”

                           <p id="d75437e6821">He threw the letter with its envelope into the fire and watched it burn.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6824">Then he took up the gold pen which his wife had given him, examined the nib, dipped

                              the post-box at his elbow, but in his pocket. “Loftus and I did him an ill turn when

                           <p id="d75437e6835">The letter took its own time, for it had to avoid possible pitfalls. It shunned the

                              the other Westhope letters, it avoided the village post-office, but after a day's
                              delay it was
                              launched, and lay among a hundred others in a station pillar-box. And then it hurried,
                              hurried,
                              as fast as express train could take it, till it reached its London address, and, went
                              softly
                              upstairs, and laid itself with a few others on Hugh's breakfast table.

                           <p id="d75437e6838">For many weeks since his visit at Wilderleigh, Hugh had been like a man in a boat
                              without oars,
                              drifting slowly, imperceptibly on the placid current of a mighty river, who far away
                              hears the
                              fall of Niagara droning like a bumble bee in a lily cup.

                           <p id="d75437e6842">Long ago, in the summer, he had recognised the sound, had realised the steep agony
                              towards which
                              the current was bearing him, and had struggled horribly, impotently, against the inevitable.
                              But
                              of late, though the sound was ever in his ears, welling up out of the blue distance,
                              he had
                              given up the useless struggle, and lay still in the sunshine watching the summer woods
                              slide
                              past, and the clouds sail away, always away and away, to the birthplace of the river,
                              to that
                              little fluttering pulse in the heart of the hills which a woman's hand might cover,
                              the infant
                              pulse of the great river to be.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6845">Hugh's thoughts went back like the clouds towards that tiny spring of passion in his
                              own life. He
                              felt that he could have forgiven it—and himself—if he had been swept into the vortex
                              of a
                              headlong mountain torrent leaping down its own wild water-way, carrying all before
                              it. Other men
                              he had seen who had been wrested off their feet, swept out of their own keeping by
                              such a
                              torrent on the steep hillside of their youth. But it had not been so with him. He
                              had walked<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="213" data-tei-n="212"> </a></span> more cautiously than they. As he walked he had stopped to
                              look at the little thread of water which came bubbling up out of its white pebbles.
                              It was so
                              pretty, it was so feeble, it was so clear. Involuntarily he followed it, watched it
                              grow, amused
                              himself half contemptuously with it, helped its course by turning obstacles from its
                              path. It
                              never rushed. It never leaped. It was a toy. The day came when it spread itself safe
                              and shallow
                              on level land and he embarked upon it. But he was quickly tired of it. It was beginning
                              to run
                              muddily through a commonplace country, past squalid polluting towns and villages.
                              The hills were
                              long since gone. He turned to row to the shore. And behold his oars were gone! He
                              had been
                              trapped to his destruction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6850">Hugh had never regarded seriously his intrigue with Lady Newhaven. He had been attracted,
                              excited, partially, half-willingly enslaved. He had thought at the time that he loved
                              her, and
                              that supposition had confirmed him in his cheap cynicism about woman. This, then,
                              was her paltry
                              little court, where man offered mock homage, and where she played at being queen.
                              Hugh had made
                              the discovery that love was a much overrated passion. He had always supposed so, but
                              when he
                              tired of Lady Newhaven he was sure of it. His experience was, after all, only the
                              same as that
                              which many men acquire by marriage, and hold unshaken through long and useful lives.
                              But Hugh
                              had not been able to keep the treasures of this early experience. It had been rendered
                              worthless, perhaps rather contemptible by a later one, that of falling in love with
                              Rachel, and
                              the astonishing discovery that he was in love for the first time. He had sold his
                              birthright for
                              a mess of red pottage, as surely as any man or woman who marries for money or liking.
                              He had not
                              believed in his birthright, and holding it to be worthless, had given it to the first
                              person who
                              had offered him anything in exchange.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6853">His whole soul had gradually hardened itself against Lady Newhaven. If he had loved
                              her, he said
                              to himself, he could<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="214" data-tei-n="213"> </a></span> have borne his fate. But the play had not
                              been worth the candle. His position was damnable, but that he could have borne—at
                              least so he
                              thought if he had had his day. But he had not had it. That thought rankled. To be
                              hounded out of
                              life because he had mistaken paper-money for real was not only unfair, it was grotesque.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6858">Gradually, however, Hugh forgot his smouldering hate of Lady Newhaven, his sense of
                              injustice and
                              anger against fate, he forgot everything in his love for Rachel. It became the only
                              reality of
                              his life.

                           <p id="d75437e6861">He had remained in London throughout October and November, cancelling all his engagements
                              because
                              she was there. What her work was he vaguely apprehended: that she was spending herself
                              and part
                              of her colossal fortune in the East End, but he took no interest in it. He was incapable
                              of
                              taking more interests into his life at this time. He passed many quiet evenings with
                              her in the
                              house in Park Lane which she had lately bought. The little secretary who lived with
                              her had
                              always a faint smile and more writing to do than usual on the evenings when he dined
                              with
                              them.

                           <p id="d75437e6865">A great peace was over all their intercourse. Perhaps it was the hush before the storm,
                              the
                              shadow of which was falling, falling, with each succeeding day across the minds of
                              both. Once
                              only a sudden gust of emotion stirred the quiet air, but it dropped again immediately.
                              It came
                              with the hour when Hugh confessed to her the blot upon his past. The past was taking
                              upon itself
                              ever an uglier and more repulsive aspect as he saw more of Rachel. It was hard to
                              put into
                              words, but he spoke of it. The spectre of love rose like a ghost between them as they
                              looked
                              earnestly at each other, each pale even in the ruddy firelight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6868">Hugh was truthful in intention. He was determined he would never lie to Rachel. He
                              implied an
                              intrigue with a married woman, a deviation not only from morality but from honour.
                              More he did
                              not say. But as he looked at her strained face it seemed to him that she expected
                              something<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="215" data-tei-n="214"> </a></span> more. A dreadful silence fell between them when he had
                              finished. Had she then no word for him. Her eyes, mute, imploring, dark with an agony
                              of
                              suspense, met his for a second and fell instantly. She did not speak. Her silence
                              filled him
                              with despair. He got up. “It's getting late. I must go,” he stammered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6873">She rose mechanically and put out her hand.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6876">“May I come again?” he said, holding it more tightly than he knew and looking intently
                              at her.
                              Was he going to be dismissed?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6879">The pain he caused her hand recalled her to herself. A look of bewilderment crossed
                              her face, and
                              then she realised his suspense and said gravely, “You may come again.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6882">He kissed the hand he held, and as he did so he knew for the first time that she loved
                              him. But
                              he could not speak of love after what he had just told her. He looked back when he
                              reached the
                              door and saw her standing where he had left her. She had raised the hand he had kissed
                              to her
                              lips.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6886">That was three days ago. Since then he had not dared to go and see her. He could not
                              ask her to
                              marry him when he was within a few days of the time when he was bound in so-called
                              honour to
                              give Lord Newhaven satisfaction. He certainly could not be in her presence again without
                              asking
                              her. The shadows of the last weeks had suddenly become ghastly realities once more.
                              The roar of
                              Niagara drowned all other sounds. What was he going to do? What was he going to do
                              in the
                              predicament towards which he had been drifting so long, which was now actually upon
                              him? Who
                              shall say what horror, what agony of mind, what frenzied searching for a way of escape,
                              what
                              anguish of baffled love crowded in on Hugh's mind during those last days? At the last
                              moment he
                              caught at a straw, and wrote to Lord Newhaven offering to fight him. He did not ask
                              himself what
                              he should do if Lord Newhaven refused. But when Lord Newhaven did refuse, his determination,
                              long unconsciously<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="216" data-tei-n="215"> </a></span> fostered, sprang full-grown into existence
                              in a sudden access of passionate anger and blind rage.

                              perceptibly during these last weeks. Her strong white hands became thinner, her lustreless
                              eyes
                              and haggard face betrayed her. In years gone by she had said to herself, when a human
                              love had
                              failed her, “I will never put myself through this torture a second time. Whatever
                              happens I will
                              not endure it again.”

                           <p id="d75437e6919">And now she was enduring it again, though in a different form. There is an element
                              of mother love
                              in the devotion which some women give to men. In the first instance it had opened
                              the door of
                              Rachel's heart to Hugh, and had gradually merged with other feelings and deepened
                              into the
                              painful love of a woman not in her first youth for a man of whom she is not sure.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6923">Rachel was not sure of Hugh. Of his love for her she was sure, but not of the man
                              himself, the
                              gentle, refined, lovable nature that mutely worshipped and clung to her. She could
                              not repulse
                              him any more than she could repulse a child. But through all her knowledge of him,
                              the knowledge
                              of love—the only true knowledge of our fellow creatures—a thread of doubtful anxiety
                              was
                              interwoven. She could form some idea how men like Dick, Lord Newhaven, or the Bishop
                              would act
                              in given circumstances, but she could form no definite idea how Hugh would act in
                              the same
                              circumstances. Yet she knew Hugh a thousand times better than any of the others. Why
                              was this?
                              Many women before Rachel have sought diligently<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="218" data-tei-n="217"> </a></span> to find, and
                              have shut their eyes diligently, lest they should discover what it is that is dark
                              to them in
                              the character of the man they love.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6928">Perhaps Rachel half knew all the time the subtle inequality in Hugh's character. Perhaps
                              she
                              loved him all the better for it. Perhaps she knew that if he had been without a certain
                              undefinable weakness he would not have been drawn towards her strength. She was stronger
                              than
                              he, and perhaps she loved him more than she could have loved an equal.
                           </p>

                              <foreign id="d75437e6933" xml:lang="fre">Les esprits faibles ne sont jamais sincères</foreign>.” She had come
                              across that sentence one day in a book she was reading, and had turned suddenly blind
                              and cold
                              with anger. “He is sincere,” she said fiercely, as if repelling an accusation. “He
                              would never
                              deceive me.” But no one had accused Hugh.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6937">The same evening he made the confession for which she had waited so long. As he began
                              to speak an
                              intolerable suspense, like a new and acute form of a familiar disease, lay hold on
                              her. Was he
                              going to live or die? She should know at last. Was she to part with him, to bury love
                              for the
                              second time, or was she to keep him, to be his wife, the mother of his children?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6940">As he went on, his language becoming more confused, she hardly listened to him. She
                              had known all
                              that too long. She had forgiven it, not without tears; but still, she had forgiven
                              it long ago.
                              Then he stopped. It seemed to Rachel as if she had reached a moment in life which
                              she could not
                              bear. She waited, but still he did not speak. Then she was not to know. She was to
                              be ground
                              between the millstones of four more dreadful days and nights. She suddenly became
                              aware, as she
                              stared at Hugh's blanching face, that he believed she was about to dismiss him. The
                              thought had
                              never entered her mind.

                           <p id="d75437e6943">“Do you not know that I love you?” she said silently to him as he kissed her hand.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6947">When he had left her a gleam of comfort came to her, the only gleam that lightened
                              the days and
                              nights that followed. It was not his fault if he had made a half confession. If he<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="219" data-tei-n="218"> </a></span> had gone on, and had told her of the drawing of lots, and which had
                              drawn the fatal lot, he would have been wanting in sense of honour. He owed it to
                              the man he had
                              injured to reserve entire secrecy.

                           <p id="d75437e6952">“He told me of the sin which might affect my marrying him,” said Rachel, “but the

                              nothing to do with me. He was right not to speak of it. If he had told me, and then
                              a few days
                              afterwards Lord Newhaven had committed suicide, he would know I should put two and

                              ought to do.
                              But if Hugh were the man who had to kill himself, he might have told me so without
                              a breach of
                              confidence, because then I should never have guessed who the others were. If he were
                              the man he
                              could have told me, he certainly 
                              <emph id="d75437e6954">would</emph> have told me, for it could have done no harm
                              to any one. Surely Lady Newhaven must be right when she was so certain that her husband
                              had
                              drawn the short lighter. And she herself had gained the same impression from what
                              Hugh had
                              vaguely said at Wilderleigh. But what are impressions, suppositions, except the food
                              of
                              suspense. Rachel sighed and took up her burden as best she could. Hugh's confession
                              had at least
                              one source of comfort in it, deadly cold comfort if he were about to leave her. She
                              knew that
                              night as she lay awake that she had not quite trusted him up till now, by the sense
                              of entire
                              trust and faith in him which rose up to meet his self-accusation. What might have
                              turned away
                              Rachel's heart from him had had the opposite effect. “He told me the worst of himself,
                              though he
                              risked losing me by doing it. He wished me to know before he asked me to marry him.
                              Though he
                              acted dishonourably once he is an honourable man. He has shown himself upright in
                              his dealing
                              with me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6958">Hugh came back no more after that evening. Rachel told herself she knew why, she understood.
                              He
                              could not speak of love and marriage when the man he had injured was on the brink
                              of death. Her
                              heart stood still when she thought of Lord Newhaven, the gentle, kindly man who was
                              almost
                              her<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="220" data-tei-n="219"> </a></span> friend, and who was playing with such quiet dignity a
                              losing game. Hugh had taken from him his wife, and by that act was now taking from
                              him his life
                              too.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e6963">“It was an even chance,” she groaned. “Hugh is not responsible for his death. Oh,
                              my God! At
                              least he is not responsible for that. It might have been he who had to die instead
                              of Lord
                              Newhaven. But if it 
                              <emph id="d75437e6965">is</emph> he, surely he could not leave me without a word. If it
                              
                              <emph id="d75437e6968">is</emph> he, he would have come bid me good-bye. He cannot go down into silence
                              without a word. If it 
                              <emph id="d75437e6971">is</emph> he, he will come yet.”

                           <p id="d75437e6975">She endured through the two remaining days, turning faint with terror each time the

                              seemed to pervade the long dim lines of the gardens, and to be gathered into the solemn
                              arches
                              of the ruins against the darkening sky. Through the low doorway a faint light of welcome
                              peered.
                              As she drove up she was aware of two tall figures pacing amicably together in the
                              dusk. As she
                              passed them she heard Lord Newhaven's low laugh at something his companion said.

                           <p id="d75437e7007">A sense of unreality seized her. It was not the world which was out of joint, which
                              was rushing
                              to its destruction. It must be she who was mad, stark mad to have believed these chimeras.

                           <p id="d75437e7011">As she got out of the carriage a step came lightly along the gravel, and Lord Newhaven
                              emerged
                              into the little ring of light by the archway.

                              unwell, and expecting you anxiously. She told me she had sent for you.”

                           <p id="d75437e7017">All was unreal—the familiar rooms and passages, the flickering light of the wood fire
                              in the
                              drawing-room, the darkened room, into which Rachel stole softly and knelt down beside
                              a
                              trembling white figure, which held her with a drowning clutch.

                           <p id="d75437e7020">“I will be in the drawing-room after dinner,” Lady Newhaven whispered hoarsely. “I

                              down. I can't bear to see him.”

                              nearly choked

                              dressed for
                              dinner. “How shall I bear it when she speaks of him? How shall I go through with it?”

                           <p id="d75437e7032">Presently she was dining alone with Lord Newhaven. He mentioned that it was Dick Vernon
                              with whom
                              he had been walking when she arrived. Dick was staying in Southminster for business
                              combined
                              with hunting, and had ridden over. Lord Newhaven looked furtively at Rachel as he
                              mentioned
                              Dick. Her indifference was evidently genuine.

                           <p id="d75437e7035">“She has not grown thin and parted with what little looks she possessed on Dick's
                              account,” he
                              said to himself; and the remembrance slipped across his mind of Hugh's first word
                              when he
                              recovered consciousness after drowning—“Rachel.”

                           <p id="d75437e7038">“I would have asked Dick to dine,” continued Lord Newhaven, when the servants had
                              gone, “but I
                              thought two was company and three none, and that it was not fair on you and Violet
                              to have him
                              on your hands, as I am obliged to go to London on business by the night express.”

                           <p id="d75437e7041">He was amazed at the instantaneous effect of his words.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7044">Rachel's face became suddenly livid, and she sank back in her chair. He saw that it
                              was only by a
                              supreme effort that she prevented herself from fainting. The truth flashed into his
                              mind.

                              tied, has
                              actually confided in her. And she and Scarlett are in love with each other, and the
                              suspense is
                              wearing her out.”

                           <p id="d75437e7051">He looked studiously away from her, and continued a desultory conversation, but his
                              face
                              darkened.

                              glued on the crystallised cherries. Rachel had recovered herself, and she watched
                              the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="223" data-tei-n="222"> </a></span> children and their father with a pain at her heart which was worse
                              than the faintness.

                           <p id="d75437e7059">She had been unable to believe that if Lord Newhaven had drawn the short lighter he
                              would remain
                              quietly here over the dreadful morrow, under the same roof as Teddy and Pauly. Oh!
                              surely
                              nothing horrible could happen so near them. Yet he seemed to have no intention of

                              Westhope. Then perhaps he had not drawn the short lighter after all. At the moment

                              suspense, momentarily lulled, was once more rising hideous, colossal, he casually
                              mentioned that
                              he was leaving by the night train. The reason was obvious. The shock of relief almost
                              stunned
                              her.

                              miserable eyes as he divided the cherries equally between the boys. She had dreaded
                              going
                              upstairs to Lady Newhaven, but anything was better than remaining in the dining-room.
                              She rose
                              hurriedly, and the boys raced to the door and struggled which should open it for her.

                              was not he, after all; and yet little things made me feel sure it was, and that he
                              was only
                              waiting to do it before me and the children. I have been so horribly frightened. Oh!
                              if he might
                              only go away, and that I might never, never look upon his face again.”

                              what to pack, that he should not want him to accompany him, and then went to his sitting-room
                              on
                              the ground floor.

                              him, and if
                              she marries him she will reform him. Is he going to escape altogether in this world
                              and the
                              next, if there is a next? Is there no justice anywhere? Perhaps at this moment he
                              is thinking
                              that he has salved his conscience by offering to fight, and that, after all, I can't
                              do anything
                              to prevent his living and marrying her if he chooses. He knows well enough I shall
                              not touch
                              him, or sue for a divorce, for fear of the scandal. He thinks he has me there. And
                              he is right.
                              But he is mistaken if he thinks I can do nothing. I may as well go up to London and
                              see for
                              myself whether he is still on his feet to-morrow night. It is a mere formality, but
                              I will do
                              it. I might have guessed that she would try to smirch her own name, and the boys through
                              her, if
                              she had the chance. She will defeat me yet, unless I am careful. Oh! ye gods! why
                              did I marry a
                              fool who does not even know her own interests. If I had life over again I would marry
                              a Becky
                              Sharp, any she-devil incarnate, if only she had brains. One cannot circumvent a fool
                              because one
                              can't foresee their line of action. But Miss West, for a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="224"> </a></span>

                              tell
                              her himself in an access of moral spring cleaning preparatory to matrimony? No. He
                              may have told
                              her that he had got into trouble with some woman, but not about the drawing of lots.
                              Whatever
                              his faults are, he has the instincts of a gentleman, and his mouth is shut. I can
                              trust him like
                              myself there. But she is not for him. He may think he will marry her, but I draw the
                              line there.
                              Violet and I have other views for him. He can live if he wants to, and apparently
                              he does want
                              to, though whether he will continue to want to is another question. But he shall not
                              have
                              Rachel. She must marry Dick.”

                              butler came round the corner to announce the carriage.

                              arrived, and the old baby was learning, not in silence, what kings and ministers undergo

                              they are deposed. Hester had never greatly cared for the old baby. She was secretly
                              afraid of
                              it. But in its hour of adversity she took to it, and she and Regie spent many hours

                              for the arrival of the little chrysalis upstairs.

                              ago—but how, when he was about my age, he lost his eldest boy, and how he always remembered
                              Regie in his prayers, and I must keep up a good heart. We shook hands,” said Mr. Gresley.
                              “I
                              sometimes think Walsh means well, and that he may be a good-hearted man after all.”

                              pierced to a thin layer of humility. Hester knew that that layer was only momentarily

                              and that the old self would infallibly reassert itself, but the momentary glimpse

                              that matters. Is Hester in? I've two notes for her. One from Brown, and one from the

                              my orders are to take her back with me. That is why the Bishop sent the carriage.”

                           <p id="d75437e7278">“I am afraid Hester will hardly care to leave us at present,” said Mr. Gresley. “My

                              looking full at
                              Mr. Gresley in an unpleasant manner. “I'm not one that holds that parsons should have
                              their own
                              way in everything. I've seen too much of missionaries. I just shove out curates and
                              vicars and
                              all that small fry if they get in my way. But when they break out in buttons and gaiters,
                              by
                              Jove, I knock under to them, at least, I do to men like the Bishop. He knows a thing
                              or two. He
                              has told me not to come back without Hester, and I'm not going to. Ah! There she is
                              in the
                              garden.” Dick's large back had been turned towards the window, but he had seen the
                              reflection of
                              a passing figure in the glass of a framed testimonial which occupied a prominent place
                              on the
                              study wall, and he at once marched out into the garden and presented the letters to
                              Hester.

                              to have grown
                              like a Buddhist into his tree. She was reluctant, would think it over, &amp;c. But Dick,

                              one glance at her strained face, was obdurate. He would hear no reason. He would not

                              that's about
                              all he's up to. He doesn't take enough exercise.”

                              second day, the first day of December, was waning to its close. How Rachel had lived
                              through
                              them she knew not. The twenty-ninth had been the appointed day. Both women had endured
                              till
                              then, feeling that that day would make an end. Neither had contemplated the possibility
                              of
                              hearing nothing for two days more. Long afterwards in quiet years Rachel tried to
                              recall those
                              two days and nights. But memory only gave lurid glimpses as of lightning across darkness.
                              In one
                              of those glimpses she recalled that Lady Newhaven had become ill, that the doctor
                              had been sent
                              for, that she had been stupefied with narcotics. In another she was walking in the
                              desolate
                              frost-nipped gardens, and the two boys were running towards her across the grass.

                           <p id="d75437e7399">There had been wind all day, a high, dreadful wind, which had accompanied all the
                              nightmare of
                              the day as a wail accompanies pain. But now it had dropped with the sun, who was setting
                              with
                              little pageant across the level land. The whole sky, from north to south, from east
                              to west, was
                              covered with a wind-threshed floor of thin wan clouds, and shreds of clouds, through
                              which, as
                              through a veil, the steadfast face of the heaven beyond looked down.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7402">And suddenly, from east to west, from north to south, as far as the trees and wolds
                              in the dim,
                              forgotten east, the exhausted livid clouds blushed wave on wave, league on league,
                              red as the
                              heart of a rose. The wind-whipped earth was still. The trees held their breath. Very
                              black
                              against the glow the carved cross on the adjoining gable stood out. And in another
                              moment the
                              mighty tide of colour went as it had come, swiftly ebbing across its infinite shores
                              of sky. And
                              the waiting night came down suddenly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7405">“Oh! my God,” said Rachel, stretching out her hands to ward off the darkness. “Not
                              another night.
                              I cannot bear another night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7408">A slow step came along the gravel; it passed below the window and stopped at the door.
                              Some one
                              knocked. Rachel tore open the throat of her gown. She was suffocating. Her long-drawn
                              breathing
                              seemed to deaden all other sounds. Nevertheless she heard it—the faint footfall of
                              some one in
                              the hall, a distant opening and shutting of doors. A vague, indescribable tremor seemed
                              to run
                              through the house.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7411">She stole out of her room and down the passage. At Lady Newhaven's door her French
                              maid was
                              hesitating, her hand on the handle.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7415">Below, on the stairs, stood a clergyman and the butler.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7418">“I am the bearer of sad tidings,” said the clergyman. Rachel recognised him as the
                              Archdeacon at
                              whom Lord<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="236" data-tei-n="235"> </a></span> Newhaven had so often laughed. “Perhaps you would
                              prepare Lady Newhaven before I break them to her.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7423">The door was suddenly opened, and Lady Newhaven stood in the doorway. One small clenched
                              hand
                              held together the long white dressing-gown which she had hastily flung round her,
                              while the
                              other was outstretched against the door-post. She swayed as she stood. Morphia and
                              terror burned
                              in her glassy eyes fixed in agony upon the clergyman. The light in the hall below
                              struck upwards
                              at her colourless face. In later days this was the picture which Lady Newhaven recalled
                              to mind
                              as the most striking of the whole series.

                           <p id="d75437e7426">“Tell her,” said Rachel, sharply.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7429">The Archdeacon advanced.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7432">“Prepare yourself, dear Lady Newhaven,” he said sonorously. “Our dear friend, Lord
                              Newhaven, has
                              met with a serious accident. Er—the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed
                              be the name
                              of the Lord.”

                           <p id="d75437e7436">“Is he dead?” whispered Lady Newhaven.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7439">The Archdeacon bowed his head.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e7445">Rachel put her arms round the tottering, distraught figure, drew it gently back into
                              the room,
                              and closed the door behind her.

                              He has played his losing game to the bitter end, weighing each move. None of the papers
                              even
                              hint that his death was not an accident. He has provided against that.”

                           <p id="d75437e7482">The butler received a note from Lord Newhaven the morning after his death, mentioning
                              the train
                              by which he should return to Westhope that day, and ordering a carriage to meet him.
                              A great
                              doctor made public the fact that Lord Newhaven had consulted him the day before about
                              the
                              attacks of vertigo from which it appeared he had suffered of late. A similar attack
                              seemed to
                              have seized upon him while waiting at Clapham Junction when the down express thundered
                              past. The
                              few who saw him said that, as he was pacing the empty platform, he staggered suddenly
                              as the
                              train was sweeping up behind him, put his hand to his head, and stumbled over the
                              edge on to the
                              line. Death was instantaneous. Only his wife and one other woman knew that it was
                              premeditated.

                           <p id="d75437e7485">“The only thing I cannot understand about it,” said Rachel to herself, “is why a man,
                              who from
                              first to last could act with such caution, and with such deliberate determination,
                              should have
                              been two days late. The twenty-ninth of November was the last day of the five months,
                              and he
                              died on<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="238" data-tei-n="237"> </a></span> the afternoon of December the first. Why did he wait
                              two days after he left Westhope? I should have thought he would have been the last
                              man in the
                              world to overstep the allotted time by so much as an hour. Yet nevertheless he waited
                              two whole
                              days. I don't understand it.”

                           <p id="d75437e7490">After an interminable interval Lord Newhaven's luggage returned, the familiar portmanteaux

                              dressing-bag, and even the novel which he was reading when he left Westhope, with
                              the mark still
                              in it. All came back. And a coffin came back, too, and was laid before the little
                              altar in the
                              disused chapel.

                              Lady
                              Newhaven to Rachel, “but I dare not before. I can't believe he is really dead. And
                              they say
                              somebody ought to look, just to verify. I know it is always done. Dear Rachel, would

                              fellows, went alone into the chapel, and stood a long time looking down upon the muffled
                              figure,
                              the garment of flesh which the soul had so deliberately rent and flung aside.

                              the weariness, the indifference, the impatient patience, these were gone, these were
                              indeed
                              dead. The sharp thin face knew them no more. It looked intently, unflinchingly through
                              its
                              half-closed eyes into the beyond which some call death, which some call life.

                           <p id="d75437e7503">“Forgive him,” said Rachel, kneeling beside the coffin. “My friend, forgive him. He
                              has injured
                              you, I know. And your just revenge, for you thought it just, has failed to reach him.
                              But the
                              time for vengeance has passed. The time for forgiveness has come. Forgive my poor
                              Hugh, who will
                              never forgive himself. Do you not see now, you who see so much, that it was harder
                              for him than
                              for you; that it would have been the easier part for him if he had been the one to
                              draw death,
                              to have atoned to you for his sin against you by his<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="239" data-tei-n="238"> </a></span> death,
                              instead of feeling, as he always must, that your stroke failed, and that he has taken
                              your life
                              from you as well as your honour. Forgive him,” said Rachel, over and over again.

                              father
                              would have been, but Lady Newhaven was obdurate.

                              brought them back towards bedtime, with a dancing doll he had made for them, and a

                              cut out of cork. They met Rachel and the governess in the garden on their return,
                              and flew to
                              them with their trophies.

                              was why I liked him. He was hard to make a friend of or an enemy, but when he once
                              did either he
                              never let go.”

                              her
                              behaviour was perfect. She, Angélique, knew what her own part should be, and played
                              it with
                              effusion. She suffered no one to come into the room. She, who would never do a hand's
                              turn for
                              the English servants, put on coal with her own hands. She took the lamps from the
                              footman at the
                              door. Presently she brought in a little tray with food and wine, and softly besought
                              “Miladi” to
                              eat. Perhaps the mistress and maid understood each other. Lady Newhaven impatiently
                              shook her
                              head, and Angélique wrung her hands. In the end Angélique prevailed.

                              coaxing, she had drunk a glass of champagne.

                              prolonged
                              beyond its time, was over. The shock of its ending which shattered her at first, was
                              over too.
                              She was beginning to breathe again, to take comfort once more: not the comfort that
                              Rachel had
                              tried so hard to give her, but the comfort of feeling that happiness and ease were
                              in store for

                              together, and they need not come home for the holidays just at first. I don't think

                           <p id="d75437e7660">Lady Newhaven's thoughts travelled back in spite of herself to her marriage with Lord
                              Newhaven,
                              and the humble, boundless admiration which she had accepted as a matter of course,
                              which had
                              been extinguished so entirely, so inexplicably, soon after marriage, which had been
                              succeeded by
                              still more inexplicable paroxysms of bitterness and contempt. Other men, Lady Newhaven
                              reflected, respected and loved their wives even after they lost their complexions,
                              and—she had
                              kept hers. Why had he been different from others? It was impossible to account for
                              men and their
                              ways. And how he had sneered at her when she talked gravely to him, especially on
                              religious
                              subjects. Decidedly, Edward had been very difficult, until he settled down into the
                              sarcastic
                              indifference that had marked all his intercourse with her after the first year.

                           <p id="d75437e7664">“Hugh will never be like that,” she said to herself, “and he will never laugh at me
                              for being
                              religious. He understands me as Edward never did. And I will be married in a pale
                              shade of
                              violet velvet trimmed with ermine, as it will be a winter wedding. And my bouquet
                              shall be of
                              Neapolitan violets to match my name.”

                           <p id="d75437e7667">“May I come in?” said Rachel's voice.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7670">“Do,” said Lady Newhaven, but without enthusiasm.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7673">She no longer needed Rachel. The crisis during which she had clung to her was past.
                              What
                              shipwrecked seaman casts a second thought after his rescue to the log which supported<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="244" data-tei-n="243"> </a></span> him upon a mountainous sea. Rachel interrupted pleasant thoughts.
                              Lady Newhaven observed that her friend's face had grown unbecomingly thin, and that
                              what little
                              colour there was in it was faded. “She is the same age as I am, but she looks much
                              older,” said
                              Lady Newhaven to herself, adding aloud:

                           <p id="d75437e7681">“Every one has gone,” said Rachel, “and I have had a telegram from Lady Trentham.
                              She has reached
                              Paris, and will be here to-morrow afternoon.”

                           <p id="d75437e7688">“So now,” said Rachel, sitting down near the sofa with a set countenance, “I shall
                              feel quite
                              happy about leaving you.”

                           <p id="d75437e7691">“Must you go?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7694">“I must. I have arranged to leave by the seven-thirty to-morrow morning. I think it
                              will be
                              better if we say good-bye over night.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7697">“I shall miss you dreadfully.” Lady Newhaven perceived suddenly, and with resentment,
                              that Rachel
                              was anxious to go.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7700">“I do not think you will miss me.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7704">“I don't know why you say that. You have been so dear and sympathetic. You understand
                              me much
                              better than mamma. And then mamma was always so fond of Edward. She cried for joy
                              when I was
                              engaged to him. She said her only fear was that I should not appreciate him. She never
                              could see
                              that he was in fault. I must say he was kind to her. I do wish I was not obliged to
                              have her
                              now. I know she will do nothing but talk of him. Now I come to think of it, do stay,
                              Rachel.”

                              Rachel. I believe he is a good sort of young man—not the kind I could ever have looked
                              at, but
                              what does that matter? I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="245" data-tei-n="244"> </a></span> am afraid it has rankled in your mind
                              that I once warned you against him. But, after all, it is your affair, not mine.”

                           <p id="d75437e7718">Lady Newhaven sighed impatiently. She did not want to talk of Rachel's affairs. She
                              wanted, now
                              the funeral was over, to talk of her own. She often said there were few people with
                              less
                              curiosity about others than herself.

                              lots. I always thought Edward drew the short lighter. It was so like him to turn it
                              off with a
                              laugh.”

                              I did try
                              to be a friend. I may have failed, but—I did my best.”

                           <p id="d75437e7737">A great compassion flooded Rachel's heart for this poor creature, with its house of

                              her face became fixed as a surgeon's who gets out his knife.

                              I have gradually become attached to him.”

                              She had
                              confided her love to no one, not even to Hester; and to speak of it<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="246" data-tei-n="245"> </a></span> to Lady Newhaven had been like tearing the words out of herself with

                           <p id="d75437e7768">Rachel got up suddenly, and moved away to the fireplace. She felt it would be horribly
                              easy to

                              urgently that she might stay upon the hearthrug, that whatever happened she might
                              not go near
                              the sofa.

                           <p id="d75437e7791">Lady Newhaven threw herself back on the sofa. She laughed softly. A little mirror
                              hung tilted at
                              an angle which allowed her to see herself as she lay. She saw a very beautiful woman,
                              and then
                              she turned and looked at Rachel, who had no beauty as she understood it, and laughed
                              again.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7794">“My poor dear,” she said, in a voice that made Rachel wince, “Hugh is no better than
                              the worst.
                              He has made love to you

                              taken him seriously, like the dear simple woman you are. But he will never marry you.
                              You own he
                              has not proposed. Of course not. Men are like that. It is hateful of them, but they
                              will do it.
                              They are the vainest creatures in the world. Don't you see that the reason he has
                              not asked you
                              is because he knew that Edward had to—and that I should soon be free to marry him.
                              And Rachel,
                              you need not feel the least little bit humiliated, for I shan't tell a soul, and,
                              after all, he
                              loved me first.”

                              jealous of the past, cut to the heart every time she noticed that Lady Newhaven's

                              over her ears, and that she had taper fingers.

                              at all. I did as I would be done by. As I am starting early I think I will say good-night
                              and

                              the last hour of the last day was over, and the dawn which he had bound himself in
                              honour not to
                              see found him sitting alone in his room, where he had sat all night, horror fell upon
                              him at
                              what he had done. Now that its mire was upon him he saw by how foul, by how dastardly
                              a path he
                              had escaped.

                           <p id="d75437e7843">“To every coward safety, and afterwards his evil hour.” Hugh's evil hour had come.
                              But was he a
                              coward? Men not braver than he have earned the Victoria Cross, have given up their
                              lives freely
                              for others. Hugh had it in him to do as well as any man in hot blood, but not in cold.
                              That was
                              where Lord Newhaven had the advantage of him. He had been overmatched from the first.
                              The strain
                              without had been greater than the power of resistance within. As the light grew, Hugh
                              tasted of
                              that cup which God holds to no man's lips—
                              <emph id="d75437e7845">remorse</emph>. Would the cup of death which he
                              had pushed aside have been more bitter?

                           <p id="d75437e7850">He took up his life like a thief. Was it not stolen? He could not bear his rooms.
                              He could not
                              bear the crowded streets. He could not bear the parks. He wandered aimlessly from
                              one to the
                              other, driven out of each in turn, consumed by the smouldering flame of his self-contempt.
                              Scorn
                              seemed written on the faces of the passers-by. As the day waned he found himself once
                              again for
                              the twentieth time in the park, pacing in “the dim persistent rain,” which had been
                              falling all
                              day.

                           <p id="d75437e7855">But he could not get away from the distant roar of the traffic. He heard it everywhere,
                              like the
                              Niagara which he had indeed escaped, but the sound of which would be in his ears till
                              he died.
                              He drew nearer and nearer to the traffic, and stood still in the rain listening to
                              it intently.
                              Might one of those thousand wheels be even now bringing his enemy towards him, to
                              force him to
                              keep his unspoken word. Hugh had not realised that his worst enemy was he who stood
                              with him in
                              the rain.

                              to their
                              parks and grass, as if they dimly foresaw the inevitable time coming when they too
                              should toil,
                              and hate, and suffer, as they saw on all sides those stunted uprooted figures toil
                              and suffer,
                              which had once been trees like themselves. “We shall come to it,” they seemed to say,
                              shivering
                              in all their branches, as they peered through the iron rails at the stream of human
                              life, much
                              as man peers at a passing funeral.

                           <p id="d75437e7861">The early night drove Hugh back to the house. He found a note from a man who had rooms
                              above him
                              enclosing a theatre ticket, which at the last moment he had been prevented using.
                              He instantly
                              clutched at the idea of escaping from himself for a few hours at least. He hastily
                              changed his
                              wet clothes, ate the food that had been prepared for him, and hurried out once more.

                           <p id="d75437e7864">The play was “Julius Cæsar,” at Her Majesty's. He had seen it several times, but to-night
                              it
                              appealed to him as it had never done before. He hardly noticed the other actors. His
                              whole
                              interest centred in the awful figure of Cassius, splendid in its unswerving deathless
                              passion of
                              a great hate and a great love. His eyes never left the ruthless figure as it stood
                              in silence
                              with its unflinching eyes upon its victim. Had not Lord Newhaven thus watched him,
                              Hugh, ready
                              to strike when the hour came.

                           <p id="d75437e7868">The moment of the murder was approaching. Hugh held his breath. Cassius knelt with
                              the rest
                              before Cæsar. Hugh<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="250" data-tei-n="249"> </a></span> saw his hand seek the handle of his sword,
                              saw the end of the sheath tilt upwards under his robe as the blade slipped out of
                              it. Then came
                              the sudden outburst of animal ferocity long held in leash, of stab on stab, the self-recovery,
                              the cold stare at the dead figure with Cassius' foot upon its breast.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7873">For a moment the scene vanished. Hugh saw again the quiet study with its electric
                              reading-lamp,
                              the pistols over the mantelpiece, the tiger glint in Lord Newhaven's eyes. He was
                              like Cassius.
                              He, too, had been ready to risk life, everything in the prosecution of his hate.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7876">“He shall never stand looking down on my body,” said Hugh to himself, “with his cursed
                              foot upon
                              me.” And he realised that if he had been a worthier antagonist, that also might have
                              been. The
                              play dealt with men. Cassius and Lord Newhaven were men. But what was he?

                           <p id="d75437e7879">The fear of death leading the love of life by the hand took with shame a lower seat.
                              Hugh saw
                              them at last in their proper places. If he could have died then he would have died
                              cheerfully,
                              gladly, as he saw Cassius die by his own hand, counting death the little thing it
                              is.
                              Afterwards, as he stood in the crowd near the door, where the rain was delaying the
                              egress, he
                              saw suddenly Lord Newhaven's face watching him. His heart leapt. “He has come to make
                              me keep my
                              word,” he said to himself, the exaltation of the play still upon him. “I will not
                              avoid him. Let
                              him do it,” and he pressed forward towards him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7882">Lord Newhaven looked fixedly at him for a moment, and then disappeared.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7885">“He will follow me and stab me in the back,” said Hugh. “I will walk home by the street
                              where the
                              pavement is up, and let him do it.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7889">He walked slowly, steadily on, looking neither to right nor left. Presently he came
                              to a barrier
                              across a long deserted street, with a red lamp keeping guard over it. He walked deliberately
                              up
                              it. He had no fear. In the middle he stopped, and fumbled in his pocket for a cigarette.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="251" data-tei-n="250"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7894">A soft step was coming up behind him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7897">“It will be quickly over,” he said to himself. “Wait. Don't look round.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7900">He stood motionless. His silver cigarette case dropped from his hand. He looked at
                              it for a
                              second, forgetting to pick it up. A dirty hand suddenly pounced upon it, and a miserable
                              ragged
                              figure flew past him up the street. Hugh stared after it bewildered, and then looked
                              round. The
                              street was quite empty. He drew a long breath, and something between relief and despair
                              took
                              hold of him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7903">“Then he does not want to after all. He has not even followed me. Why was he there?
                              He was
                              waiting for me. What horrible revenge is he planning against me. Is he laying a second
                              trap for
                              me?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7907">The following night Hugh read in the evening papers that Lord Newhaven had been accidentally
                              killed on the line. The revulsion of feeling was too sudden, too overwhelming. He
                              could not bear
                              it. He could not live through it. He flung himself on his face upon the floor, and
                              sobbed as if
                              his heart would break.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7910">The cyclone of passion which had swept Hugh into its vortex spent itself and him,
                              and flung him
                              down at last. How long a time elapsed he never knew between the moment when he read
                              the news of
                              the accident and the moment when shattered, exhausted, disfigured by emotion, he raised
                              himself
                              to his feet. He opened the window, and the night air laid its cool mother touch upon
                              his face
                              and hands. The streets were silent. The house was silent. He leaned with closed eyes
                              against the
                              window post. Time passed by on the other side.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7913">And after a while angels came and ministered to him. Thankfulness came softly, gently,
                              to take
                              his shaking hand in hers. The awful past was over. A false step, a momentary giddiness
                              on the
                              part of his enemy, and the hideous strangling meshes of the past had fallen from him
                              at a touch,
                              as if they<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="252" data-tei-n="251"> </a></span> had never wrapped him round. Lord Newhaven was gone
                              to return no more. The past went with him. Dead men tell no tales. No one knew of
                              the godless
                              compact between them, and of how he, Hugh, had failed to keep to it, save they two
                              alone. He and
                              one other. And that other was dead, was dead.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7918">Hope came next, shyly, silently, still pale from the embrace of her sister Despair,
                              trimming anew
                              her little lamp, which the labouring breath of Despair had well-nigh blown out. She
                              held the
                              light before Hugh, shading it with her veil, for his eyes were dazed with long gazing
                              into
                              darkness. She turned it faintly upon the future, and he looked where the light fell.
                              And the
                              light grew.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7921">He had a future once more. He had been given that second chance for which he had so
                              yearned. His
                              life was his own once more: not the shamed life in death, worse than death of the
                              last two days,
                              but his own to take up again, to keep, to enjoy, best of all to use worthily. No horrible
                              constraint was upon him to lay it down, or to live in torment because he still held
                              it. He was
                              free, free to marry Rachel whom he loved, and who loved him. He saw his life with
                              her. Hope
                              smiled, and turned up her light. It was too bright. Hugh hid his face in his hands.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7924">And last of all, dwarfing Hope, came a divine constraining presence who ever stretches
                              out strong
                              hands to them that fall, who alone sets the stumbling feet upon the upward path. Repentance
                              came
                              to Hugh at last. In all this long time she had not come while he was suffering, while
                              smouldering Remorse had darkened his soul with smoke. But in this quiet hour she came
                              and stood
                              beside him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7928">Hugh had in the past leaned heavily on extenuating circumstances. He had made many
                              excuses for
                              himself. But now he made none. Perhaps for the first time in his life, under the pressure
                              of
                              that merciful, that benign hand, he was sincere with himself. He saw his conduct—that
                              easily
                              condoned conduct—as it was. Love and Repentance, are not these the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="253" data-tei-n="252"> </a></span> great teachers? Some of us so frame our lives that we never come face
                              to face with either, or with ourselves. Hugh came to himself at last. He saw how,
                              whether
                              detected or not, his sin had sapped his manhood, spread like a leaven of evil through
                              his whole
                              life, laid its hideous touch of desecration and disillusion even on his love for Rachel.
                              It had
                              tarnished his mind, his belief in others, his belief in good. These ideals, these
                              beliefs had
                              been his possession once, his birthright. He had sold his birthright for red pottage.
                              Until now
                              he had scorned the red pottage. Now he saw that his sin lay deeper, even in his original
                              scorn
                              of his birthright, his disbelief in the Divine Spirit Who dwells with man.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e7933">Nevertheless his just punishment had been remitted. Hitherto he had looked solely
                              at that
                              punishment, feeling that it was too great. He had prayed many times that he might
                              escape it. Now
                              for the first time he prayed that he might be forgiven.

                              are at their worst they generally take a turn for the better. This profound truth
                              was proving
                              itself equal to the occasion at Warpington Vicarage.

                              air had blown
                              back a faint colour into Regie's cheeks. The new baby's vaccination was ceasing to
                              cast a vocal
                              gloom over the thin-walled house. The old baby's whole attention was mercifully diverted
                              from
                              his wrongs to the investigation of that connection between a chair and himself, which
                              he
                              perceived the other children could assume at pleasure. He stood for hours looking
                              at his own
                              little chair, solemnly seating himself at long intervals where no chair was. But his
                              mind was
                              working, and work, as we know, is the panacea for mental anguish.

                              men which surprises people so much from things she has heard me say. She certainly

                              may as well skim it before it goes to the printers. I have always told her I did not

                              finding the right word. This gift Hester did not share with him. She often got hold

                              perceive that the French classics are only read for the sake of the hideous improprieties
                              contained in them. He had explained this to Hester, and was indignant that she had
                              continued to
                              read them just as frequently as before, even translating parts of some of them into

                              but as he
                              laid down the manuscript for a moment to rest his eyes he felt that he had reached
                              the limit of
                              Hester's powers, and that he could only attribute the last volume to the Evil One
                              himself.

                              and Mrs.

                              never-to-be-forgotten period before his ordination, when he had come in contact with
                              worldly
                              minds, and had had doubts as to the justice of eternal punishment. He was apt to speak
                              in after
                              years of the furnace through which he had passed, and from which nothing short of
                              a conversation
                              with a bishop had had power to save him, as a great experience which he could not
                              regret,
                              because it had brought him into sympathy with so many minds. As he often said in his
                              favourite
                              language of metaphor, he “had threshed out the whole subject of agnosticism, and could
                              consequently meet other minds still struggling in its turbid waves.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8222">But now again he was deeply perturbed, and it was difficult to see in what blessing
                              to his fellow
                              creatures this particular agitation would result. He walked with bent head for hours
                              in the
                              garden. He could not attend to his sermon, though it was Friday. He entirely forgot
                              his
                              Bible-class at the almshouses in the afternoon.

                           <p id="d75437e8226">Mrs. Gresley watched him from her bedroom window, where she was mending the children's
                              stockings.
                              At last she laid aside her work and went out.

                           <p id="d75437e8229">She might not be his mental equal. She might be unable, with her small feminine mind,
                              to fathom
                              the depths and heights of that great intelligence, but still she was his wife. Perhaps,
                              though
                              she did not know it, it troubled her to see<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="264" data-tei-n="263"> </a></span> him so absorbed in
                              his sister, for she was sure it was of Hester and her book that he was thinking. “I
                              am his
                              wife,” she said to herself, as she joined him in silence and passed her arm through
                              his. He
                              needed to be reminded of her existence. Mr. Gresley pressed it, and they took a turn
                              in
                              silence.

                           <p id="d75437e8234">He had not a high opinion of the feminine intellect. He was wont to say that he was
                              tired of most
                              women in ten minutes. But he had learnt to make an exception of his wife. What mind
                              does not
                              feel confidence in the sentiments of its echo?

                           <p id="d75437e8237">“I am greatly troubled about Hester,” he said at last.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8240">“It is not a new trouble,” said Mrs. Gresley. “I sometimes think, dearest, it is we
                              who are to
                              blame in having her to live with us. She is worldly—I suppose she can't help it—and
                              we are
                              unworldly. She is irreligious, and you are deeply religious. I wish I could say I
                              was too, but I
                              lag far behind you. And though I am sure she does her best—and so do we—her presence
                              is a
                              continual friction. I feel she always drags us down.”

                           <p id="d75437e8243">Mr. Gresley was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice the diffident plea
                              which his wife
                              was putting forward that Hester might cease to live with them.

                           <p id="d75437e8247">“I was not thinking of that,” he said, “so much as of this novel which she has written.
                              It is a
                              profane, immoral book, and will do incalculable harm if it is published.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8250">“I feel sure it will,” said Mrs. Gresley, who had not read it.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8253">“It is dreadfully coarse in places,” continued Mr. Gresley, who had the same opinion
                              of George
                              Eliot's works. “And I warned Hester most solemnly on that point when I found she had
                              begun
                              another book. I told her that I well knew that to meet the public taste it was necessary
                              to
                              interlard fiction with 
                              <foreign id="d75437e8255" xml:lang="fre">risqué</foreign> things in order to make it sell,
                              but that it was my earnest hope she would in future resist this temptation. She only
                              said that
                              if she introduced improprieties into her book in order to make money, in her opinion
                              she
                              deserved to be whipped in the public streets. She was very angry, I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="265" data-tei-n="264"> </a></span> remember, and became as white as a sheet, and I dropped the
                              subject.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8261">“She can't bear even the most loving word of advice,” said Mrs. Gresley.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8264">“She holds nothing sacred,” went on Mr. Gresley, remembering an unfortunate incident
                              in the
                              clergyman's career. “Her life here seems to have had no softening effect upon her.
                              She sneers
                              openly at religion. I never thought, I never allowed myself to think, that she was
                              so dead to
                              spiritual things as her book forces me to believe. Even her good people, her heroine,
                              have not a
                              vestige of religion, only a sort of vague morality, right for the sake of right, and
                              love
                              teaching people things; nothing real.”

                           <p id="d75437e8267">There was a moment's silence.</p>

                              one to look to for help and guidance but me. I am her only near relation. That is
                              why I feel so
                              much the way she disregards all I say. She does not realise that it is for her sake

                           <p id="d75437e8295">“You can't prevent it,” said Mrs. Gresley, her breath coming quickly. She was not
                              thinking of the
                              book at all, but of the writer. What was a book, one more or one less? It was her
                              duty to speak
                              the truth to her husband. His sister, whom he thought so much of, had no respect for
                              his
                              opinion, and he ought to know it. Mr. Gresley did know it, but he felt no particular
                              satisfaction in his wife's presentment of the fact.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8298">“It is no use saying I can't prevent it,” he said coldly, letting his arm fall by
                              his side. He
                              was no longer thinking of the book either, but of the disregard of his opinion, nay,
                              of his
                              authority which had long gravelled him in his sister's attitude towards him. “I shall
                              use my
                              authority when I see fit, and if I have so far used persuasion rather than authority,
                              it was
                              only because in my humble opinion it was the wisest course.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8301">“It has always failed,” said Mrs. Gresley, stung by the slackening of his arm. Yes.
                              In spite of
                              the new baby, she would rather have a hundred a year less than have this woman in
                              the house. The
                              wife ought to come first. By first, Mrs. Gresley meant without a second. She had this
                              morning
                              seen Emma laying Hester's clean clothes on her bed, just returned from a distant washerwoman
                              whom the Gresleys did not employ, and whom they had not wished Hester to employ. The
                              sight of
                              those two white dressing gowns beautifully “got up” with goffered frills, had aroused
                              afresh in
                              Mrs. Gresley, what she believed to be indignation at Hester's extravagance, an indignation
                              which
                              had been increased when she caught sight of her own untidy wrapper over her chair.
                              She always
                              appeared to disadvantage in Hester's presence. The old smouldering grievance about
                              the washing
                              set alight to other feelings. They caught. They burned. They had been drying in the
                              oven a long
                              time.

                           <p id="d75437e8304">“It has always failed,” said Mrs. Gresley, with subdued passion, “and it will fail
                              again. I heard
                              you tell Mrs. Loftus that you would never let Hester publish another book like the
                              ‘Idyll.’ But
                              though you say this one is worse, you won't be able to stop her. You will see when
                              she comes
                              back that she<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="267" data-tei-n="266"> </a></span> will pack up the parcel and send it back to the

                              the approach

                              Thursby majestically. “I have been lunching with the Pratts. They naturally wished
                              to hear the

                           <p id="d75437e8325">The Archdeacon was a friend of Mr. Gresley's. Mr. Gresley had not many friends among
                              the clergy,
                              possibly because he always attributed the popularity of any of his brethren to a laxity
                              of
                              principle on their part, or their success if they did succeed to the peculiarly easy
                              circumstances in which they were placed. But he greatly admired the Archdeacon, and
                              made no
                              secret of the fact, that in his opinion, he ought to have been the Bishop of the diocese.

                           <p id="d75437e8328">A long conversation now ensued on clerical matters, and Mr. Gresley's drooping spirits
                              revived
                              under a refreshing 
                              <foreign id="d75437e8330" xml:lang="fre">douche</foreign> of compliments on “Modern

                           <p id="d75437e8335">The idea flashed across his mind of asking the Archdeacon's advice regarding Hester's
                              book. His
                              opinion carried weight. His remarks on “Modern Dissent” showed how clear, how statesmanlike
                              his
                              judgment was. Mr. Gresley decided to lay the matter before him, and to consult him
                              as to his
                              responsibility in the matter. The Archdeacon did not know Hester. He did not know—for
                              he lived
                              at a distance of several miles—that Mr. Gresley had a sister who had written a book.

                              for we all keep our domestic skeletons in their cupboards, so he placed a hypothetical

                              before his friend.

                              had
                              written a most unwise letter, and this letter, by no fault of Mr. Gresley's, had fallen
                              into his
                              hands and been read by him. What was he, Mr. Gresley, to do? The letter, if posted,
                              would
                              certainly get the writer into trouble, and would cause acute humiliation to the writer's
                              family.
                              What would the Archdeacon do, in his place?

                           <p id="d75437e8346">Mr. Gresley did not perceive that the hypothetical case was not “on all fours” with
                              the real one.
                              His first impulse had been to gain the opinion of an expert without disclosing family
                              dissensions. Did some unconscious secondary motive impel him to shape the case so
                              that only one
                              verdict was probable?

                              her work.
                              Hester would never forgive her brother if he did that. It would certainly cause a

                              by his study window. If his prayers took the same bias as his recent statements to
                              his friend,
                              was that his fault? If he silenced as a sign of cowardice a voice within him which
                              entreated for
                              delay, was that his fault? If he had never educated himself to see any connection
                              between a seed
                              and a plant, a cause and a result, was that his fault? The first seedling impulse
                              to destroy the
                              book was buried and forgotten. If he mistook this towering, full-grown determination
                              which had
                              sprung from it for the will of God, the direct answer to prayer, was that his fault?

                              perhaps hardly realised till he was gone how much his loyal friendship had been to
                              her. Yet she
                              had hardly seen him for the last year, partly because she was absorbed in her book,
                              and partly
                              because, to her astonishment, she found that her brother and his wife looked coldly
                              upon “an
                              unmarried woman receiving calls from a married man.”

                              her in, “I have realised that I am unmarried. I never thought of it all the years
                              I lived in
                              London, but when I visit among the country people here, as I drive through the park,
                              I remember
                              with a qualm that I am a spinster, no doubt because I can't help it. As I enter the
                              hall I
                              recall with a pang that I am eight and twenty. By the time I am in the drawing-room
                              I am an old
                              maid.”

                              he died she
                              reproached herself for having temporarily laid it aside. Perhaps no one, except Lord
                              Newhaven's
                              brothers, felt his death more than Dick and Hester<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="272" data-tei-n="271"> </a></span> and the
                              Bishop. The Bishop had sincerely liked Lord Newhaven. A certain degree of friendship
                              had existed
                              between the two men, which had often trembled on the verge of intimacy. But the verge
                              had never
                              been crossed. It was the younger man who always drew back. The Bishop, with the instinct
                              of the
                              true priest, had an unshaken belief in his cynical neighbour. Lord Newhaven, who trusted
                              no one,
                              trusted the Bishop. They might have been friends. But there was a deeper reason for
                              grief at his
                              death than any sense of personal loss. The Bishop was secretly convinced that he had
                              died by his
                              own hand.

                           <p id="d75437e8494">Lord Newhaven had come to see him, the night he left Westhope, on his way to the station.
                              He had
                              only stayed a few minutes, and had asked him to do him a trifling service. The older
                              man had
                              agreed, had seen a momentary hesitation as Lord Newhaven turned to leave the room,
                              and had
                              forgotten the incident immediately in the press of continuous business. But with the
                              news of his
                              death the remembrance of that momentary interview returned, and with it the instant
                              conviction
                              that that accidental death had been carefully planned.

                              calmness to her glance. She had experienced the rest—better than sleep—of being understood,
                              of
                              being able to say what she thought without fear of giving offence. The Bishop's hospitality
                              had
                              been extended to her mind, instead of stopping short at the

                              been there a whole year. If the project had failed, as he seemed to think it had,
                              at any rate it
                              had been given a fair trial. Both sides had done<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="273" data-tei-n="272"> </a></span> their best.
                              She might ease money matters later for her brother by laying by part of the proceeds
                              of this
                              book for Regie's schooling. She could see that the Bishop thought highly of the book.
                              He had
                              read it before it was sent to the publisher. While she was at the Palace he had asked
                              her to

                              and others of his mental calibre, and she had complied at once, and had sent for the
                              book. No
                              doubt she should find it at Warpington on her return.

                              give her anything? The book itself was hers. Was it not dedicated to her? And she
                              would make her
                              home with Rachel for the present, as the Bishop advised, as Rachel had so urgently
                              begged her to

                              will go to Madeira or one of those warm places where one can sit like a cat in the
                              sun, and do
                              nothing, nothing, nothing, from morning till night. I used to be so afraid of going
                              back to
                              Warpington, but now that the time is coming to an end I am sure I shall not irritate
                              them so
                              much. And Minna will be glad. One can always manage if it is only for a fixed time.
                              And they
                              shall not be the losers by my leaving them. I will put by the money for my little

                              feel parting with him.”

                           <p id="d75437e8524">The sun was setting as she reached Warpington. All was grey, the church tower, the
                              trees, the
                              pointed gables of the Vicarage, set small together as in a Christmas card, against
                              the still red
                              sky. It only needed “Peace and Good Will” and a robin in the foreground to be complete.
                              The
                              stream was the only thing that moved, with its shimmering mesh of fire-tipt ripples
                              fleeing into
                              the darkness of the reeds. The little bridge,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="274" data-tei-n="273"> </a></span> so vulgar in
                              everyday life, leaned a mystery of darkness over a mystery of light. The white frost
                              held the
                              meadows, and binding them to the grey house and church and bare trees was a thin floating
                              ribbon
                              of—was it mist or smoke? In her own window a faint light wavered. They had lit a fire
                              in her
                              room. Hester's heart warmed to her sister-in-law at that little token of care and
                              welcome. Minna
                              should have all her flowers, except one small bunch for

                              she was ringing the bell, and Emma's smiling red face appeared behind the glass door.

                           <p id="d75437e8532">Hester ran past her into the drawing-room. Mrs. Gresley was sitting near the fire
                              with the old
                              baby beside her. She returned Hester's kiss somewhat nervously. She looked a little
                              frightened.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e8535">The old baby, luxuriously seated in his own little armchair, rose, and holding it
                              firmly against
                              his small person to prevent any disconnection with it, solemnly crossed the hearthrug,
                              and
                              placed the chair with himself in it by Hester.

                              about ‘The Idyll,’ only worse. That it is coarse and profane and exaggerated, and
                              that I have
                              put in improprieties in order to make it sell, and that I run down the clergy, and
                              that the book
                              ought never to be published. Dear James, spare me. You and I shall never agree on
                              certain
                              subjects. Let us be content to differ.”

                           <p id="d75437e8660">Mr. Gresley was disconcerted. Your antagonist has no business to discount all you

                              and that was
                              saying a good deal.

                              He hardly ever
                              lowered his voice.

                              responsibility in the matter. If I am blamed,” she smiled proudly—at that instant
                              she knew all
                              that her book was worth—“the blame will not attach to you. And, after all, Minna and

                              and the Thursbys need not read it.”

                              was only just
                              enough—“because, for your own sake, and for the sake of the innocent minds which might

                              into
                              him.

                              walked solemnly in, holding with extreme care a small tin plate, on which reposed
                              a large

                              from her. He fell shrieking. She rushed past him out of the room, and out of the house,
                              his
                              screams following her. “I've killed him,” she said.

                              knees beside the dead fire, and thrust apart the hot embers with her bare hands.

                              plainly visible as they fell to dust at the touch of her hands.

                              knelt down.

                              The night was
                              very still. The pen travelled, travelled. The fire had burnt down to a red glow. Presently
                              he
                              got up, walked to the window, and drew aside the curtain.

                              holding him convulsively by the knees.

                           <p id="d75437e8800">“I am not really anxious,” he said again, sitting down at the breakfast table. But
                              his face
                              contradicted him. It was blue and pinched, for he had just returned from reading the
                              morning
                              service to himself in an ice-cold church, but there was a pucker in the brow that
                              was not the
                              result of cold. The Vicarage porch had fallen down in the night, but he was evidently
                              not
                              thinking of that. He drank a little coffee and then got up and walked to the window
                              again.

                           <p id="d75437e8804">“She is with the Pratts,” he said with decision. “I am glad I sent a note over early,
                              if it will
                              relieve your mind, but I am convinced she is with the Pratts.”

                           <p id="d75437e8807">Mrs. Gresley murmured something. She looked scared. She made an attempt to eat something,
                              but it
                              was a mere pretence.

                              face was drawn with anxiety. In both hands she clutched a trailing skirt plaistered

                              hitched above a pair of large goloshed feet, into which the legs were grafted without

                              flowers beside them. They had been so beautiful yesterday when he gave them to Hester.

                              quite away on the word relief for want of wind.

                              is a delicate child, and she, Hester—may God forgive her—struck him in one of her
                              passions. She
                              might have killed him. And the poor child fell and bruised his arm and shoulder. And
                              he was
                              bringing her a little present when she did it. The child had done nothing whatever
                              to annoy her,

                           <p id="d75437e8958">Mr. Gresley smiled. “I am afraid, my lord, Hester has given you an inaccurate account.

                              swallowing something unpalatable. “In moments of great excitement nervous persons
                              like your
                              sister are capable of almost anything. The question is, whether she will survive the

                              drove her out of your house last night. Her hands are severely burnt. Dr. Brown, whom

                              “I am sorry if Hester is ill. I will,” and Mrs. Gresley made a superhuman effort,
                              “I will come

                              short.

                              by the
                              fireless hearth. The drawing-room fire was never lit till two o'clock.

                              of the window. “Drive faster,” he said.

                              explained
                              that he could spend a shilling, because he was always given sixpence by his father

                              pulled a tooth out. “And I've one loose now,” he said. “When I suck it it moves. It

                              begged Regie, who was dividing them equally, as a personal favour to eat them all.

                              Pratts had called, and Mr. Gresley, who departed early in the afternoon for Southminster,
                              had
                              left his wife no directions as to how to act in this unforeseen occurrence, or how
                              to parry the
                              questions with which she was overwhelmed.

                           <p id="d75437e9318">After long hesitation she at last owned that Hester had returned to Southminster in
                              the Bishop's
                              carriage not more than half an hour after it had brought her back.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9321">“I can't explain Hester's actions,” she would only repeat over and over again. “I
                              don't pretend
                              to understand clever people. I'm not clever myself. I can only say Hester went back
                              to
                              Southminster directly she arrived here.”

                           <p id="d75437e9324">Hardly had the Pratts taken their departure when Doll Loftus was ushered in. His wife
                              had sent
                              him to ask where Hester was, as 
                              <sic id="d75437e9326">Fraülein</sic> had alarmed her earlier in the day. Doll at
                              least asked no questions. He had never asked but one in his life, and that had been
                              of his wife,
                              five seconds before he had become engaged to her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9330">He accepted with equanimity the information that Hester had returned to Southminster,
                              and
                              departed to impart the same to his exasperated wife.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9333">“But why did she go back? She had only that moment arrived,” inquired Sybell. How
                              should Doll
                              know. She,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="291" data-tei-n="290"> </a></span> Sybell, had said she could not rest till she knew
                              where Hester was, and he, Doll, had walked to Warpington through the snow-drifts to
                              find out for
                              her. And he had found out, and now she wanted to know something else. There was no
                              satisfying
                              some women. And the injured husband retired to unlace his boots.

                           <p id="d75437e9338">Yes, Mrs. Gresley had passed an uncomfortable day. She had ventured out for a few
                              minutes, and
                              had found Abel, with his arms akimbo, contemplating the little gate which led to the
                              stables. It
                              was lying on the ground. He had swept the snow off it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9342">“I locked it up the same as usual last night,” he said to Mrs. Gresley. “There's been
                              somebody
                              about as has tampered it off its hinges. Yet nothing hasn't been touched, the coal
                              nor the
                              stack. It don't seem natural, twisting the gate off for nothing.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9345">Mrs. Gresley did not answer. She did not associate Hester with the gate. But she was
                              too much
                              perturbed to care about such small matters at the moment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9348">“His lordship's coachman tell me as Miss Gresley was at the Palace,” continued Abel,
                              “while I was
                              a hotting up his mash for him, for William had gone in with a note, and onst he's
                              in the kitchen
                              the hanimals might be stocks and stones for what he cares. He said his nevvy, the
                              footman, heard
                              the front door-bell ring just as he was getting into bed last night, and Miss Gresley
                              come in
                              without her hat, with the snow upon her. The coachman said as she must ha' run afoot
                              all the
                              way.”

                           <p id="d75437e9351">Abel looked anxiously at Mrs. Gresley.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9354">“I was just thinking,” he said, “as perhaps the little lady wasn't quite right in
                              her 'ead. They
                              do say as too much learning flies to the 'ead, the same as spirits to them as ain't

                              'em. And the little lady does work desperate hard.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9357">“Not as hard as Mr. Gresley,” said Mrs. Gresley.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9361">“Maybe not, Mem, maybe not. But when I come up when red cow was sick at four in the

                              shadder of her face agin the blind. Yes, she do work precious hard.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9366">Mrs. Gresley retreated into the house, picking her way over the 
                              <foreign id="d75437e9368" xml:lang="fre">débris</foreign> of the porch. At any other time its demise would have occupied the minds
                              of the Vicarage household for days. But until this moment it had hardly claimed the
                              tribute of a
                              sigh. Mrs. Gresley did sigh as she crossed the threshold. That prostrate porch meant
                              expense.
                              She had understood from her husband that Dick had wantonly torn out the clamp that
                              supported it,
                              and that the whole thing had in consequence given way under the first snowfall. “He
                              meant no
                              harm,” Mr. Gresley had added, “But I suppose in the Colonies they mistake horseplay
                              for
                              wit.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9372">Mrs. Gresley went back to the drawing-room, and sat down to her needlework. She was
                              an exquisite
                              needlewoman, but all the activity of her untiring hands was hardly able to stem the
                              tide of
                              mending that was for ever flowing in upon her. When was she to find time to finish
                              the darling
                              little garments which the new baby required? 
                              <sic id="d75437e9374">Fraülein</sic> had been kind in helping, but
                              
                              <sic id="d75437e9377">Fraülein</sic>'s eyes were not very strong, or her stitches in consequence very small.
                              Mrs. Gresley would have liked to sit in the schoolroom when lessons were over, but
                              
                              <sic id="d75437e9380">Fraülein</sic> had been so distant at luncheon about a rissole that she had not the
                              courage to go in.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9384">So she sat and stitched with a heavy heart awaiting her husband's return. The fly
                              was another
                              expense. Southminster was ten miles from Warpington, eleven according to the Loftus
                              Arms, from
                              which it issued, the owner of which was not on happy terms with his “teetotal” vicar.
                              Yet it had
                              been absolutely necessary to have the fly, in order that Regie, who so easily caught
                              cold, might
                              return in safety.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9387">The dusk was already falling, and more snow with it.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9390">It was quite dark when Mrs. Gresley at last caught the sound of wheels and hurried

                              and then went out to have<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="293" data-tei-n="292"> </a></span> an altercation with the driver, who
                              demurred in forcible language to the arrangement, adhered to by Mr. Gresley, that

                              the fly should be considered as part payment of certain arrears of tithe which in

                              was the unhappy duty of the clergyman to collect himself. Mr. Gresley's methods of
                              dealing with
                              money matters generally brought in a high rate of interest in the way of friction,
                              and it was a
                              long time before the driver drove away, turning his horse deliberately on the little
                              patch of
                              lawn under the dining-room windows.

                           <p id="d75437e9399">Regie in the meanwhile had waked up, and was having tea in the drawing-room as a great
                              treat.

                              was wanting
                              to give me the halfcrown, and he kept it downstairs. And when I went in again she
                              was in bed,
                              and she was so sleepy she hardly said anything at all.”

                           <p id="d75437e9415">Mrs. Gresley gave him his tea, and presently took Regie upstairs. Then she came back
                              and sat down
                              in a low chair close to her husband. It was the first drop of comfort in Mr. Gresley's
                              cup

                              “But they
                              would not let me see her.”

                              And the
                              Bishop backed him up. They said it would excite her.”

                              better this
                              evening. They seemed to think a great deal of her knowing Regie.”

                              They have got a nurse, and they have telegraphed for Miss West. The Bishop was very
                              good to
                              Regie and gave him that fur rug.”

                           <p id="d75437e9448">“I am afraid,” said Mrs. Gresley after a pause, “that Hester did run all the way to
                              Southminster
                              as the Bishop said. Abel said the Bishop's coachman told him that she came late last
                              night to
                              the Palace, and she was white with snow when the footman let her in.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9452">“My dear, I should have thought you were too sensible to listen to servant's gossip,”
                              said Mr.
                              Gresley impatiently. “Your own common sense will tell you that Hester never performed
                              that
                              journey on foot. I told Dr. Brown the same, but he lost his temper at once. It's curious
                              how
                              patient he is in a sick room, and how furious he can be out of it. He was very angry
                              with me,
                              too, because when he mentioned to the Bishop in my presence that Hester was under
                              morphia, I
                              said I strongly objected to her being drugged, and when I repeated that morphia was
                              a most
                              dangerous drug with effects worse than intoxication, in fact, that morphia was a form
                              of
                              intoxication, he positively before the Bishop shook his fist in my face, and said
                              he was not
                              going to be taught his business by me.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9455">“The Bishop took me away into the study. Dick Vernon was sitting there, at least he
                              was creeping
                              about on all fours with Regie on his back. I think he must be in love with Hester,
                              he asked so
                              anxiously if there was any change. He would not speak to me, pretended not to know
                              me. I suppose
                              the Bishop had told him about the porch, and he was afraid I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="295" data-tei-n="294"> </a></span>
                              should come on him for repairs as he had tampered with it. The Bishop sent them away,
                              and said
                              he wanted to have a talk with me. The Bishop himself was the only person who was kind.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9460">There was a long pause. Mrs. Gresley laid her soft cheek against her husband's, and
                              put her small
                              hand in a protecting manner over his large one. It was not surprising that on the
                              following
                              Sunday Mr. Gresley said such beautiful things about women being pillows against which
                              weary
                              masculine athletes could rest.

                           <p id="d75437e9463">“He spoke very nicely of you,” went on Mr. Gresley at last. “He said he appreciated
                              your goodness
                              in letting Regie go after what had happened, and your offer to come and nurse Hester
                              yourself.
                              And then he spoke about 
                              <emph id="d75437e9465">me</emph>. And he said he knew well how devoted I was to my work,
                              and how anything I did for the Church was a real labour of love, and that my heart
                              was in my
                              work.”

                           <p id="d75437e9469">“It is quite true. So it is,” said Mrs. Gresley.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9472">“I never thought he understood me so well. And he went on to say that he knew I must
                              be
                              dreadfully anxious about my sister, but that as far as money was concerned—I had offered
                              to pay
                              for a nurse—I was to put all anxiety off my mind. He would take all responsibility
                              about the
                              illness. He said he had a little fund laid by for emergencies of this kind, and that
                              he could
                              not spend it better than on Hester whom he loved like his own child. And then he went
                              on to
                              speak of Hester. I don't remember all he said when he turned off about her, but he
                              spoke of her
                              as if she were a person quite out of the common.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9476">“He always did spoil her,” said Mrs. Gresley.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9479">“He went off on a long rigmarole about her and her talent, and how vain he and I should
                              be if
                              leading articles appeared in the 
                              <title id="d75437e9481">Spectator</title> about us as they did about her. I did
                              not know there had been anything of the kind, but he said every one else did. And
                              then he went
                              on more slowly that Hester was under a foolish hallucination, as groundless, no doubt,
                              as<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="296" data-tei-n="295"> </a></span> that she had caused Regie's death, that her book was
                              destroyed. He said, ‘It is this idea which has got firm hold of her, but which has
                              momentarily
                              passed off her mind in her anxiety about Regie, which has caused her illness.’ And
                              then he
                              looked at me. He seemed really quite shaky. He held on to a chair. I think his health
                              is
                              breaking.”

                           <p id="d75437e9487">“And what did you say?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9490">“I said the truth, that it was no hallucination but the fact, that much as I regretted
                              to say so
                              Hester had written a profane and immoral book, and that I had felt it my duty to burn
                              it, and a
                              very painful duty it had been. I said he would have done the same if he had read it.”

                           <p id="d75437e9496">“Well, the awkward part was that he said he had read it, every word, and that he considered
                              it
                              the finest book that had been written in his day. And then he began to walk up and
                              down and to
                              become rather excited, and to say that he could not understand how I could take upon
                              myself such
                              a responsibility, or on what grounds I considered myself a judge of literature. As
                              if I ever did
                              consider myself a judge! But I do know right from wrong. We had got on all right up
                              till then,
                              especially when he spoke so cordially of you and me, but directly he made a personal
                              matter of
                              Hester's book, setting his opinion against mine, for he repeated over and over again
                              it was a
                              magnificent book, his manner seemed to change. He tried to speak kindly, but all the
                              time I saw
                              that my considering the book bad while he thought it good, gravelled him, and made

                              annoyed with me. The truth is, he can't bear any one to think differently from himself.”

                           <p id="d75437e9503">“I said I supposed he thought it right to run down the clergy and hold them up to
                              ridicule. He
                              said ‘Certainly not, but he did not see how that applied to anything in Hester's book.’
                              He said,
                              ‘She has drawn us without bias towards us, exactly as we appear to three-quarters
                              of the laity.
                              It won't do us any harm to see ourselves for once as others see<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="297" data-tei-n="296"> </a></span> us. There is in these days an increasing adverse criticism of us in many men's minds,
                              to
                              which your sister's mild rebukes are as nothing. We have drawn it upon ourselves,
                              not so much by
                              our conduct, which I believe to be uniformly above reproach, or by any lack of zeal,
                              as by our
                              ignorance of our calling; by our inability to “convert life into truth,” the capital
                              secret of
                              our profession, as I was once told as a divinity student. I for one believe that the
                              Church will
                              regain her prestige and her hold on the heart of the nation, but if she does, it will
                              be mainly
                              due to a new element in the minds of the clergy, a stronger realisation, not of our
                              responsibilities—we have that—but of the education, the personal search for truth,
                              the knowledge
                              of human nature, which are necessary to enable us to meet them.’ He went on a long
                              time about
                              that. I think he grows very wordy. But I did not argue with him. I let him say what
                              he liked. I
                              knew that I must be obedient to my Bishop, just as I should expect my clergy to be
                              to me, if I
                              ever am a Bishop myself. Not that I expect I ever shall be”—Mr. Gresley was over tired—“but
                              it
                              seemed to me as he talked about the book, that all the time, though he put me down
                              to the
                              highest motives—he did me that justice—he was trying to make me own I had done wrong.”

                              Thursby on the
                              matter, and he had strongly advised me to do as I did. The Bishop seemed thunderstruck.
                              And
                              then—it really seemed providential—who should come in but Archdeacon Thursby himself.
                              The Bishop
                              went straight up to him, and said ‘You come at a fortunate moment, for I am greatly
                              distressed
                              at the burning of Miss Gresley's book, and Gresley tells me that you advised it.’
                              And would you
                              believe it,” said Mr. Gresley in a strangled voice, “the Archdeacon actually denied
                              it then and
                              there. He said he did not know Hester had written a book, and had never been consulted
                              on the
                              subject.”

                              exhausted and overwrought. He sobbed against his wife's shoulder.

                              I never
                              thought the Archdeacon could have behaved like that!”

                              Bishop. And
                              when I expostulated with him, and reminded him of what he had advised only the day
                              before, he
                              said that was about a letter, not a book, as if it mattered which it was. It was the
                              principle
                              that mattered. But they neither of them would listen to me. I said I had offered to
                              help to
                              re-write it, and the Bishop became quite fierce. He said I might as well try to re-write
                              Regie
                              if he were in his coffin. And then he mentioned casually, as if it were quite an afterthought,
                              that Hester had sold it for a thousand pounds. All through, I knew he was really trying
                              to hurt
                              my feelings in spite of his manner, but when he said 
                              <emph id="d75437e9525">that</emph> he succeeded.”

                           <p id="d75437e9532">“A thousand pounds!” said Mrs. Gresley, turning white. “Oh! It isn't possible.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9535">“He said he had seen the publisher's letter offering it, and that Hester had accepted
                              it by his
                              advice. He seemed to know all about her affairs. When he said that, I was so distressed
                              I could
                              not help showing it, and he made rather light of it, saying the money loss was the
                              least serious
                              part of the whole affair, but of course it is the worst. Poor Hester, when I think
                              that owing to
                              me she has lost a thousand pounds! Seventy pounds a year, if I had invested it for
                              her, and I
                              know of several good investments, all perfectly safe, at seven per cent.—when I think
                              of it it
                              makes me absolutely miserable. We won't talk of it any more. The Bishop sat with his
                              head in his
                              hands for a long time after the Archdeacon had gone, and afterwards he was quite kindly
                              again,
                              and said we looked at the subject from such different points of view that perhaps
                              there was no
                              use in discussing it. And we talked<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="299" data-tei-n="298"> </a></span> of the Church Congress
                              until the fly came, only he seemed dreadfully tired, quite knocked up. And he promised
                              to let us
                              know first thing to-morrow morning how Hester was. He was cordial when we left. I
                              think he meant
                              well. But I can never feel the same to Archdeacon Thursby again. He was quite my greatest
                              friend
                              among the clergy round here. I suppose I shall learn in time not to have such a high
                              ideal of
                              people, but I certainly thought very highly of him until to-day.”

                              we look for in our fellow creatures, but for what is apparently rarer, a little plain

                              have loudly disclaimed such an opinion if it had been attributed to him; but nevertheless
                              it was
                              the key-note of his behaviour towards them, his belief concerning them which was of

                              telling me, I suddenly trusted you entirely. I had not quite up till then. I can't

                              were open with me. I think, Hugh, you and I can dare to be truthful to each other.

                              so to me, and I will be so to you. I knew about

                              Newhaven, poor thing, confided in me last summer. She had to tell some one. I think
                              you ought to
                              know that I know. And oh, Hugh, I knew about the drawing of lots, too.”

                              little distance
                              from her, he might have told her the truth. He owed it to her, this woman who was
                              the very soul
                              of truth. But if she had withdrawn from him, however gently, in the moment when her
                              tenderness
                              had for the first time vanquished her natural reserve, if she had taken herself away
                              then, he
                              could not have borne it. In deep repentance after Lord Newhaven's death, he had vowed
                              that from
                              that day forward he would never deviate again from the path of truth and honour, however
                              difficult it might prove. But this frightful moment had come upon him unawares. He
                              drew back
                              instinctively, giddy and unnerved, as from a chasm yawning suddenly among the flowers,
                              one step
                              in front of him. He was too stunned to think. When he rallied they were standing together
                              on the
                              hearthrug, and she was saying—he did not know what she was saying, for he was repeating
                              over and
                              over again to himself, “The moment is past. The moment is past.”

                           <p id="d75437e9801">At last her words conveyed some meaning to him. “We will never speak of this again,
                              my friend,”
                              she said; “but now that no harm can be done by it, it seemed right to tell you I knew.”

                              had to
                              abide by it.”

                              If it recoiled upon himself you were not to blame. You have done wrong, and you have
                              repented.
                              You have suffered, Hugh. I know it by your face. And perhaps I have suffered, too,

                           <p id="d75437e9859">His escape had been too narrow. He shivered at the mere thought of it. It had never
                              struck him as
                              possible that Rachel and Lady Newhaven had known of the drawing of lots. Now that
                              he found they
                              knew, sundry small incidents, unnoticed at the time, came crowding back to his memory.
                              That was
                              why Lady Newhaven had written so continually those letters which he had burnt unread.
                              That was
                              why she had made that desperate attempt to see him in the smoking-room at Wilderleigh
                              after the
                              boating accident. She wanted to know which had drawn the short lighter. That explained
                              the
                              mysterious tension which Hugh had noticed in Rachel during the last days in London

                              the time was up. He saw it all now. And, of course, they naturally supposed that Lord
                              Newhaven
                              had committed suicide. They could not think otherwise. They were waiting for one of
                              the two men
                              to do it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9863">“If Lord Newhaven had not turned giddy and stumbled on to the line, if he had not

                              believed he had died by his own hand. Hugh as firmly believed that the death was accidental.

                           <p id="d75437e9880">By an extraordinary, by a miraculous chance, he was saved, as it were, a second time.
                              It could do
                              no good to allude to the dreadful subject again. Besides, he had promised Rachel never
                              to speak
                              of it again.

                           <p id="d75437e9884">He groaned, and hid his face in his hands.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9887">“Oh, coward and wretch that I am,” he said. “Cannot I even be honest with myself?
                              I lied to her
                              to-day. I never thought I could have told Rachel a lie, but I did. I can't live without
                              her. I
                              must have her. I would rather die than lose her now. And I should have lost her if
                              I'd told her
                              the truth. I felt that. I am not worthy. It was an ill day for her when she took my
                              tarnished
                              life into her white hands. She ought to have trodden me under foot. But she does love
                              me, and I
                              will never deceive her again. She does love me, and, God helping me, I will make her
                              happy.”

                           <p id="d75437e9890">The strain of conflict was upon Hugh—the old, old conflict of the seed with the earth,
                              of the
                              soul with love. How many little fibres and roots the seed puts out, pushed by an unrecognised
                              need within itself, not without pain, not without a gradual rending of its being,
                              not without a
                              death unto self into a higher life. Love was dealing with Hugh's soul as the earth
                              deals with
                              the seed, and—he suffered.

                           <p id="d75437e9893">It was a man who did not look like an accepted lover who presented himself at Rachel's
                              door the
                              following afternoon.

                           <p id="d75437e9896">But Rachel was not there. Her secretary handed Hugh a little note which she had left
                              for him,
                              telling him that Hester had suddenly fallen ill, and that she had been sent for to
                              Southminster.
                              The note ended: “These first quiet days are past. So now you may tell your mother,
                              and put our
                              engagement in the

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9902">Hugh was astonished at the despair which overwhelmed him at the bare thought that
                              he should not
                              see Rachel that day and not the next either. It was not to be borne. She had no right
                              to make
                              him suffer like this. Day by day, when a certain restless fever returned upon him,
                              he had known,
                              as an opium eater knows, that at a certain hour he should<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="310" data-tei-n="309"> </a></span>
                              become rested and calm and sane once more. To be in the same room with Rachel, to
                              hear her
                              voice, to let his eyes dwell upon her, to lean his forehead for a moment against her
                              hand, was
                              to enter, as we enter in dreams, a world of joy and comfort, and boundless, endless,
                              all-pervading peace.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9908">And now he was suddenly left shivering in a bleak world without her. With her he was
                              himself, a
                              released, freed self, growing daily further and further away from all he had once
                              been. Without
                              her he felt he was nothing but a fierce wounded animal.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9911">He tried to laugh at himself as he walked slowly away from Rachel's house. He told
                              himself that
                              he was absurd, that an absence of a few days was nothing. He turned his steps mechanically
                              in
                              the direction of his mother's lodgings. At any rate, he could tell her. He could talk
                              about this
                              cruel woman to her. The smart was momentarily soothed by his mother's painful joy.
                              He wrenched
                              himself somewhat out of himself as she wept the tears of jealous love which all mothers
                              must
                              weep when the woman comes who takes their son away.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9914">“I am so glad,” she kept repeating. “These are tears of joy, Hughie. I can forgive
                              her for
                              accepting you, but I should never have forgiven her if she had refused you—if she
                              had made my
                              boy miserable. And you have been miserable lately I have seen it for a long time.
                              I suppose it
                              was all this coming on.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9917">He said it was. The remembrance of other causes of irritation and moodiness had slipped
                              entirely
                              off his mind.

                           <p id="d75437e9920">He stayed a long time with his mother, who pressed him to wait till his sister, who
                              was shopping,
                              returned. But his sister tarried long out of doors, and at last the pain of Rachel's
                              absence
                              returning on him, he left suddenly, promising to return in the evening.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9923">He did not go back to his rooms. He wandered aimlessly through the darkening streets,
                              impatient
                              of the slow hours. At last he came out on the Embankment. The sun was setting redly,
                              frostily,
                              in a grey world of sky-mist and river-mist and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="311" data-tei-n="310"> </a></span> spectral bridge
                              and spire. A shaking pathway of pale flame came across the grey of the hidden river
                              to meet
                              him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9929">He stood a long time looking at it. The low sun touched and forsook, touched and forsook
                              point by
                              point the little crowded world which it was leaving.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9932">“My poor mother,” said Hugh to himself. “Poor, gentle, loving soul whom I so nearly
                              brought down
                              with sorrow to the grave. She will never know what an escape she has had. I might
                              have been more
                              to her. I might have made her happier, seeing her happiness is wrapped up in me. I
                              will make up
                              to her for it. I will be a better son to her in future. Rachel and I together will
                              make her last
                              years happy. Rachel and I together,” said Hugh over and over again.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9935">And then he suddenly remembered that though Rachel had taken herself away he could
                              write to her,
                              and—he might look out the trains to Southminster. He leaped into a hansom and hurried
                              back to
                              his rooms.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9938">The porter met him in a mysterious manner in the entrance. Lady waiting to see him.
                              Lady said she
                              was his sister. Had been waiting two hours. In his rooms now.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9941">Hugh laughed and ran up the wide common staircase. His sister had heard the news from
                              his mother
                              and had rushed over at once.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9944">As he stooped a little to fit the latch-key on his chain into the lock a man, who
                              was coming down
                              the stairs feeling in his pockets, stopped with a sudden exclamation. It was Captain
                              Pratt,
                              pallid, smiling, hair newly varnished, resplendent in a magnificent fur overcoat.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9948">“What luck,” he said. “Scarlett, I think. We met at Wilderleigh. Have you such a thing
                              as a match
                              about you?”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9951">Hugh felt in his pockets. He had not one.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9954">“Never mind,” he said, opening the door. “I've plenty inside. Come in.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9957">Hugh went in first, extricating his key. Captain Pratt followed, murmuring “Nice little
                              dens,
                              these. A pal of mine<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="312" data-tei-n="311"> </a></span> lives just above—Streatham. You know

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9962">The remainder of the sentence was lost.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e9965">The door opened straight into the little sitting-room. A woman in deep mourning rose
                              suddenly out
                              of a chair by the fire and came towards them.

                           <p id="d75437e9975">It is probable that none of the tableaux she had arranged were quite so dramatic as
                              this one, in
                              which she had not reckoned on that elaborate figure in the doorway.

                              estate, leapt from temperate to summer heat—blood heat. After the first instant he
                              kept his eyes
                              steadily fixed on Hugh.

                              by the

                              has shown you
                              into by mistake, not Mr. Streatham's, your nephew. He is just above. I think,” turning
                              to
                              Captain Pratt, “Streatham is out of town.”

                           <p id="d75437e9991">“He is out of town,” said Captain Pratt, looking with cold admiration at Hugh. “Admirable,”
                              he
                              said to himself; “a born gentleman.”

                           <p id="d75437e9994">“This is not the first time Streatham's visitors have been shown in here,” continued
                              Hugh. “The
                              porter shall be dismissed. I trust you will forgive me my share in the annoyance he
                              has caused
                              you. Is your carriage waiting?”

                           <p id="d75437e9997">“No,” said Lady Newhaven faintly, quite thrown off the lines of her prepared scene
                              by the sudden
                              intrusion into it of a foreign body.

                           <p id="d75437e10000">“My hansom is below,” said Captain Pratt deferentially, venturing, now that the situation
                              was, so
                              to speak, draped, to turn his discreet agate eyes towards Lady Newhaven. “If<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="313" data-tei-n="312"> </a></span> it could be of the least use, I myself should prefer to walk.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10005">Now that he looked at her he looked very hard at her. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10009">Lady Newhaven's self-possession had returned sufficiently for her to take up her fur
                              cloak.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10012">“Thank you,” she said, letting Captain Pratt help her on with it. “I shall be glad
                              to make use of
                              your hansom, if you are sure you can spare it. I am shocked at having taken possession
                              of your
                              rooms,” turning to Hugh; “I will write to Georgie Streatham to-night. I am staying
                              with my
                              mother, and I came across to ask him to take my boys to the pantomime, as I cannot
                              take them
                              myself—so soon,” with a glance at her crape. “Don't come down, Mr. Scarlett. I have
                              given you
                              enough trouble already.”

                           <p id="d75437e10015">Captain Pratt's arm was crooked. He conducted her in his best manner to the foot of
                              the staircase
                              and helped her into his hansom. His manner was not so unctuous as his father's, but
                              it was
                              slightly adhesive. Lady Newhaven shuddered involuntarily as she took his arm.

                           <p id="d75437e10021">“I hope you will both come and see my mother,” she said, with an attempt at graciousness.
                              “You
                              know Lady Trentham, I think?”—to Captain Pratt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10024">“Very slightly. No. Delighted!” murmured Captain Pratt, closing the hansom doors in
                              an intimate
                              manner. “And if I could be of the least use at any time in taking your boys to the
                              pantomime—er—only too glad. The glass down, Richards!”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10028">The hansom with its splendid bay horse rattled off.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10031">Captain Pratt nodded to Hugh, who was still standing on the steps, and turned away
                              to buy a box
                              of matches from a passing urchin. Then he turned up his fur collar, and proceeded
                              leisurely on
                              his way.

                           <p id="d75437e10034">“Very stand-off both of them in the past,” he said to himself, “but they will have
                              to be civil in
                              future. I wonder if<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="314" data-tei-n="313"> </a></span> he will make her keep her title. Deuced
                              awkward for them both though, only a month after Newhaven's death. I wish that sort

                              fellows suddenly. An opening like that is all I want to give me a start, and I should
                              get on as
                              well as anybody. The aristocracy all hang together, whatever Selina and Ada may say.

                           <p id="d75437e10042">Hugh went back to his room and locked himself in. He was a delicate man, highly strung,
                              and he
                              had not slept the night before. He collapsed into a chair and remained a long time,
                              his head in
                              his hands.

                           <p id="d75437e10045">It was too horrible, this woman coming back upon him suddenly like the ghost of some
                              one whom he
                              had murdered. His momentary infatuation had been clean forgotten in his overwhelming
                              love for
                              Rachel. His intrigue with Lady Newhaven seemed so long ago that it had been relegated
                              to the
                              same mental shelf in his mind as the nibbling of a certain forbidden ginger-bread
                              when he was
                              home for his first holidays. He could not be held responsible for either offence after
                              this
                              immense interval of time. It was not he who had committed them, but that other embryo
                              self, that
                              envelope of flesh and sense which he was beginning to abhor, through which he had
                              passed before
                              he reached himself, Hugh, the real man, the man who loved Rachel, and whom Rachel
                              loved.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10048">He had not flinched when he came unexpectedly on Lady Newhaven. At the sight of her
                              a sudden
                              passion of anger shot up and enveloped him as in one flame from head to foot. His
                              love for
                              Rachel was a weapon, and he used it. He did not greatly care about his own good name,
                              but the
                              good name of the man whom Rachel loved was a thing to fight for. It was for her sake,
                              not Lady
                              Newhaven's, that he had concocted the story of the mistaken rooms. He should not have
                              had the
                              presence of mind if Rachel had not been concerned.

                              yet with her, hideous scenes, in which the corpse of his dead lust would be dragged
                              up, a thing
                              to shudder at, out of its nettly grave.

                           <p id="d75437e10057">He could bear it. He must bear it. Nothing would induce him to marry Lady Newhaven,
                              as she
                              evidently expected. He set his teeth. “She will know the day after to-morrow,” he
                              said to
                              himself, “when she sees my engagement to Rachel in the papers. Then she will get at
                              me somehow,
                              and make my life a hell to me, while she can. And she will try and come between me
                              and Rachel. I
                              deserve it. I deserve anything I get. But Rachel knows and will stick to me. I will
                              go down to
                              her to-morrow. I can't go on without seeing her. And she won't mind, as the engagement
                              will be
                              given out next day.”

                           <p id="d75437e10060">He became more composed at the thought of Rachel. But presently his lip quivered.
                              It would be all
                              right in the end. But, oh! not to have done it! Not to have done it! To have come
                              to his
                              marriage with a whiter past, not to need her forgiveness on the very threshold of
                              their life
                              together, not to have been unfaithful to her before he knew her.

                              joined him and his sister and Rachel at luncheon at the Palace. “I am convinced that
                              you have
                              been up to some mischief.”

                           <p id="d75437e10096">“I have just returned from Warpington, my lord. I understood it was your wish I should
                              ride over
                              and tell them Hester was better.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10100">“It certainly was my wish. I'm very much obliged to you. But I remembered after you
                              had gone that
                              you had refused to speak to Gresley when he was over here, and I was sorry I sent

                           <p id="d75437e10103">“I spoke to him all right,” said Dick grimly. “That was why I was so alacritous to
                              go.”

                           <p id="d75437e10112">“Just so,” said Dick, helping himself to mustard. “But you see I'm his cousin, and
                              I thought it
                              just as well to let him know quietly and dispassionately what I thought of him. So
                              I told him I
                              was not particular about my acquaintances. I knew lots of bad eggs out in Australia,
                              half of
                              them hatched in England, chaps who'd been shaved and tubbed gratis by Government,
                              in fact I'd a
                              large visiting list, but that I drew the line at such a cad as him, and that he might
                              remember I
                              wasn't going to preach for him at any more of his little cold<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="317" data-tei-n="316"> </a></span>
                              water cures”—a smile hovered on Dick's crooked mouth—“or ever take any notice of him
                              in future.
                              That was what he wanted, my lord. You were too soft with him, if you'll excuse my
                              saying so. But
                              that sort of chap wants it giving him hot and strong. He doesn't understand anything
                              else. He
                              gets quite beyond himself, fizzing about on his little pocket-handkerchief of a parish,
                              thinking
                              he is a sort of god, because no one makes it their business to keep him in his place,
                              and rub it
                              into him that he is an infernal fool. That is why some clergymen jaw so, because they
                              never have
                              it brought home to them what rot they talk. They'd be no sillier than other men if
                              they were
                              only treated properly. I was very calm, but I let him have it. I told him he was a
                              mean sneak,
                              and that either he was the biggest fool or the biggest rogue going, and that the mere
                              fact of
                              his cloth did not give him the right to do dishonest things with other people's property,
                              though
                              it did save him from the pounding he richly deserved. He tried to interrupt, indeed
                              he was
                              tooting all the time like a fog-horn, but I did not take any notice, and I wound up
                              by saying it
                              was men like him who brought discredit on the Church and on the clergy, and who made
                              the gorge
                              rise of decent chaps like me.”

                           <p id="d75437e10117">“Yes,” said Dick after a pause. “When I left him he understood, I don't say entirely,
                              but he had
                              a distant glimmering. It isn't often I go on these errands of mercy, but I felt that
                              the least I
                              could do was to back you up, my lord. Of course, it is in little matters like this
                              that lay
                              helpers come in, who are not so hampered about their language as I suppose the clergy
                              are.”

                           <p id="d75437e10124">“Don't thank me,” said Dick. “Nothing is a trouble where you are concerned. It
                              was—ahem—pleasure.”

                           <p id="d75437e10127">“That I can believe,” said the Bishop. “Well, Dick, Providence makes use of strange
                              instruments—the jawbone of an ass has a certain Scriptural prestige. I daresay you
                              reached<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="318" data-tei-n="317"> </a></span> poor Gresley where I failed. I certainly failed. But if it is
                              not too much to ask, I should regard it as a favour another time if I might be informed
                              beforehand what direction your diocesan aid was about to take.”

                              hampered
                              throughout life by a predilection for the wrong name, and by making engagements in
                              illegible
                              handwriting by last year's almanacs.

                              the accident happened.”

                           <p id="d75437e10164">“That's the man. He got out at Southminster, and asked me which was the best hotel.

                              have any more, thanks. I'll go up and see Miss Gresley at once.”

                           <p id="d75437e10167">Rachel followed the Bishop into the library. They generally waited there together
                              till the doctor
                              came down.

                           <p id="d75437e10170">“I don't know many young men I like better than Dick,” said the Bishop. “I should
                              marry him if I
                              were a young<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="319" data-tei-n="318"> </a></span> woman. I admire the way he acts up to his
                              principles. Very few of us do. Until he has a further light on the subject he is right
                              to knock
                              a man down who insults him. And from his point of view he was justified in speaking
                              to Mr.
                              Gresley as he did. I was sorely tempted to say something of that kind to him myself,
                              but as one
                              grows grey one realises that one can only speak in a spirit of love. A man of Dick's
                              stamp will
                              always be respected because he does not assume virtues which belong to a higher grade
                              than he is
                              on at present. But when he reaches that higher grade he will act as thoroughly upon
                              the
                              convictions that accompany it as he does now on his present convictions.”

                           <p id="d75437e10178">“I should not advise the smiter to reckon on it. And unless it is turned from that
                              rare sense of
                              spiritual brotherhood it would be unmanly to turn it. To imitate the outward appearance
                              of
                              certain virtues is like imitating the clothes of a certain class. It does not make
                              us belong to
                              the class to dress like it. The true foundation for the spiritual life, as far as
                              I can see it,
                              is in the full development of our human nature with all its simple trusts and aspirations.
                              I
                              admire Dick's solid foundation. It will carry a building worthy of him some day. But

                              wisdom appear to be thrown away upon you. You are thinking of something else.”

                              back the power of loving. It almost frightens me that I can care so much a second
                              time. I should
                              not have thought it possible. But I seem to have got the hang of it now, as Mr. Dick
                              would say.
                              I wish you were downstairs, Hester, as you will be in a day or two. You would be amused
                              by the
                              way he shocks Miss Keane. She asked if he had written anything on his travels, and
                              he said he
                              was on the point of bringing out a little book on ‘Cannibal Cookery,’ for the use
                              of Colonials.
                              He said some of the recipes were very simple. He began: ‘You take a hand and close
                              it round a
                              yam.’ But the Bishop stopped him.”

                           <p id="d75437e10361">The moment Rachel had said, “He is on the point of bringing out a book,” her heart
                              stood still.
                              How could she have said such a thing? But apparently Hester took no notice.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10364">“He must have been experimenting on my poor hand,” she said. “I'm sure I never burnt
                              it like this
                              myself.”

                              says that is nonsense, but I think so all the same. When you believe a thing, and
                              you're told
                              it's nonsense, and you still believe it, that is an hallucination, isn't it?”

                           <p id="d75437e10383">“I have had a great many,” said Hester slowly. “I suppose I have been more ill than
                              I knew. I
                              thought I saw, I really did see, the spirits of the frost and the snow looking in
                              at the window.
                              And I talked to them a long time, and asked them what quarrel they had with me, their
                              sister,
                              that since I was a child they had always been going about to kill me. Aunt Susan always
                              seemed
                              to think they were enemies who gave me bronchitis. And I told them how I loved them
                              and all
                              their<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="324" data-tei-n="323"> </a></span> works. And they breathed on the pane and wrote
                              beautiful things in frost-work, and I read them all. Now, Rachel, is that an hallucination
                              about
                              the frost-work, because it seems to me still, now that I am better, though I can't
                              explain it,
                              that I do see the meaning of it at last, and that I shall never be afraid of them
                              again.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10388">Rachel did not answer.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10391">She had long since realised that Hester, when in her normal condition, saw things
                              which she
                              herself did not see. She had long since realised that Hester always accepted as final
                              the limit
                              of vision of the person she was with, but that that limit changed with every person
                              she met.
                              Rachel had seen her adjust it to persons more short-sighted than herself, with secret
                              self-satisfaction, and then with sudden bewilderment had heard Hester accept as a
                              commonplace
                              from some one else what appeared to Rachel fantastic in the extreme. If Rachel had
                              considered
                              her own mind as the measure of the normal of all other minds, she could not have escaped
                              the
                              conclusion that Hester was a victim of manifold delusions. But, fortunately for herself,
                              she saw
                              that most ladders possessed more than the one rung on which she was standing.

                           <p id="d75437e10394">“That is quite different, isn't it?” said Hester, “from thinking Dr. Brown is a grey
                              wolf.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10398">“Quite different. That was an hallucination of fever. You see that for yourself now
                              that you have
                              no fever.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10401">“I see that, of course, now that I have no fever,” repeated Hester, her eyes widening.
                              “But one
                              hallucination quite as foolish as that is always coming back, and I can't shake it
                              off. The wolf
                              was gone directly, but this is just the same now I am better, only it gets worse and
                              worse. I
                              have never spoken of it to any one, because I know it is so silly. But, Rachel—I have
                              no fever
                              now—and yet—I know you'll laugh at me—I laugh at my own foolish self—and yet all the
                              time I have
                              a horrible feeling that”—Hester's eyes had in them a terror that was hardly human—“that
                              my book
                              is burnt.”

                           <p id="d75437e10440">“She has done it to spite me,” said Mr. Tristram to himself over his morning rasher,
                              in the
                              little eating-house near his studio. “I knew there was some one else in her mind when
                              she
                              refused me. I rather thought it was that weedy fellow with the high nose. Will he
                              make her happy
                              because he is a lord's son? That is what I should like to ask her. Poor Rachel, if
                              we had been
                              able to marry five years ago we should never have heard of this society craze. Well,
                              it's all
                              over now.” And Mr. Tristram henceforward took the position of a man suffering from
                              an indelible
                              attachment to a woman who had thrown him over for a title.

                           <p id="d75437e10443">The Gresleys were astonished at the engagement. It was so extraordinary that they
                              should know
                              both persons. Now that they came to think of it, both of them had been to tea at the
                              Vicarage
                              only last summer.

                              boor, that underbred, foul-mouthed Dick Vernon wanted to marry her.”

                           <p id="d75437e10454">“Don't mention him,” said Mrs. Gresley. “When I think of what he dared to say—”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e10458">“My love,” said Mr. Gresley, “I have forgiven him. I have put from my mind all he
                              said, for I am
                              convinced he was under the influence of drink at the time. We must make allowance
                              for those who
                              live in hot climates. I bear him no grudge. But I am glad that a man of that stamp
                              should not
                              marry Miss West. Drunkenness makes a hell of married life. Mr. Scarlett, though he
                              looked
                              delicate, had at least the appearance of being abstemious.”

                              was greatly depressed. She could not be with her dear Miss Gresley in this mysterious
                              illness
                              which some secret sorrow had brought upon her; but at least Miss West could minister
                              to her. And
                              now it seemed Miss West was thinking of “

                              to one whom she considered her equal. The servants were allowed to disregard with
                              impunity her
                              small polite requests. The nurse was consistently, ferociously jealous of her. But
                              the children
                              had made up for all, and now she was leaving them; and she did not own it to herself,
                              for she
                              was but five and thirty and the shyest of the shy; but she should see no more that
                              noble-hearted, that musical Herr B-r-r-rown.

                              Pratt's head, any more than that of a ten-year-old child. He was aware that all the

                              upper classes were immoral, except newly come-out girls. That was an established fact.

                              was whether they were compromised or not. Lady Newhaven was not, unless he chose to
                              compromise
                              her. No breath of scandal had ever touched her.

                              She had
                              been grievously frightened, too, at having been seen in equivocal circumstances by
                              such a man as
                              Captain Pratt. The very remembrance made her shiver.

                              me to write a little note to Captain Pratt, explaining how I came there, and asking
                              him not to
                              mention it. But, of course, he won't repeat it. He won't want to make an enemy of
                              me and Hugh.
                              The Pratts think so much of me. And when I marry Hugh”—(knock at the mental door)—“

                              talked freely of it to others. She had sung, as if it were her own composition, “Cleansing
                              Fires.” She often said it might have been written for her.

                              only natural that as her courage failed something else should take its place; an implacable
                              burning resentment against her two betrayers, her lover and her friend. She rocked
                              herself to
                              and fro. Lover and friend. “Oh! never, never trust in man's love or woman's friendship
                              henceforth for ever.” So learned Lady Newhaven the lesson of suffering.

                              prolonged scrutiny which filled her with vague alarm. She writhed under it. He observed
                              her
                              uneasiness, but he did not remove his eyes.

                              her to look at him. His hard eyes met her frightened blue ones. “You may rely on my

                              leading out of
                              her bedroom. She looked a mere shadow in the firelight.

                              sat so ill upon it. Her lustreless eyes fixed themselves again on the fire.

                              very well for
                              Dr. Brown to say she must be roused; but how were his instructions to be carried out?

                              in the

                              replace the one I had lost. Only if it were a child,” a little tremor broke the dead
                              level of
                              the passionless voice, “I should meet it again in heaven. There is the resurrection
                              of the body
                              for the children of the body, but there is no resurrection that I ever heard of for
                              the children

                              that the pang

                              own. They are often more like some one else than their parents, perhaps the spinster
                              sister-in-law, whom every one dislikes, or some entire alien. Look at Regie. He is
                              just like me,
                              which must be a great trial to Minna. And they grow up bewildering their parents at
                              every turn
                              by characteristics they don't understand. But she said the spiritual children, the
                              books, are
                              really ours.”

                           <p id="d75437e10892">“If you were other than you are,” said Hester, after a long pause, “you would reprove
                              me for
                              worshipping my own work. I suppose love is worship. I loved it for itself, not for
                              anything it
                              was to bring me. That is what people like Dr. Brown don't understand. It was part
                              of myself. But
                              it was the better part. The side of me which loves success, and which he is always
                              appealing to,
                              had no hand in it. My one prayer was that I might be worthy to write it, that it might
                              not
                              suffer by contact with me. I spent myself upon it.” Hester's voice sank. “I knew what
                              I was
                              doing. I joyfully spent my health, my eyesight, my very life upon it. I was impelled
                              to do it by
                              what you perhaps will call a blind instinct, what I, poor simpleton and dupe, believed
                              at the
                              time to be nothing less than the will of God.”

                              its mark and
                              influence upon your character. It has taught you a great deal. The mere fact of writing
                              it has
                              strengthened you. The outward and visible form is dead, but its spirit lives on in
                              you. You will
                              realise this presently.

                              the mouth of his prophets. Do you think I still blame poor James for his bonfire,

                              is in none the worse case for that. We are her two best friends save one. We must

                              the best Friend of all. God has her in His hand. For the moment the greater love holds
                              her away
                              from the less, like the mother who takes her sick child into her arms, apart from

                              Those who work mechanically on fixed lines seem as a rule to miss the pith of life.
                              She was kind
                              when she remembered them, but her heart was where her treasure was—namely, in her
                              escritoire,
                              with her list of Bible classes, and servants' choral unions, and the long roll of
                              contributors
                              to the guild of work which she herself had started.

                           <p id="d75437e11170">When she had been up to Hester's room, invariably at hours when Hester could not see
                              her, and
                              when she had entered Rachel's sledge-hammer subscriptions in her various account-books,
                              her
                              attention left her visitors. She considered them superficial, and wondered how it
                              was that her
                              brother could find time to spend hours talking to both of them, while he had rarely
                              a moment in
                              which to address her chosen band in the drawing-room. She was one of those persons
                              who find life
                              a very prosaic affair, quite unlike the fiction she occasionally read.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11173">She often remarked that nothing except the commonplace happened. Certainly she never
                              observed
                              anything else.

                           <p id="d75437e11178">So Hester lay in the room above halting feebly between two opinions, whether to live
                              or to die,
                              and Rachel sat in the Bishop's study beneath, waiting to make tea for him on his return
                              from the
                              confirmation.

                           <p id="d75437e11181">If she did not make it, no one else did. Instead of ringing for it he went without
                              it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11184">Rachel watched the sun set—a red ball dropping down a frosty sky. It was the last
                              day of the
                              year. The new year was bringing her everything.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11188">“Good-bye, good-bye,” she said, looking at the last rim of the sun as he sank. And
                              she remembered
                              other years when she had watched the sun set on the last day of December, when life
                              had been
                              difficult—how difficult!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11191">“If Hester could only get better I should have nothing left to wish for,” she said,
                              and she
                              prayed the more fervently for her friend, because she knew that even if Hester died,
                              life would
                              still remain beautiful; the future without her would still be flooded with happiness.

                           <p id="d75437e11194">“A year ago if Hester had died I should have had nothing left to live for,” she said
                              to herself.
                              “Now this newcomer, this man whom I have known barely six months, fills my whole life.
                              Are other
                              women as narrow as I am? Can they care only for one person at a time like me? Ah,
                              Hester!
                              forgive me, I can't help it.”

                           <p id="d75437e11197">Hugh was coming in presently. He had been in that morning, and the Bishop had met
                              him, and had
                              asked him to come in again to tea. Rachel did not know what the Bishop thought of
                              him, but he
                              had managed to see a good deal of Hugh.

                           <p id="d75437e11200">Rachel waited as impatiently as most of us, when our happiness lingers by us, loth
                              to depart.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11203">At last she heard the footman bringing some one across the hall.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11207">Would Hugh's coming ever become a common thing? Would she ever be able to greet him
                              without this
                              tumult of emotion, ever be able to take his hand without turning giddy on the sheer
                              verge of
                              bliss.

                           <p id="d75437e11215">The two women stood looking at each other. Rachel saw the marks of suffering on the
                              white face,
                              and her own became as white. Her eyes fell guiltily before Lady Newhaven's.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11218">“Forgive me,” she said.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11221">“Forgive you?” said Lady Newhaven in a hoarse voice. “It is no use asking me for
                              forgiveness.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11225">“You are right,” said Rachel, recovering herself, and meeting Lady Newhaven's eyes
                              fully. “But
                              what is the use of coming here to abuse me? You might have spared yourself and me
                              this at least.
                              It will only exhaust you and—wound me.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11228">“You must give him up,” said Lady Newhaven, her hands fumbling under her crape cloak.
                              “I've come
                              to tell you that you must let him go.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11231">The fact that Hugh had drawn the short lighter, and had not taken the consequences,
                              did not
                              affect Lady Newhaven's feelings towards him in the least, but she was vaguely aware
                              that somehow
                              it would affect Rachel's, and now it would be Rachel's turn to suffer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11234">Rachel paused a moment, and then said slowly:</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11237">“He does not wish to be let go.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11240">“He is mine.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11244">“He was yours once,” said Rachel, her face turning from white to grey. That wound
                              was long in
                              healing. “But he is mine now.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11247">“Rachel, you cannot be bad all through.” Lady Newhaven was putting the constraint
                              upon herself
                              which that tightly clutched paper, that poisoned weapon in reserve, enabled her to
                              assume. For
                              Hugh's sake she would only use it if other means failed. “You must know that you ought
                              to look
                              upon him as a married man. Don't you see?”—wildly—“that we must marry, to put right
                              what was
                              wrong. He owes it to me. People always do.”

                           <p id="d75437e11250">“Yes, they generally do,” said Rachel; “but I don't see how it makes the wrong right.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11253">“I look upon Hugh as my husband,” said Lady Newhaven.</p>

                              obeyed. “If I gave back Hugh to you a hundred times it would not make him love you

                              make him marry you. I am not keeping him from you. This marriage is his own doing.
                              Oh! Violet,
                              I'm not young and pretty. I've no illusions about myself; but I believe he really
                              does love me,
                              in spite of that, and I know I love him.”

                           <p id="d75437e11281">“I don't believe it,” said Lady Newhaven. “I mean about him. Not about you, of course.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11284">“Here he is. Let him decide,” said Rachel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11287">Hugh came in unannounced. Upon his grave face there was that concentrated look of
                              happiness which
                              has settled in the very deep of the heart, and gleams up into the eyes.

                              would fain have spared him, but she could not.

                              talking of
                              you. I think it would be best if she heard from your own lips what she naturally will

                              nothing to you, and that you will cast me aside for another woman.”

                           <p id="d75437e11300">Hugh looked at her steadily. Then he went up to Rachel, and taking her hand, raised
                              it to his
                              lips. There was in his manner a boundless reverent adoration that was to Lady New.

                              jealousy as a match to gunpowder.

                              a chair for
                              support. “He has cast me aside. He will cast you aside next, for he is a coward and
                              a traitor.
                              Are you sure you want to marry him? His hands are red with blood. He murdered my husband.”

                           <p id="d75437e11318">“It was an even chance,” shrieked Lady Newhaven. “But who drew the short lighter,

                           <p id="d75437e11324">“I can prove it,” said Lady Newhaven, holding out the letter in her shaking hands.
                              “You may read
                              it, Rachel. I can trust you. Not him, he would burn it. It is from Edward; look, you
                              know his
                              writing, written to tell me that he,” pointing at Hugh, “had drawn the short lighter,
                              but that,
                              as he had not killed himself when the time came, he, Edward, did so instead. That
                              was why he was
                              late. We always wondered, Rachel, why he was two days late. Read it. Read it.”

                           <p id="d75437e11327">“I will not read it,” said Rachel, pushing away the paper. “I do not believe a word

                           <p id="d75437e11333">“You need not trouble to deny it,” said Rachel, looking full at Hugh.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11337">The world held only her and him. And as Hugh looked into her eyes his soul rose up
                              and scaled the
                              heights above it till it stood beside hers.

                              earthly quiver and his bitter arrows, and turn to us as he is, with the light of God
                              upon him,
                              one with us as one with God. In that pure light lies cease to be. We know them no

                              and threw it into the heart of the fire. Then he turned to Rachel.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11348">“I drew the short lighter,” he said. “I meant to take the consequences at first, but
                              when the
                              time came—I did not. Partly I was afraid, and partly I could not leave you.”

                           <p id="d75437e11351">If Lady Newhaven yearned for revenge she had it then. They had both forgotten her.
                              But she saw
                              Rachel's eyes change as the eyes of a man at the stake might change when the fire
                              reached him.
                              She shrank back from the agony in them. Hugh's face became pinched and thin as a dead
                              man's. A
                              moment ago he saw no consequences. He saw only that he could not lie to her. His mind
                              fell
                              headlong from its momentary foothold. What mad impulse had betrayed him to his ruin?

                              Rachel, her
                              voice almost inaudible in its fierce passion. “You drew it, and you let him die instead
                              of you,
                              as any one who knew him would know he would. And when he was dead you came to me,
                              and kept me in
                              ignorance even—that time—when I said I trusted you.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11358">The remembrance of that meeting was too much.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11361">Rachel turned her eyes on Lady Newhaven who was watching her terror-stricken.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11364">“I said I would not give him up, but I will,” she said violently. “You can take him
                              if you want
                              him. What was it you said to me, Hugh? That if you had drawn the short lighter you
                              would have
                              had to abide by it. Yes, that was it. Your whole intercourse with me has been one
                              lie from first
                              to last. You were right, Violet, when you said he ought to marry you. It will be another
                              lie on
                              the top of all the others.”

                           <p id="d75437e11367">“It was what Edward wished,” faltered his widow. “He says so in the letter that has
                              just been
                              burnt.”

                           <p id="d75437e11370">“Lord Newhaven wished it,” said Rachel, looking at the miserable man between them.
                              “Poor Lord
                              Newhaven! First his honour. Then his life. You have taken everything he had. But there
                              are still
                              his shoes.”

                              of her
                              gown.

                           <p id="d75437e11382">“Leave me,” she whispered. Her voice was almost gone. “Coward and liar, I will have
                              nothing more
                              to do with you.”

                           <p id="d75437e11385">He got upon his feet somehow. The two grey desperate faces spent with passion faced
                              each other.
                              They were past speech.

                           <p id="d75437e11388">He read his death warrant in her merciless eyes. She looked at the despair in his

                              anger that mimics the pallor of a fainting fit. The Bishop thought she was about to

                              he saw her eyes. Those gentle faithful eyes were burning. He shrank as one who sees
                              the glare of

                           <p id="d75437e11443">Rachel still stood. She looked at him, and her lips moved, but no sound came forth.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11446">The Bishop looked intently at her.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e11452">“Hugh is gone,” she said stammering. “I have broken off my engagement with him. He
                              will never
                              come back.”

                           <p id="d75437e11456">And she fell suddenly on her knees, and hid her convulsed face against the arm of
                              a chair.

                           <p id="d75437e11459">The Bishop did not move. He waited for this paroxysm of anger to subside. He had never
                              seen
                              Rachel angry before in all the years he had known her, but he watched her without<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="352" data-tei-n="351"> </a></span> surprise. Only stupid people think that coal cannot burn as fiercely

                           <p id="d75437e11464">She remained a long time on her knees, her face hidden. The Bishop did not hurry her.
                              At last she
                              began to sob silently, shuddering from head to foot.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11467">Then he came and sat down near her, and took the cold clenched hands in his.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11470">“Rachel, tell me,” he said gently.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11473">She tried to pull her hands away; but he held them firmly. He obliged her to look
                              up at him. She
                              raised her fierce disfigured face for a moment, and then let it fall on his hands
                              and hers.

                              have kept all suffering from him, but now—if I could make him suffer—I would.”

                              man I loved, like you, only I have not found you out yet, like Hester, like all the
                              rest. I will
                              never trust any one again. I will never be deceived again. This is—the—second time.”

                           <p id="d75437e11486">And Rachel broke into a passion of tears.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11489">The Bishop released her hands, and felt for his own handkerchief.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11492">Then he waited, praying silently. The clock had made a long circuit before she raised
                              herself.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11496">“I am very selfish,” she said looking with compunction at the kind tried face. “I
                              ought to have
                              gone to my room instead of breaking down here. Dear Bishop, forgive me. It is past
                              now. I shall
                              not give way again.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11499">“Will you make me some tea?” he said.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11502">She made the tea with shaking hands, and awkward half-blind movements. It was close
                              on dinner
                              time, but she did not notice it. He obliged her to drink some, and then he settled
                              himself in
                              his leather armchair. He went over his<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="353" data-tei-n="352"> </a></span> engagements for the
                              evening. In half an hour he ought to be dining with Canon Glynn to meet an old college
                              friend.
                              At eleven he had arranged to see a young clergyman whose conscience was harrying him.
                              He wrote a
                              note on his knee without moving saying he could not come, and touched the bell at
                              his elbow.
                              When the servant had taken the note, he relapsed into the depths of his armchair,
                              and sipped his
                              tea.

                           <p id="d75437e11507">“I think, Rachel,” he said at last, “that I ought to tell you that I partly guess
                              at your reason
                              for breaking off your engagement. I have known for some time that there was trouble
                              between the
                              Newhavens. From what Lady Newhaven said to me to-day, and from the fact that she has
                              been here,
                              and that immediately after seeing her you broke your engagement with Scarlett, I must
                              come to
                              the conclusion that Scarlett had been the cause of this trouble.”

                           <p id="d75437e11510">Rachel had regained her composure. Her face was white and hard.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11513">“You are right,” she said. “He was at one time—her lover.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11517">“And you consider, in consequence, that he is unfit to become your husband?”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11520">“No. He told me about it before he asked me to marry him. I accepted him, knowing

                           <p id="d75437e11526">Rachel laughed. “So I thought at the time.”</p>

                              drawn it;
                              how when the time came he had failed to fulfil the agreement; how two days later Lord

                              had killed himself; and how she and Lady Newhaven had both, of course, concluded that

                              spoke of it, but just because he risked losing me by owning it I loved and trusted

                              for Lord Newhaven's death. He had brought it on himself. I said to him”—Rachel's voice

                           <p id="d75437e11587">There was a long silence.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11590">“I don't know how other people regard those things,” said Rachel at last, less harshly—she
                              was
                              gradually recovering herself—“but I know to me it was much worse that he could deceive
                              me than
                              that he should have been Lady Newhaven's lover. I did feel that dreadfully. I had
                              to choke down
                              my jealousy when he kissed me. He had kissed her first. He had made that side of his
                              love common
                              and profane; but the other side remained. I clung to that. I believed he really loved
                              me, and
                              that supported me and enabled me to forgive him, though men don't know what that forgiveness
                              costs us. Only the walls of our rooms know that. But it seems to me much worse to
                              have failed me
                              on that other side as well—to have deceived me—to have told me a lie—just when—just
                              when we were
                              talking intimately.”

                           <p id="d75437e11597">“And it was the action of a coward to draw lots in the first instance if he did not

                              them. But
                              yet, if he had told me—if he had only told me the whole truth—I loved him so entirely
                              that I
                              would have forgiven-

                              he had only
                              admitted it and been straightforward with me. A little plain dealing was all I asked,
                              but—I did

                           <p id="d75437e11609">The Bishop looked sadly at her. Straightforwardness is so seldom the first requirement
                              a woman
                              makes of the man she loves. Women, as a rule, regard men and their conduct only from
                              the point
                              of view of their relation to women—as sons, as husbands, as fathers. Yet Rachel, it
                              seemed,
                              could forgive<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="356" data-tei-n="355"> </a></span> Hugh's sin against her as a woman, but not his

                           <p id="d75437e11640">“Listen to me, Rachel,” he said. “You fell desperately in love with an inferior man.
                              He is
                              charming, refined, well-bred, and with a picturesque mind, but that is all. He is
                              inferior. He
                              is by nature shallow and hard (the two generally go together), without moral backbone,
                              the kind
                              of man who never faces a difficulty, who always flinches when it comes to the point,
                              the stuff
                              out of which liars and cowards are made. His one redeeming quality is his love for
                              you. I have
                              seen men in love before. I have never seen a man care more for a woman than he cares
                              for you.
                              His love for you has taken entire possession of him, and by it he will sink or swim.”

                           <p id="d75437e11646">“He deceived you,” said the Bishop, “not because he wished to deceive you, but because
                              he was in
                              a horrible position, and because his first impulse of love was to keep you at any
                              price. But his
                              love for you was raising him even while he deceived you. Did he spend sleepless nights
                              because
                              for months he vilely deceived Lord Newhaven? No. Rectitude was not in him. His conscience
                              was
                              not awake. But I tell you, Rachel, he has suffered like a man on the rack from deceiving
                              you. I
                              knew by his face as soon as I him that he was undergoing some great mental strain.
                              I did not
                              understand it, but I do now.”

                              moment; his
                              love for you which has brought him for the first time to the perception of the higher

                              the need of God's forgiveness, which I know from things he has said, has made him

                              in him, he shook off for an instant the clogs of the nature which he brought into
                              the world, and
                              rose to what he had never been before—your equal. And his love transcended the lies
                              that love
                              itself on its lower plane had prompted. He reached the place where he could no longer

                              you. And then, though his whole future happiness depended on one more lie, he spoke
                              the

                              inexorably. “You say you loved him, and yet—you spurned him from you, you thrust him
                              down into
                              hell. You stooped to him in the beginning. He was nothing until your fancied love
                              fell upon him.
                              And then you break him. It is women like you who do more harm in the world than the
                              bad ones.
                              The harm that poor fool Lady Newhaven did him is as nothing compared to the harm you
                              have done
                              him. You were his god, and you have deserted him. And you say you loved him. May God
                              preserve
                              men from the love of women if that is all that a good woman's love is capable of.”

                              transgressions, I suppose that meant that He felt as if they were His own in His great

                              us. But when you shrink from bearing your fellow creature's transgressions, it shows

                              <hi id="d75437e11775" style="font-size: larger;font-weight: bold;">HOW</hi> Hugh shook off Lady Newhaven when she followed him out of the Palace
                              he did not know. There had been some difficulty. She had spoken to him, had urged
                              something upon
                              him. But he had got rid of her somehow, and had found himself sitting in his bedroom
                              at the
                              Southminster Hotel. Anything to be alone! He had felt that was the one thing in life
                              to attain.
                              But now that he was alone solitude suddenly took monstrous and hideous proportions,
                              and became a
                              horror to flee from. He could not bear the face of a fellow creature. He could not
                              bear this
                              ghoul of solitude. There was no room for him between these great millstones. They
                              pressed upon
                              him till he felt they were crushing him to death between them. In vain he endeavoured
                              to compose
                              himself, to recollect himself. But exhaustion gradually did for him what he could
                              not do for
                              himself.

                           <p id="d75437e11779">Rachel had thrown him over. He had always known she would, and—she had.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11783">They were to have been married in a few weeks; three weeks and one day. He marked
                              a day off every
                              morning when he waked. He had thought of her as his wife till the thought had become
                              part of
                              himself. Its roots were in his inmost being. He tore it out now, and looked at it
                              apart from
                              himself, as a man bleeding and shuddering looks upon a dismembered limb.

                           <p id="d75437e11788">The sweat broke from Hugh's forehead. The waiting and daily parting had seemed unbearable,
                              that
                              short waiting of a few weeks. Now she would never be his. That long, ever-growing
                              hunger of the
                              heart would never be appeased. She had taken herself away, taking away with her her
                              dear hands
                              and her faithful eyes and the low voice, the very sound of which brought comfort and
                              peace. They
                              were his hands and eyes. She had given them to him. And now she had wrenched them
                              away again,
                              those faithful eyes had seared him with their scorn, those white hands against which
                              he had
                              leaned his forehead, had thrust him violently from her. He could not live without
                              her. This was
                              death, to be parted from her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11791">“I can't, Rachel, I can't,” said Hugh, over and over again. What was any lesser death,
                              compared
                              to this, compared to her contempt?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11794">She would never come back. She despised him. She would never love him any more. He
                              had told her
                              that it must be a dream that she could love him, and that he should wake. And she
                              had said it
                              was all quite true. How sweetly she had said it. But it was a dream after all, and
                              he
                              
                              <emph id="d75437e11796">had</emph> waked—in torment. Life as long as he lived would be like this moment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11800">“I will not bear it,” he said suddenly, with the frantic instinct of escape which
                              makes a man
                              climb out of a burning house over a window ledge. Far down is the pavement, quiet,
                              impassive,
                              deadly. But behind is the blast of the furnace. Panic staggers between the two and—jumps.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11804">“I will not bear it,” said Hugh, tears of anguish welling up into his eyes.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11807">He had not only lost her, but he had lost himself. That better humble earnest self
                              had gone away
                              with Rachel, and he was thrust back on the old false cowardly self whom since she
                              had loved him
                              he had abhorred. He had disowned it. He had cast it off. Now it enveloped him again
                              like a shirt
                              of fire, and a voice within him said, “This is the real you. You deceived yourself
                              for a moment.
                              But this is the real you, the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="362" data-tei-n="361"> </a></span> liar, the coward, the traitor,

                           <p id="d75437e11812">“I am forsaken,” said Hugh. He repeated the words over and over again. “Forsaken.
                              Forsaken.” And
                              he looked round for a way of escape.

                           <p id="d75437e11815">Somewhere in the back of his mind a picture hung which he had seen once and never
                              looked at
                              again. He turned and looked at it now, as a man turns and looks at a picture on the
                              wall behind
                              him.

                           <p id="d75437e11818">He saw it again, the still upturned face of the little lake among its encircling trees,
                              as he had
                              seen it that day when he and Doll came suddenly upon it in the woods. What had it
                              to do with
                              him? He had escaped from it once. 
                              <emph id="d75437e11820">He understood now</emph>.

                              when life is
                              unbearable! “Come down to me among my tall water plants,” it says. “I am a refuge,
                              a way of
                              escape. This horror and nightmare of life cannot reach you in my bosom. Come down
                              to me. I
                              promise nothing but to lay my cool hand upon the fire in your brain, and that the
                              world shall
                              release its clutch upon you, the world which promises, and will not keep its promises.
                              I will

                           <p id="d75437e11828">Hugh's mind wavered, as the flame of a candle wavers in a sudden draught. So had it
                              wavered once
                              in the fear of death, and he had yielded to that fear. So it wavered now in a greater
                              fear, the
                              fear of life, and he yielded to that fear.

                           <p id="d75437e11837">Presently he had left the town, and was in the open country. Where was he going along
                              this
                              interminable road in this dim snow light?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11840">The night was very still. The spirit of the frost stooped<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="363" data-tei-n="362"> </a></span> over
                              the white face of the earth. The long homely lines of meadow and wold and hedgerow
                              showed like
                              the austere folds of a shroud.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11845">Hugh walked swiftly, looking neither to right nor left. The fire in his brain mounted,
                              mounted.
                              The moon, entangled in a dim thicket, got up behind him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11849">At last he stopped short. That farm on the right! He had seen it before. Yes. That
                              was
                              Greenfields. Doll had pointed it out to him when they had walked on that Sunday afternoon
                              to
                              Beaumere. They had left the road here, and had taken to the fields. There was the
                              gate. Hugh
                              opened it. Crack had been lost here and had rejoined them in the wood. The field was
                              empty. A
                              path like a crease ran across it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11852">He knew the way. It was the only way of escape from this shadow in front of him, this
                              other self
                              who had come back to him, and torn Rachel from him, and made her hate him. She loved
                              him really.
                              She was faithful. She would never have forsaken him. But she had mistaken this evil
                              creeping
                              shadow for him, and he had not been able to explain. But she would understand presently.
                              He
                              would make it all very clear and plain, and she would love him again, when he had
                              got rid of
                              this other Hugh. He would take him down and drown him in Beaumere. It was the only
                              way to get
                              rid of him. And he, the real Hugh, would get safely through. He had done it once,
                              and he knew.
                              He should stifle and struggle for a little while. There was a turn exceeding sharp
                              to be passed,
                              but he should reach that place of peace beyond, as he had done before, and find Rachel
                              waiting
                              for him, her arms round him again.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11855">“It is the only way,” he said over and over again, “the only way.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11858">He reached the wood. The moon was up now, and smote white and sharp down the long
                              winding aisle
                              of the cathedral which God builds Him in every forest glade, where the hoar frost
                              and the snow
                              held now their solemn service of praise.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11861">Hugh saw the little light of the keeper's cottage, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="364" data-tei-n="363"> </a></span>
                              instinctively edged his way to the left. He was pressed for time. A wheel was turning
                              in his
                              head, so quickly, so quickly in this great heat that, unless he were quicker than
                              it, it would
                              out-distance him altogether.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11866">At last he saw the water, and ran down swiftly towards it. The white tree-trunks were
                              in league
                              against him, and waylaid him, striking him violently. But he struck back, and got
                              through them.
                              They fell behind at last. His shadow was beside him now, short and nimble. He looked
                              round once
                              or twice to make sure it was still with him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11870">He reached the water's edge and then stopped short, aghast. Where was the water gone?
                              It had
                              deceived him and deserted him, like everything else. It was all hard as iron, one
                              great white
                              sheet of ice stretching away in front of him. He had thought of the little lake as
                              he had last
                              seen it, cool and deep, and with the shadows of the summer trees in it. It was all
                              changed and
                              gone. There was no help here. The way of escape was closed. With a hoarse cry he set
                              off,
                              running across the ice in the direction of the place where he had been nearly drowned
                              before.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11873">It was here, opposite that clump of silver birch. The ice was a different colour here.
                              It tilted
                              and creaked suddenly beneath his feet. He flung himself down upon it and struck it
                              wildly with
                              his fist. “Let me through,” he stammered. But the ice resisted him. It made an ominous
                              dry
                              crackling as if in mockery. It barely resisted him, but it did resist him. And he
                              had no time,
                              no time. He scrambled to his feet again, and it gave way instantly. The other self
                              pounced
                              suddenly upon him and came through with him, and they struggled furiously together
                              in deep
                              water.

                           <p id="d75437e11876">“I must, I must,” gasped Hugh between his clenched teeth.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11879">“You shall not,” said the other self, mad with terror. “Hold on to the ice.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11882">Hugh saw his bleeding hands holding tightly to the jagged edge. It broke. He clutched
                              another
                              piece. It broke again. The current was sucking him slowly under the ice.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="365" data-tei-n="364"> </a></span> The broken pieces pushed him. One arm was under already, and he could
                              not get it out. The animal horror of a trap seized him. He had not known it would
                              be like this.
                              He was not prepared for this.

                           <p id="d75437e11887">The other self fought furiously for life, clutching and tearing at the breaking ice.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11891">“Call,” it said to him, “while there is still time.”</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11894">Hugh set his teeth.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11897">The ice broke in a great piece and tilted heavily against him. It was over one shoulder.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e11900">“Call,” said the other self sharply again, “or you will be under the ice.”</p>

                              by, and added slowly. “He was kept. He was on his way here from Wilderleigh, where

                              servants is ill, and as I was dining there he offered me a lift back. And when we

                              that farm near the wood a man stopped us. He said there had been an accident—some
                              one nearly
                              drowned. I went, too. It turned out to be Scarlett. Dr. Brown remained with him, and
                              sent me to
                              take you to him.”

                              her. Dick
                              turned up the collar of his fur coat, and climbed up beside the coachman.

                              road. At last, when he had given up all hope, it turned into a field and jolted heavily
                              over the
                              frozen ruts. Then it came to a standstill.

                              was open.
                              Dr. Brown was looking out.

                              up from the
                              fireside as she came in. He opened the door into the little parlour.

                              the door, the wide eyes were fixed on the candle on the table. The lips moved continually.
                              The
                              hands were picking at the blankets.

                           <p id="d75437e12108">For the first moment Rachel did not know him. How could this be Hugh? How could these

                           <p id="d75437e12139">“Yes,” said Dick, “and he got in where any one who knew the look of ice would have

                              be sure to get in. The keeper watched him cross the ice. It was some time before they
                              could get
                              near him to get him out, and it seems there is some injury.”

                           <p id="d75437e12142">Dr. Brown came slowly out, half closing the parlour-door behind him.</p>

                           <p id="d75437e12152">“No. He may know her at the last, but it is doubtful. I can do nothing, and I am wanted
                              elsewhere.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e12155">“I will stop,” said the Bishop.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e12158">“Shall I take you back?” said Dr. Brown, looking at Dick. But Dick shook his head.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e12161">“I might be of use to her,” he said when the doctor had gone.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d75437e12164">So the two men who loved Rachel sat in impotent compassion in the little kitchen through
                              the
                              interminable hours of the night. At long intervals the Bishop went quietly into the
                              parlour, but
                              apparently he was not wanted there. Once he went out and got a fresh candle, and put
                              it into the
                              tin candlestick, and set it among the china ornaments on wool-work mats.

                              The
                              restless fever of movement was past. She almost wished it back, so far, so far was
                              his life
                              ebbing away from hers.

                              listened intently. She could make no sense of what he said. The few words she could
                              catch were
                              repeated a hundred times amid an unintelligible murmur. The boat, and Loftus, and
                              her own
                              name—and Crack. Who was Crack? She remembered the little dog which had been drowned.
                              And the
                              lips which were so soon to be silent talked on incoherently while Rachel's heart broke
                              for a

                              were here. Through the low uncurtained window Rachel could see the first wan light
                              of the new
                              day and the new year.

                              through, and I shall find her upon the other side, as I did before. It is very cold,

                           <p id="d75437e12201">He sat up, and looked directly at her. He seemed suddenly freed, released. A boyish

                              had never seen came into his face, a look which remained in Rachel's heart while she
                              lived.

                              how, but I came to you through the water. I knew I should find you, my Rachel, my

                              they would not let us see her. It was only hysteria, which girls get when they are

                              at not marrying, and are not so young as they were. Directly poor Mr. Scarlett died,

                              her room, and devoted herself to Miss West, and Dr. Brown said it was the saving of

                              my part I always thought Hester took in Dr. Brown and the Bishop about that illness.”

                              shut up the book at a sad page we say hastily “Life is sad.” But it is not so. There
                              are other
                              pages waiting to be turned. I, who have copied out one little chapter of the lives
                              of Rachel and
                              Hester, cannot see plainly, but I catch glimpses of those other pages. I seem to see
                              Rachel with
                              children round her, and Dick not far off, and the old light rekindled in Hester's
                              eyes. For Hope
                              and Love and Enthusiasm never die. We think in youth that we bury them in the graveyards
                              of our
                              hearts, but the grass never yet grew over them. How,then, can life be sad, when they
                              walk beside
                              us always in the growing light towards the Perfect Day.
