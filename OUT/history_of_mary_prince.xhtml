                        <p id="d14544e169">THE idea of writing Mary Prince's history was first suggested by herself. She wished
                           it to be done, she said, that good people in 
                           <placeName id="d14544e171" ref="#England">England"&gt;</placeName> might hear from a slave what a slave had felt and suffered;
                           and a letter of her late master's, which will be found in the Supplement, induced
                           me
                           to accede to her wish without farther delay. The more immediate object of the
                           publication will afterwards appear.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e175">The narrative was taken down from Mary's own lips by a lady who happened to be at
                           the
                           time residing in my family as a visitor. It was written out fully, with all the
                           narrator's repetitions and prolixities, and afterwards pruned into its present shape;
                           retaining, as far as was practicable, Mary's exact expressions and peculiar
                           phraseology. No fact of importance has been omitted, and not a single circumstance
                           or
                           sentiment has been added. It is essentially her own, without any material alteration
                           farther than was requisite to exclude redundances and gross grammatical errors, so
                           as
                           to render it clearly intelligible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e178">After it had been thus written out, I went over the whole, carefully examining her
                           on
                           every fact and circumstance detailed; and in all that relates to her residence in
                           Antigua I had the advantage of being assisted in this scrutiny by 
                           <persName id="d14544e180">Mr.
                              
                              <forename id="d14544e182">Joseph</forename>
                              
                              <surname id="d14544e185">Phillips</surname>
                           </persName>, who was a resident in that colony during
                           the same period, and had known her there.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e189">The names of all the persons mentioned by the narrator have been printed in full,
                           except those of Capt. I—— and his wife, and that of Mr. D——, to whom conduct of
                           peculiar atrocity is ascribed. These three individuals are now gone to answer at a
                           far more awful tribunal than that of public opinion, for the deeds of which their
                           former bondwoman accuses them; and to hold them up more openly to human reprobation
                           could no longer affect themselves, while it might deeply lacerate the feelings of

                           and the West Indies, and he was seldom at home long together.

                        <p id="d14544e255">Mrs. Williams was a kind-hearted good woman, and she treated all her slaves well.
                           She
                           had only one daughter, Miss Betsey, for whom I was purchased, and who was about my
                           own age. I was made quite a pet of by Miss Betsey, and loved her very much. She used
                           to lead me about by the hand, and call me her little nigger. This was the happiest
                           period of my life; for I was too young to understand rightly my condition as a slave,
                           and too thoughtless and full of spirits to look forward to the days of toil and
                           sorrow.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e258">My mother was a household slave in the same family. I was under her own care, and
                           my
                           little brothers and sisters were my play-fellows and companions. My mother had
                           several fine children after she came to Mrs. Williams,—three girls and two boys. The
                           tasks given out to us children were light, and we used to play together with Miss
                           Betsey, with as much freedom almost as if she had been our sister.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e262">My master, however, was a very harsh, selfish man; and we always dreaded his return
                           from sea. His wife was herself much afraid of him; and, during his stay at home,
                           seldom dared to shew her usual kindness to the slaves. He often left her, in the most
                           distressed circumstances, to reside in other female society, at some place in the
                           West Indies of which I have forgot the name. My poor mistress bore his ill-treatment
                           with great patience, and all her slaves loved and pitied her. I was truly attached
                           to
                           her, and, next to my own mother, loved her better than any creature in the world.
                           My
                           obedience to her commands was cheerfully <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="1" data-tei-n="2"> </a></span> given: it sprung
                           solely from the affection I felt for her, and not from fear of the power which the
                           white people's law had given her over me.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e267">I had scarcely reached my twelfth year when my mistress became too poor to keep so
                           many of us at home; and she hired me out to Mrs. Pruden, a lady who lived about five
                           miles off, in the adjoining parish, in a large house near the sea. I cried bitterly
                           at parting with my dear mistress and Miss Betsey, and when I kissed my mother and
                           brothers and sisters, I thought my young heart would break, it pained me so. But
                           there was no help; I was forced to go. Good Mrs. Williams comforted me by saying that
                           I should still be near the home I was about to quit, and might come over and see her
                           and my kindred whenever I could obtain leave of absence from Mrs. Pruden. A few hours
                           after this I was taken to a strange house, and found myself among strange people.
                           This separation seemed a sore trial to me then; but oh! 'twas light, light to the
                           trials I have since endured!—'twas nothing—nothing to be mentioned with them; but
                           I
                           was a child then, and it was according to my strength.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e270">I knew that Mrs. Williams could no longer maintain me; that she was fain to part with
                           me for my food and clothing; and I tried to submit myself to the change. My new
                           mistress was a passionate woman; but yet she did not treat me very unkindly. I do
                           not
                           remember her striking me but once, and that was for going to see Mrs. Williams when
                           I
                           heard she was sick, and staying longer than she had given me leave to do. All my
                           employment at this time was nursing a sweet baby, little Master Daniel; and I grew
                           so
                           fond of my nursling that it was my greatest delight to walk out with him by the
                           sea-shore, accompanied by his brother and sister, Miss Fanny and Master James.—Dear
                           Miss Fanny! She was a sweet, kind young lady, and so fond of me that she wished me
                           to
                           learn all that she knew herself; and her method of teaching me was as
                           follows:—Directly she had said her lessons to her grandmamma, she used to come
                           running to me, and make me repeat them one by one after her; and in a few months I
                           was able not only to say my letters but to spell many small words. But this happy
                           state was not to last long. Those days were too pleasant to last. My heart always
                           softens when I think of them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e273">At this time Mrs. Williams died. I was told suddenly of her death, and my grief was
                           so great that, forgetting I had the baby in my arms, I ran away directly to my poor
                           mistress's house; but reached it only in time to see the corpse carried out. Oh, that
                           was a day of sorrow,—a heavy day! All the slaves cried. My mother cried and lamented
                           her sore; and I (foolish creature!) vainly entreated them to bring my dear mistress
                           back to life. I knew nothing rightly about death then, and it seemed a hard thing
                           to
                           bear. When I thought about my mistress I felt as if the world was all gone wrong;
                           and
                           for many days and weeks I could think of nothing else. I returned to Mrs. Pruden's;
                           but my sorrow was too great to be comforted, for my own dear mistress was always in
                           my mind. Whether in the house or abroad, my thoughts were always talking to me about
                           her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e276">I staid at Mrs. Pruden's about three months after this; I was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="2" data-tei-n="3"> </a></span>
                           then sent back to Mr. Williams to be sold. Oh, that was a sad sad time! I recollect
                           the day well. Mrs. Pruden came to me and said, “Mary, you will have to go home
                           directly; your master is going to be married, and he means to sell you and two of
                           your sisters to raise money for the wedding.” Hearing this I burst out a
                           crying,—though I was then far from being sensible of the full weight of my
                           misfortune, or of the misery that waited for me. Besides, I did not like to leave
                           Mrs. Pruden, and the dear baby, who had grown very fond of me. For some time I could
                           scarcely believe that Mrs. Pruden was in earnest, till I received orders for my
                           immediate return.—Dear Miss Fanny! how she cried at parting with me, whilst I kissed
                           and hugged the baby, thinking I should never see him again. I left Mrs. Pruden's,
                           and
                           walked home with a heart full of sorrow. The idea of being sold away from my mother
                           and Miss Betsey was so frightful, that I dared not trust myself to think about it.
                           We
                           had been bought of Mr. Myners, as I have mentioned, by Miss Betsey's grandfather,
                           and
                           given to her, so that we were by right 
                           <hi id="d14544e280" style="font-style: italic;">her</hi> property, and I
                           never thought we should be separated or sold away from her.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e284">When I reached the house, I went in directly to Miss Betsey. I found her in great
                           distress; and she cried out as soon as she saw me, “Oh, Mary! my father is going to
                           sell you all to raise money to marry that wicked woman. You are 
                           <hi id="d14544e286" style="font-style: italic;">my</hi> slaves, and he has no right to sell you; but it is all to please her.”
                           She then told me that my mother was living with her father's sister at a house close
                           by, and I went there to see her. It was a sorrowful meeting; and we lamented with
                           a
                           great and sore crying our unfortunate situation. “Here comes one of my poor
                           picaninnies!” she said, the moment I came in, “one of the poor slave-brood who are
                           to
                           be sold to-morrow.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e291">Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,—it is too much.—It recalls the great
                           grief that filled my heart, and the woeful thoughts that passed to and fro through
                           my
                           mind, whilst listening to the pitiful words of my poor mother, weeping for the loss
                           of her children. I wish I could find words to tell you all I then felt and suffered.
                           The great God above alone knows the thoughts of the poor slave's heart, and the
                           bitter pains which follow such separations as these. All that we love taken away from
                           us—Oh, it is sad, sad! and sore to be borne!—I got no sleep that night for thinking
                           of the morrow; and dear Miss Betsey was scarcely less distressed. She could not bear
                           to part with her old playmates, and she cried sore and would not be pacified.

                        <p id="d14544e294">The black morning at length came; it came too soon for my poor mother and us. Whilst
                           she was putting on us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be sold, she said, in
                           a
                           sorrowful voice, (I shall never forget it!) “See, I am 
                           <hi id="d14544e296" style="font-style: italic;">shrouding</hi> my poor children; what a task for a mother!”—She then called Miss
                           Betsey to take leave of us. “I am going to carry my little chickens to market,”
                           (these were her very words.) “take your last look of them: may be you will see them
                           no more.” “Oh, my poor slaves! my own slaves!” said dear Miss Betsey, “you belong
                           to
                           me: and it grieves my heart to part with you.”—Miss Betsey kissed us all, and, when
                           she left us, my mother called the rest of the slaves to bid us good bye. One of them,
                           a woman named Moll, <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="3" data-tei-n="4"> </a></span> came with her infant in her arms. “Ay!”
                           said my mother, seeing her turn away and look at her child with the tears in her
                           eyes, “your turn will come next.“ The slaves could say nothing to comfort us; they
                           could only weep and lament with us. When I left my dear little brothers and the house
                           in which I had been brought up, I thought my heart would burst.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e302">Our mother, weeping as she went, called me away with the children Hannah and Dinah,
                           and we took the road that led to Hamble Town, which we reached about four o'clock
                           in
                           the afternoon. We followed my mother to the market-place, where she placed us in a
                           row against a large house, with our backs to the wall and our arms folded across our
                           breasts. I, as the eldest, stood first, Hannah next to me, then Dinah; and our mother
                           stood beside, crying over us. My heart throbbed with grief and terror so violently,
                           that I pressed my hands quite tightly across my breast, but I could not keep it
                           still, and it continued to leap as though it would burst out of my body. But who
                           cared for that? Did one of the many by-standers, who were looking at us so
                           carelessly, think of the pain that wrung the hearts of the negro woman and her young
                           ones? No, no! They were not all bad, I dare say, but slavery hardens white people's
                           hearts towards the blacks; and many of them were not slow to make their remarks upon
                           us aloud, without regard to our grief—though their light words fell like cayenne on
                           the fresh wounds of our hearts. Oh those white people have small hearts who can only
                           feel for themselves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e305">At length the vendue master, who was to offer us for sale like sheep or cattle,
                           arrived, and asked my mother which was the eldest. She said nothing, but pointed to
                           me. He took me by the hand, and led me out into the middle of the street, and,
                           turning me slowly round, exposed me to the view of those who attended the vendue.
                           I
                           was soon surrounded by strange men, who examined and handled me in the same manner
                           that a butcher would a calf or a lamb he was about to purchase, and who talked about
                           my shape and size in like words—as if I could no more understand their meaning than
                           the dumb beasts. I was then put up to sale. The bidding commenced at a few pounds,
                           and gradually rose to fifty-seven,<a href="n1" class="ref-external" id="ref1">*</a><a class="note-marker" href="#d14544e309">02</a><note data-tapas-note-num="02" id="n1" anchored="true" target="ref1">

                              of this negro woman, with the following description of a vendue of slaves at the
                              Cape of Good Hope, published by me in 1826, from the letter of a friend, —and mark
                              their similarity in several characteristic circumstances. The resemblance is
                              easily accounted for: slavery wherever it prevails produces similar
                              effects.—“Having heard that there was to be a sale of cattle, farm stock, &amp;c.
                              by auction, at a Veld-Cornet's in the vicinity, we halted our waggon one day for
                              the purpose of procuring a fresh

                              </sic> of oxen. Among
                              the stock of the farm sold, was a female slave and her three children. The two
                              eldest children were girls, the one about thirteen years of age, and the other
                              about eleven; the youngest was a boy. The whole family were exhibited together,
                              but they were sold separately, and to different purchasers. The farmers examined
                              them as if they had been so many head of cattle. While the sale was going on, the
                              mother and her children were exhibited on a table, that they might be seen by the
                              company, which was very large. There could not have been a finer subject for an
                              able painter than this unhappy group. The tears, the anxiety, the anguish of the
                              mother, while she met the gaze of the multitude, eyed the different countenances
                              of the bidders, or cast a heart-rending look upon the children; and the simplicity
                              and touching sorrow of the young ones, while they clung to their distracted
                              parent, wiping their eyes, and half concealing their faces,—contrasted with the
                              marked insensibility and jocular countenances of the spectators and
                              purchasers,—furnished a striking commentary on the miseries of slavery, and its
                              debasing effects upon the hearts of its abettors. While the woman was in this
                              distressed situation she was asked, ‘Can you feed sheep?’ Her reply was so
                              indistinct that it escaped me; but it was probably in the negative, for her
                              purchaser rejoined, in a loud and harsh voice, ‘Then I will teach you with the
                              sjamboc,’ (a whip made of the rhinoceros' hide.) The mother and her three children
                              were sold to three separate purchasers; and they were literally torn from each
                              other.”—

                           his son, a lad about my own age, Master Benjy, who took me to my new home. I did not
                           know where I was going, or what my new master would do with me. My heart was quite
                           broken with grief, and my thoughts went back continually to those from whom I had
                           been so suddenly parted. “Oh, my mother! my mother!” I kept saying to myself, “Oh,

                           most active woman I ever saw, and she was tasked to her utmost. A few minutes after
                           my arrival she came in from milking the cows, and put the sweet-potatoes on for
                           supper. She then fetched home the sheep, and penned them in the fold; drove home the

                           started up from his bed, and just as he was, in his shirt, ran down stairs with a

                           cracking of the thong, and the house rang to the shrieks of poor Hetty, who kept
                           crying out, “Oh, Massa! Massa! 
                           <unclear id="d14544e387" reason="damaged text"></unclear> dead. Massa! have
                           mercy upon me—don't kill me outright.”—This was a sad beginning for me. I sat up upon
                           my blanket, trembling with terror, like a frightened hound, and thinking that my turn
                           would come next. At length the house became still, and I forgot for a little while
                           all my sorrows by falling fast asleep.

                        <p id="d14544e390">The next morning my mistress set about instructing me in my tasks. She taught me to
                           do all sorts of household work; to wash and bake, pick cotton and wool, and wash
                           floors, and cook. And she taught me (how can I ever forget it!) more things than
                           these; she caused me to know the exact difference between the smart of the rope, the
                           cart-whip, and the cow-skin, when applied to my naked body by her own cruel hand.
                           And
                           there was scarcely any punishment more dreadful than the blows received on my face
                           and head from her hard heavy fist. She was a fearful woman, and a savage mistress
                           to
                           her slaves.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e393">There were two little slave boys in the house, on whom she vented her bad temper in
                           a
                           special manner. One of these children was a mulatto, called Cyrus, who had been
                           bought while an infant in his mother's arms; the other, Jack, was an African from
                           the
                           coast of Guinea, whom a sailor had given or sold to my master. Seldom a day passed
                           without <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="7"> </a></span> these boys receiving the most severe treatment, and
                           often for no fault at all. Both my master and mistress seemed to think that they had
                           a right to ill-use them at their pleasure; and very often accompanied their commands
                           with blows, whether the children were behaving well or ill. I have seen their flesh
                           ragged and raw with licks.—Lick—lick—they were never secure one moment from a blow,
                           and their lives were passed in continual fear. My mistress was not contented with
                           using the whip, but often pinched their cheeks and arms in the most cruel manner.
                           My
                           pity for these poor boys was soon transferred to myself; for I was licked, and
                           flogged, and pinched by her pitiless fingers in the neck and arms, exactly as they
                           were. To strip me naked—to hang me up by the wrists and lay my flesh open with the
                           cow-skin, was an ordinary punishment for even a slight offence. My mistress often
                           robbed me too of the hours that belong to sleep. She used to sit up very late,
                           frequently even until morning; and I had then to stand at a bench and wash during
                           the
                           greater part of the night, or pick wool and cotton; and often I have dropped down
                           overcome by sleep and fatigue, till roused from a state of stupor by the whip, and
                           forced to start up to my tasks.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e398">Poor Hetty, my fellow slave, was very kind to me, and I used to call her my Aunt;
                           but
                           she led a most miserable life, and her death was hastened (at least the slaves all
                           believed and said so,) by the dreadful chastisement she received from my master
                           during her pregnancy. It happened as follows. One of the cows had dragged the rope
                           away from the stake to which Hetty had fastened it, and got loose. My master flew
                           into a terrible passion, and ordered the poor creature to be stripped quite naked,
                           notwithstanding her pregnancy, and to be tied up to a tree in the yard. He then
                           flogged her as hard as he could lick, both with the whip and cow-skin, till she was
                           all over streaming with blood. He rested, and then beat her again and again. Her
                           shrieks were terrible. The consequence was that poor Hetty was brought to bed before
                           her time, and was delivered after severe labour of a dead child. She appeared to
                           recover after her confinement, so far that she was repeatedly flogged by both master
                           and mistress afterwards; but her former strength never returned to her. Ere long her
                           body and limbs swelled to a great size; and she lay on a mat in the kitchen, till
                           the
                           water burst out of her body and she died. All the slaves said that death was a good
                           thing for poor Hetty; but I cried very much for her death. The manner of it filled
                           me
                           with horror. I could not bear to think about it; yet it was always present to my mind
                           for many a day.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e402">After Hetty died all her labours fell upon me, in addition to my own. I had now to
                           milk eleven cows every morning before sunrise, sitting among the damp weeds; to take
                           care of the cattle as well as the children; and to do the work of the house. There
                           was no end to my toils—no end to my blows. I lay down at night and rose up in the
                           morning in fear and sorrow; and often wished that like poor Hetty I could escape from
                           this cruel bondage and be at rest in the grave. But the hand of that God whom then
                           I
                           knew not, was stretched over me; and I was mercifully preserved for better things.
                           It
                           was then, however, my heavy lot to weep, weep, weep, and that for years; to pass from
                           one <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="7" data-tei-n="8"> </a></span> misery to another, and from one cruel master to a worse.
                           But I must go on with the thread of my story.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e407">One day a heavy squall of wind and rain came on suddenly, and my mistress sent me
                           round the corner of the house to empty a large earthen jar. The jar was already
                           cracked with an old deep crack that divided it in the middle, and in turning it
                           upside down to empty it, it parted in my hand. I could not help the accident, but
                           I
                           was dreadfully frightened, looking forward to a severe punishment. I ran crying to
                           my
                           mistress, “O mistress, the jar has come in two.” “You have broken it, have you?” she
                           replied; “come directly here to me.” I came trembling: she stripped and flogged me
                           long and severely with the cow-skin; as long as she had strength to use the lash,
                           for
                           she did not give over till she was quite tired.—When my master came home at night,
                           she told him of my fault; and oh, frightful! how he fell a swearing. After abusing
                           me
                           with every ill name he could think of, (too, too bad to speak in England,) and giving
                           me several heavy blows with his hand, he said, “I shall come home to-morrow morning
                           at twelve, on purpose to give you a round hundred.” He kept his word—Oh sad for me!
                           I
                           cannot easily forget it. He tied me up upon a ladder, and gave me a hundred lashes
                           with his own hand, and master Benjy stood by to count them for him. When he had
                           licked me for some time he sat down to take breath; then after resting, he beat me
                           again and again, until he was quite wearied, and so hot (for the weather was very
                           sultry), that he sank back in his chair, almost like to faint. While my mistress went
                           to bring him drink, there was a dreadful earthquake. Part of the roof fell down, and
                           every thing in the house went—clatter, clatter, clatter. Oh I thought the end of all
                           things near at hand; and I was so sore with the flogging, that I scarcely cared
                           whether I lived or died. The earth was groaning and shaking; every thing tumbling
                           about; and my mistress and the slaves were shrieking and crying out, “The earthquake!
                           the earthquake!” It was an awful day for us all.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e410">During the confusion I crawled away on my hands and knees, and laid myself down under
                           the steps of the piazza, in front of the house. I was in a dreadful state—my body
                           all
                           blood and bruises, and I could not help moaning piteously. The other slaves, when
                           they saw me, shook their heads and said, “Poor child! poor child!”—I lay there till
                           the morning, careless of what might happen, for life was very weak in me, and I
                           wished more than ever to die. But when we are very young, death always seems a great
                           way off, and it would not come that night to me. The next morning I was forced by
                           my
                           master to rise and go about my usual work, though my body and limbs were so stiff
                           and
                           sore, that I could not move without the greatest pain.—Nevertheless, even after all
                           this severe punishment, I never heard the last of that jar; my mistress was always
                           throwing it in my face.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e413">Some little time after this, one of the cows got loose from the stake, and eat one
                           of
                           the

                           master found it out. He came to me, and without any more ado, stooped down, and
                           taking off his heavy boot, he struck me such a severe blow in the small of my back,
                           that I shrieked with agony, and thought I was killed; and I feel a weakness in that
                           part to this day. The cow was <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="8" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span> frightened at his violence, and
                           kicked down the pail and spilt the milk all about. My master knew that this accident
                           was his own fault, but he was so enraged that he seemed glad of an excuse to go on
                           with his ill usage. I cannot remember how many licks he gave me then, but he beat
                           me
                           till I was unable to stand, and till he himself was weary.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e423">After this I ran away and went to my mother, who was living with Mr. Richard Darrel.
                           My poor mother was both grieved and glad to see me; grieved because I had been so
                           ill
                           used, and glad because she had not seen me for a long, long while. She dared not
                           receive me into the house, but she hid me up in a hole in the rocks near, and brought
                           me food at night, after every body was asleep. My father, who lived at Crow-Lane,
                           over the salt-water channel, at last heard of my being hid up in the cavern, and he
                           came and took me back to my master. Oh I was loth, loth to go back; but as there was
                           no remedy, I was obliged to submit.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e426">When we got home, my poor father said to Capt. I——, “Sir, I am sorry that my child
                           should be forced to run away from her owner; but the treatment she has received is
                           enough to break her heart. The sight of her wounds has nearly broke mine.—I entreat
                           you, for the love of God, to forgive her for running away, and that you will be a
                           kind master to her in future.” Capt. I—— said I was used as well as I deserved, and
                           that I ought to be punished for running away. I then took courage and said that I
                           could stand the floggings no longer; that I was weary of my life, and therefore I
                           had
                           run away to my mother; but mothers could only weep and mourn over their children,
                           they could not save them from cruel masters—from the whip, the rope, and the cowskin.
                           He told me to hold my tongue and go about my work, or he would find a way to settle
                           me. He did not, however, flog me that day.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e430">For five years after this I remained in his house, and almost daily received the same
                           harsh treatment. At length he put me on board a sloop, and to my great joy sent me
                           away to Turk's Island. I was not permitted to see my mother or father, or poor
                           sisters and brothers, to say good bye, though going away to a strange land, and might
                           never see them again. Oh the Buckra people who keep slaves think that black people
                           are like cattle, without natural affection. But my heart tells me it is far
                           otherwise.

                        <p id="d14544e433">We were nearly four weeks on the voyage, which was unusually long. Sometimes we had
                           a
                           light breeze, sometimes a great calm, and the ship made no way; so that our
                           provisions and water ran very low, and we were put upon short allowance. I should
                           almost have been starved had it not been for the kindness of a black man called
                           Anthony, and his wife, who had brought their own victuals, and shared them with
                           me.

                        <p id="d14544e436">When we went ashore at the Grand Quay, the captain sent me to the house of my new
                           master, Mr. D——, to whom Captain I—— had sold me. Grand Quay is a small town upon
                           a
                           sandbank; the houses low and built of wood. Such was my new master's. The first
                           person I saw, on my arrival, was Mr. D——, a stout sulky looking man, who carried me
                           through the hall to show me to his wife and children. Next day I was put up by the
                           vendue master to know how much I was worth, and I was valued at one hundred pounds
                           currency.

                        <p id="d14544e441">My new master was one of the owners or holders of the salt ponds, and he received
                           a
                           certain sum for every slave that worked upon his premises, whether they were young
                           or
                           old. This sum was allowed him out of the profits arising from the salt works. I was
                           immediately sent to work in the salt water with the rest of the slaves. This work
                           was
                           perfectly new to me. I was given a half barrel and a shovel, and had to stand up to
                           my knees in the water, from four o'clock in the morning till nine, when we were given
                           some Indian corn boiled in water, which we were obliged to swallow as fast as we
                           could for fear the rain should come on and melt the salt. We were then called again
                           to our tasks, and worked through the heat of the day; the sun flaming upon our heads
                           like fire, and raising salt blisters in those parts which were not completely
                           covered. Our feet and legs, from standing in the salt water for so many hours, soon
                           became full of dreadful boils, which eat down in some cases to the very bone,
                           afflicting the sufferers with great torment. We came home at twelve; ate our corn
                           soup, called 
                           <hi id="d14544e443" style="font-style: italic;">blawly,</hi> as fast as we could, and went back to
                           our employment till dark at night. We then shovelled up the salt in large heaps, and
                           went down to the sea, where we washed the pickle from our limbs, and cleaned the
                           barrows and shovels from the salt. When we returned to the house, our master gave
                           us
                           each our allowance of raw Indian corn, which we pounded in a mortar and boiled in
                           water for our suppers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e447">We slept in a long shed, divided into narrow slips, like the stalls used for cattle.
                           Boards fixed upon stakes driven into the ground, without mat or covering, were our
                           only beds. On Sundays, after we had washed the salt bags, and done other work
                           required of us, we went into the bush and cut the long soft grass, of which we made
                           trusses for our legs and feet to rest upon, for they were so full of the salt boils
                           that we could get no rest lying upon the bare boards.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e451">Though we worked from morning till night, there was no satisfying Mr. D——. I hoped,
                           when I left Capt. I——, that I should have been better off, but I found it was but
                           going from one butcher to another. There was this difference between them: my former
                           master used to beat me while raging and foaming with passion; Mr. D—— was usually
                           quite calm. He would stand by and give orders for a slave to be cruelly whipped, and
                           assist in the punishment, without moving a muscle of his face; walking about and
                           taking snuff with the greatest composure. Nothing could touch his hard heart—neither
                           sighs, nor tears, nor prayers, nor streaming blood; he was deaf to our cries, and
                           careless of our sufferings.—Mr. D—— has often stripped me naked, hung me up by the
                           wrists, and beat me with the cow-skin, with his own hand, till my body was raw with
                           gashes. Yet there was nothing very remarkable in this; for it might serve as a sample
                           of the common usage of the slaves on that horrible island.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e454">Owing to the boils in my feet, I was unable to wheel the barrow fast through the
                           sand, which got into the sores, and made me stumble at every step; and my master,
                           having no pity for my sufferings from this cause, rendered them far more intolerable,
                           by chastising me for not being able to move so fast as he wished me. Another of our
                           employments was to row a little way off from the shore in a boat, and dive <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="11"> </a></span> for large stones to build a wall round our master's house.
                           This was very hard work; and the great waves breaking over us continually, made us
                           often so giddy that we lost our footing, and were in danger of being drowned.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e459">Ah, poor me!—my tasks were never ended. Sick or well, it was work—work—work!—After
                           the diving season was over, we were sent to the South Creek, with large bills, to
                           cut
                           up mangoes to burn lime with. Whilst one party of slaves were thus employed, another
                           were sent to the other side of the island to break up coral out of the sea.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e462">When we were ill, let our complaint be what it might, the only medicine given to us
                           was a great bowl of hot salt water, with salt mixed with it, which made us very sick.
                           If we could not keep up with the rest of the gang of slaves, we were put in the
                           stocks, and severely flogged the next morning. Yet, not the less, our master
                           expected, after we had thus been kept from our rest, and our limbs rendered stiff
                           and
                           sore with ill usage, that we should still go through the ordinary tasks of the day
                           all the same.—Sometimes we had to work all night, measuring salt to load a vessel;
                           or
                           turning a machine to draw water out of the sea for the salt-making. Then we had no
                           sleep—no rest—but were forced to work as fast as we could, and go on again all next
                           day the same as usual. Work—work—work—Oh that Turk's Island was a horrible place!
                           The
                           people in England, I am sure, have never found out what is carried on there. Cruel,
                           horrible place!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e465">Mr. D— had a slave called old Daniel, whom he used to treat in the most cruel manner.
                           Poor Daniel was lame in the hip, and could not keep up with the rest of the slaves;
                           and our master would order him to be stripped and laid down on the ground, and have
                           him beaten with a rod of rough briar till his skin was quite red and raw. He would
                           then call for a bucket of salt, and fling upon the raw flesh till the man writhed
                           on
                           the ground like a worm, and screamed aloud with agony. This poor man's wounds were
                           never healed, and I have often seen them full of maggots, which increased his
                           torments to an intolerable degree. He was an object of pity and terror to the whole
                           gang of slaves, and in his wretched case we saw, each of us, our own lot, if we
                           should live to be as old.

                        <p id="d14544e468">Oh the horrors of slavery!—How the thought of it pains my heart! But the truth ought
                           to be told of it; and what my eyes have seen I think it is my duty to relate; for
                           few
                           people in England know what slavery is. I have been a slave—I have felt what a slave
                           feels, and I know what a slave knows; and I would have all the good people in England
                           to know it too, that they may break our chains, and set us free.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e472">Mr. D—— had another slave called Ben. He being very hungry, stole a little rice one
                           night after he came in from work, and cooked it for his supper. But his master soon
                           discovered the theft: locked him up all night; and kept him without food till one
                           o'clock the next day. He then hung Ben up by his hands, and beat him from time to
                           time till the slaves came in at night. We found the poor creature hung up when we
                           came home; with a pool of blood beneath him, and our master still licking him. But
                           this was not the worst. My master's son was in the habit of stealing the rice and
                           rum. Ben had seen him do this, and thought he might do the same, and when master
                           found out that Ben <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span> had stolen the rice and swore to punish
                           him, he tried to excuse himself by saying that Master Dickey did the same thing every
                           night. The lad denied it to his father, and was so angry with Ben for informing
                           against him, that out of revenge he ran and got a bayonet, and whilst the poor wretch
                           was suspended by his hands and writhing under his wounds, he run it quite through
                           his
                           foot. I was not by when he did it, but I saw the wound when I came home, and heard
                           Ben tell the manner in which it was done.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e477">I must say something more about this cruel son of a cruel father.— He had no heart—no
                           fear of God; he had been brought up by a bad father in a bad path, and he delighted
                           to follow in the same steps. There was a little old woman among the slaves called
                           Sarah, who was nearly past work; and, Master Dickey being the overseer of the slaves
                           just then, this poor creature, who was subject to several bodily infirmities, and
                           was
                           not quite right in her head, did not wheel the barrow fast enough to please him. He
                           threw her down on the ground, and after beating her severely, he took her up in his
                           arms and flung her among the prickly-pear bushes, which are all covered over with
                           sharp venomous prickles. By this her naked flesh was so grievously wounded, that her
                           body swelled and festered all over, and she died a few days after. In telling my own
                           sorrows, I cannot pass by those of my fellow-slaves—for when I think of my own
                           griefs, I remember theirs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e480">I think it was about ten years I had worked in the salt ponds at Turk's Island, when
                           my master left off business, and retired to a house he had in Bermuda, leaving his
                           son to succeed him in the island. He took me with him to wait upon his daughters;
                           and
                           I was joyful, for I was sick, sick of Turk's Island, and my heart yearned to see my
                           native place again, my mother, and my kindred.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e483">I had seen my poor mother during the time I was a slave in Turk's Island. One Sunday
                           morning I was on the beach with some of the slaves, and we saw a sloop come in loaded
                           with slaves to work in the salt water. We got a boat and went aboard. When I came
                           upon the deck I asked the black people, “Is there any one here for me?” “Yes,” they
                           said, “your mother.” I thought they said this in jest—I could scarcely believe them
                           for joy; but when I saw my poor mammy my joy was turned to sorrow, for she had gone
                           from her senses. “Mammy,” I said, “is this you?” She did not know me. “Mammy,” I
                           said, “what's the matter?” She began to talk foolishly, and said that she had been
                           under the vessel's bottom. They had been overtaken by a violent storm at sea. My poor
                           mother had never been on the sea before, and she was so ill, that she lost her
                           senses, and it was long before she came quite to herself again. She had a sweet child
                           with her—a little sister I had never seen, about four years of age, called Rebecca.
                           I
                           took her on shore with me, for I felt I should love her directly; and I kept her with
                           me a week. Poor little thing! her's has been a sad life, and continues so to this
                           day. My mother worked for some years on the island, but was taken back to Bermuda
                           some time before my master carried me again thither.<a href="n7" class="ref-external" id="ref7">*</a></p>

                              father died while she and her mother were at Turk's Island; and that he had been
                              long dead and buried before any of his children in Bermuda knew of it, they being
                              slaves on other estates. Her mother died after Mary went to Antigua. Of the fate
                              of the rest of her kindred, seven brothers and three sisters, she knows nothing
                              further than this—that the eldest sister, who had several children to her master,
                              was taken by him to Trinidad; and that the youngest, Rebecca, is still alive, and
                              in slavery in Bermuda. Mary herself is now about forty-three years of age.—

                        <p id="d14544e501">After I left Turk's Island, I was told by some negroes that came over from it, that
                           the poor slaves had built up a place with boughs and leaves, where they might meet
                           for prayers, but the white people pulled it down twice, and would not allow them even
                           a shed for prayers. A flood came down soon after and washed away many houses, filled
                           the place with sand, and overflowed the ponds: and I do think that this was for their
                           wickedness; for the Buckra men<a href="n8" class="ref-external" id="ref8">*</a><a class="note-marker" href="#d14544e505">09</a><note data-tapas-note-num="09" id="n8" anchored="true" target="ref8">

                           were very wicked. I saw and heard much that was very very bad at that place.

                        <p id="d14544e510">I was several years the slave of Mr. D—— after I returned to my native place. Here
                           I
                           worked in the grounds. My work was planting and hoeing sweet-potatoes, Indian corn,
                           
                           <sic id="d14544e513">plaintains,</sic> bananas, cabbages,
                           pumpkins, onions, &amp;c. I did all the household work, and attended upon a horse and
                           cow besides,—going also upon all errands. I had to curry the horse—to clean and feed
                           him—and sometimes to ride him a little. I had more than enough to do—but still it
                           was
                           not so very bad as Turk's Island.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e517">My old master often got drunk, and then he would get in a fury with his daughter,
                           and
                           beat her till she was not fit to be seen. I remember on one occasion, I had gone to
                           fetch water, and when I was coming up the hill I heard a great screaming; I ran as
                           fast as I could to the house, put down the water, and went into the chamber, where
                           I
                           found my master beating Miss D—— dreadfully. I strove with all my strength to get
                           her
                           away from him; for she was all black and blue with bruises. He had beat her with his
                           fist, and almost killed her. The people gave me credit for getting her away. He
                           turned round and began to lick me. Then I said, “Sir, this is not Turk's Island.”
                           I
                           can't repeat his answer, the words were too wicked—too bad to say. He wanted to treat
                           me the same in Bermuda as he had done in Turk's Island.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e520">He had an ugly fashion of stripping himself quite naked, and ordering me then to wash
                           him in a tub of water. This was worse to me than all the licks. Sometimes when he
                           called me to wash him I would not come, my eyes were so full of shame. He would then
                           come to beat me. One time I had plates and knives in my hand, and I dropped both
                           plates and knives, and some of the plates were broken. He struck me so severely for
                           this, that at last I defended myself, for I thought it was high time to do so. I then
                           told him I would not live longer with him, for he was a very indecent man—very
                           spiteful, and too indecent; with no shame for his servants, no shame for his own
                           flesh. So I went away to a neighbouring house and sat down and cried till the next
                           morning, when I went home again, not knowing what else to do.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e523">After that I was hired to work at Cedar Hills, and every Saturday night I paid the
                           money to my master. I had plenty of work to do there— <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="14"> </a></span>
                           plenty of washing; but yet I made myself pretty comfortable. I earned two dollars
                           and
                           a quarter a week, which is twenty pence a day.

                        <p id="d14544e528">During the time I worked there, I heard that Mr. John Wood was going to Antigua. I
                           felt a great wish to go there, and I went to Mr. D——, and asked him to let me go in
                           Mr. Wood's service. Mr. Wood did not then want to purchase me; it was my own fault
                           that I came under him, I was so anxious to go. It was ordained to be, I suppose; God
                           led me there. The truth is, I did not wish to be any longer the slave of my indecent
                           master.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e532">Mr. Wood took me with him to Antigua, to the town of St. John's, where he lived. This
                           was about fifteen years ago. He did not then know whether I was to be sold; but Mrs.
                           Wood found that I could work, and she wanted to buy me. Her husband then wrote to
                           my
                           master to inquire whether I was to be sold? Mr. D— wrote in reply, “that I should
                           not
                           be sold to any one that would treat me ill.” It was strange he should say this, when
                           he had treated me so ill himself. So I was purchased by Mr. Wood for 300 dollars,

                        <p id="d14544e543">My work there was to attend the chambers and nurse the child, and to go down to the
                           pond and wash clothes. But I soon fell ill of the rheumatism, and grew so very lame
                           that I was forced to walk with a stick. I got the Saint Anthony's fire, also, in my
                           left leg, and became quite a cripple. No one cared much to come near me, and I was
                           ill a long long time; for several months I could not lift the limb. I had to lie in
                           a
                           little old out-house, that was swarming with bugs and other vermin, which tormented
                           me greatly; but I had no other place to lie in. I got the rheumatism by catching cold
                           at the pond side, from washing in the fresh water; in the salt water I never got
                           cold. The person who lived in next yard, (a Mrs. Greene,) could not bear to hear my
                           cries and groans. She was kind, and used to send an old slave woman to help me, who
                           sometimes brought me a little soup. When the doctor found I was so ill, he said I
                           must be put into a bath of hot water. The old slave got the bark of some bush that
                           was good for the pains, which she boiled in the hot water, and every night she came
                           and put me into the bath, and did what she could for me: I don't know what I should
                           have done, or what would have become of me, had it not been for her.—My mistress,
                           it
                           is true, did send me a little food; but no one from our family came near me but the
                           cook, who used to shove my food in at the door, and say, “Molly, Molly, there's your
                           dinner.” My mistress did not care to take any trouble about me; and if the Lord had
                           not put it into the hearts of the neighbours to be kind to me, I must, I really
                           think, have lain and died.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e546">It was a long time before I got well enough to work in the house. Mrs. Wood, in the
                           meanwhile, hired a mulatto woman to nurse the child; but she was such a fine lady
                           she
                           wanted to be mistress over me. I thought it very hard for a coloured woman to have
                           rule over me because I was a slave and she was free. Her name was Martha Wilcox; she
                           was a saucy woman, very saucy; and she went and complained of <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="14" data-tei-n="15"> </a></span> me, without cause, to my mistress, and made her angry with me. Mrs. Wood told me
                           that if I did not mind what I was about, she would get my master to strip me and give
                           me fifty lashes: “You have been used to the whip,” she said, “and you shall have it
                           here.” This was the first time she threatened to have me flogged; and she gave me
                           the
                           threatening so strong of what she would have done to me, that I thought I should have
                           fallen down at her feet, I was so vexed and hurt by her words. The mulatto woman was
                           rejoiced to have power to keep me down. She was constantly making mischief; there
                           was
                           no living for the slaves—no peace after she came.

                        <p id="d14544e551">I was also sent by Mrs. Wood to be put in the Cage one night, and was next morning
                           flogged, by the magistrate's order, at her desire; and this all for a quarrel I had
                           about a pig with another slave woman. I was flogged on my naked back on this
                           occasion: although I was in no fault after all; for old Justice Dyett, when we came
                           before him, said that I was in the right, and ordered the pig to be given to me. This
                           was about two or three years after I came to Antigua.

                        <p id="d14544e554">When we moved from the middle of the town to the Point, I used to be in the house
                           and
                           do all the work and mind the children, though still very ill with the rheumatism.
                           Every week I had to wash two large bundles of clothes, as much as a boy could help
                           me
                           to lift; but I could give no satisfaction. My mistress was always abusing and
                           fretting after me. It is not possible to tell all her ill language.—One day she
                           followed me foot after foot scolding and rating me. I bore in silence a great deal
                           of
                           ill words: at last my heart was quite full, and I told her that she ought not to use
                           me so;—that when I was ill I might have lain and died for what she cared; and no one
                           would then come near me to nurse me, because they were afraid of my mistress. This
                           was a great affront. She called her husband and told him what I had said. He flew
                           into a passion: but did not beat me then; he only abused and swore at me; and then
                           gave me a note and bade me go and look for an owner. Not that he meant to sell me;
                           but he did this to please his wife and to frighten me. I went to Adam White, a
                           cooper, a free black, who had money, and asked him to buy me. He went directly to
                           Mr.
                           Wood, but was informed that I was not to be sold. The next day my master whipped
                           me.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e558">Another time (about five years ago) my mistress got vexed with me, because I fell
                           sick and I could not keep on with my work. She complained to her husband, and he sent
                           me off again to look for an owner. I went to a Mr. Burchell, showed him the note,
                           and
                           asked him to buy me for my own benefit; for I had saved about 100 dollars, and hoped,
                           with a little help, to purchase my freedom. He accordingly went to my master:—“Mr.
                           Wood,” he said, “Molly has brought me a note that she wants an owner. If you intend
                           to sell her, I may as well buy her as another.” My master put him off and said that
                           he did not mean to sell me. I was very sorry at this, for I had no comfort with Mrs.
                           Wood, and I wished greatly to get my freedom.

                        <p id="d14544e561">The way in which I made my money was this.—When my master and mistress went from
                           home, as they sometimes did, and left me to take care of the house and premises, I
                           had a good deal of time to myself, and made the most of it. I took in washing, and
                           sold coffee and yams <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span> and other provisions to the captains
                           of ships. I did not sit still idling during the absence of my owners; for I wanted,
                           by all honest means, to earn money to buy my freedom. Sometimes I bought a hog cheap
                           on board ship, and sold it for double the money on shore; and I also earned a good
                           deal by selling coffee. By this means I by degrees acquired a little cash. A
                           gentleman also lent me some to help to buy my freedom—but when I could not get free
                           he got it back again. His name was Captain Abbot.

                        <p id="d14544e566">My master and mistress went on one occasion into the country, to Date Hill, for
                           change of air, and carried me with them to take charge of the children, and to do
                           the
                           work of the house. While I was in the country, I saw how the field negroes are worked
                           in Antigua. They are worked very hard and fed but scantily. They are called out to
                           work before daybreak, and come home after dark; and then each has to heave his bundle
                           of grass for the cattle in the pen. Then, on Sunday morning, each slave has to go
                           out
                           and gather a large bundle of grass; and, when they bring it home, they have all to
                           sit at the manager's door and wait till he come out: often have they to wait there
                           till past eleven o'clock, without any breakfast. After that, those that have yams
                           or
                           potatoes, or fire-wood to sell, hasten to market to buy a dog's worth <a href="n10" class="ref-external" id="ref10">*</a><a class="note-marker" href="#d14544e570">11</a><note data-tapas-note-num="11" id="n10" anchored="true" target="ref10">

                           shad barrels, which they call sauce, to season their yams and Indian corn. It is very
                           wrong, I know, to work on Sunday or go to market; but will not God call the Buckra

                           the place (which then belonged to Mr. Roberts the marshal), asked me to go with her
                           to her husband's house, to a Methodist meeting for prayer, at a plantation called
                           Winthorps. I went; and they were the first prayers I ever understood. One woman
                           prayed; and then they all sung a hymn; then there was another prayer and another
                           hymn; and then they all spoke by turns of their own griefs as sinners. The husband
                           of
                           the woman I went with was a black driver. His name was Henry. He confessed that he
                           had treated the slaves very cruelly; but said that he was compelled to obey the
                           orders of his master. He prayed them all to forgive him, and he prayed that God would
                           forgive him. He said it was a horrid thing for a ranger<a href="n11" class="ref-external" id="ref11">**</a><a class="note-marker" href="#d14544e579">12</a><note data-tapas-note-num="12" id="n11" anchored="true" target="ref11">

                           and led my spirit to the Moravian church; so that when I got back to town, I went
                           and
                           prayed to have my name put down in the Missionaries' book; and I followed the church
                           earnestly every opportunity. I did not then tell my mistress about it; for I knew
                           that she would not give me leave to go. But I felt I

                        <p id="d14544e592">The Moravian ladies (Mrs. Richter, Mrs. Olufsen, and Mrs. Sauter) taught me to read
                           in the class; and I got on very fast. In this class there were all sorts of people,
                           old and young, grey headed folks and children; but most of them were free people.
                           After we had done spelling, we tried to read in the Bible. After the reading was
                           over, the missionary gave out a hymn for us to sing. I dearly loved to go to the
                           church, it was so solemn. I never knew rightly that I had much sin till I went there.
                           When I found out that I was a great sinner, I was very sorely grieved, and very much
                           frightened. I used to pray God to pardon my sins for Christ's sake, and forgive me
                           for every thing I had done amiss; and when I went home to my work, I always thought
                           about what I had heard from the missionaries, and wished to be good that I might go
                           to heaven. After a while I was admitted a candidate for the holy Communion.—I had
                           been baptized long before this, in the year 1817, by the Rev. Mr. Curtin, of the
                           English Church, after I had been taught to repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer.
                           I
                           wished at that time to attend a Sunday School taught by Mr. Curtin, but he would not
                           receive me without a written note from my master, granting his permission. I did not
                           ask my owner's permission, from the belief that it would be refused; so that I got
                           no

                              to her by the Rev. Mr. Curtin, and dated August 30, 1817. In this book her name is
                              written “Mary, Princess of Wales”—an appellation which, she says, was given her by
                              her owners. It is a common practice with the colonists to give ridiculous names of
                              this description to their slaves; being, in fact, one of the numberless modes of
                              expressing the habitual contempt with which they regard the negro race.—In
                              printing this narrative we have retained Mary's paternal name of Prince.—

                        <p id="d14544e606">Some time after I began to attend the Moravian Church, I met with Daniel James,
                           afterwards my dear husband. He was a carpenter and cooper to his trade; an honest,
                           hard-working, decent black man, and a widower. He had purchased his freedom of his
                           mistress, old Mrs. Baker, with money he had earned whilst a slave. When he asked me
                           to marry him, I took time to consider the matter over with myself, and would not say
                           yes till he went to church with me and joined the Moravians. He was very industrious
                           after he bought his freedom; and he had hired a comfortable house, and had convenient
                           things about him. We were joined in marriage, about Christmas 1826, in the Moravian
                           Chapel at Spring Gardens, by the Rev. Mr. Olufsen. We could not be married in the
                           English Church. English marriage is not allowed to slaves; and no free man can marry
                           a slave woman.

                        <p id="d14544e609">When Mr. Wood heard of my marriage, he flew into a great rage, and sent for Daniel,
                           who was helping to build a house for his old mistress. Mr. Wood asked him who gave
                           him a right to marry a slave of his? My husband said, “Sir, I am a free man, and
                           thought I had a right to choose a wife; but if I had known Molly was not allowed to
                           have a husband, I should not have asked her to marry me.” Mrs. Wood was more vexed
                           about my marriage than her husband. She could not forgive <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="17" data-tei-n="18"> </a></span>

                           to be whipped at my time of life for getting a husband—I told her so. She said that
                           she would not have nigger men about the yards and premises, or allow a nigger man's
                           clothes to be washed in the same tub where hers were washed. She was fearful, I
                           think, that I should lose her time, in order to wash and do things for my husband:
                           but I had then no time to wash for myself; I was obliged to put out my own clothes,
                           though I was always at the wash-tub.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e617">I had not much happiness in my marriage, owing to my being a slave. It made my
                           husband sad to see me so ill-treated. Mrs. Wood was always abusing me about him. She
                           did not lick me herself, but she got her husband to do it for her, whilst she fretted
                           the flesh off my bones. Yet for all this she would not sell me. She sold five slaves
                           whilst I was with her; but though she was always finding fault with me, she would
                           not
                           part with me. However, Mr. Wood afterwards allowed Daniel to have a place to live
                           in
                           our yard, which we were very thankful for.

                        <p id="d14544e620">After this, I fell ill again with the rheumatism, and was sick a long time; but
                           whether sick or well, I had my work to do. About this time I asked my master and
                           mistress to let me buy my own freedom. With the help of Mr. Burchell, I could have
                           found the means to pay Mr. Wood; for it was agreed that I should afterwards serve
                           Mr.
                           Burchell a while, for the cash he was to advance for me. I was earnest in the request
                           to my owners; but their hearts were hard—too hard to consent. Mrs. Wood was very
                           angry—she grew quite outrageous—she called me a black devil, and asked me who had
                           put
                           freedom into my head. “To be free is very sweet,” I said: but she took good care to
                           keep me a slave. I saw her change colour, and I left the room.

                        <p id="d14544e623">About this time my master and mistress were going to England to put their son to
                           school, and bring their daughters home; and they took me with them to take care of
                           the child. I was willing to come to England: I thought that by going there I should
                           probably get cured of my rheumatism, and should return with my master and mistress,
                           quite well, to my husband. My husband was willing for me to come away, for he had
                           heard that my master would free me,—and I also hoped this might prove true; but it
                           was all a false report.

                        <p id="d14544e627">The steward of the ship was very kind to me. He and my husband were in the same class
                           in the Moravian Church. I was thankful that he was so friendly, for my mistress was
                           not kind to me on the passage; and she told me, when she was angry, that she did not
                           intend to treat me any better in England than in the West Indies—that I need not
                           expect it. And she was as good as her word.

                        <p id="d14544e630">When we drew near to 
                           <placeName id="d14544e632">England</placeName>, the rheumatism seized all my
                           limbs worse than ever, and my body was dreadfully swelled. When we landed at the
                           Tower, I shewed my flesh to my mistress, but she took no great notice of it. We were
                           obliged to stop at the tavern till my master got a house; and a day or two after,
                           my
                           mistress sent me down into the wash-house to learn to wash in the English way. In
                           the
                           West Indies we wash with cold water—in England with hot. I told my mistress I was
                           afraid that putting my hands first into the hot water and then <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="19"> </a></span> into the cold, would increase the pain in my limbs. The doctor had told
                           my mistress long before I came from the West Indies, that I was a sickly body and
                           the
                           washing did not agree with me. But Mrs. Wood would not release me from the tub, so
                           I
                           was forced to do as I could. I grew worse, and could not stand to wash. I was then
                           forced to sit down with the tub before me, and often through pain and weakness was
                           reduced to kneel or to sit down on the floor, to finish my task. When I complained
                           to
                           my mistress of this, she only got into a passion as usual, and said washing in hot
                           water could not hurt any one;—that I was lazy and insolent, and wanted to be free
                           of
                           my work; but that she would make me do it. I thought her very hard on me, and my
                           heart rose up within me. However I kept still at that time, and went down again to
                           wash the child's things; but the English washerwomen who were at work there, when
                           they saw that I was so ill, had pity upon me and washed them for me.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e638">After that, when we came up to live in Leigh Street, Mrs. Wood sorted out five bags
                           of clothes which we had used at sea, and also such as had been worn since we came
                           on
                           shore, for me and the cook to wash. Elizabeth the cook told her, that she did not
                           think that I was able to stand to the tub, and that she had better hire a woman. I
                           also said myself, that I had come over to nurse the child, and that I was sorry I
                           had
                           come from Antigua, since mistress would work me so hard, without compassion for my
                           rheumatism. Mr. and Mrs. Wood, when they heard this, rose up in a passion against
                           me.
                           They opened the door and bade me get out. But I was a stranger, and did not know one
                           door in the street from another, and was unwilling to go away. They made a dreadful
                           uproar, and from that day they constantly kept cursing and abusing me. I was obliged
                           to wash, though I was very ill. Mrs. Wood, indeed once hired a washerwoman, but she
                           was not well treated, and would come no more.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e641">My master quarrelled with me another time, about one of our great washings, his wife
                           having stirred him up to do so. He said he would compel me to do the whole of the
                           washing given out to me, or if I again refused, he would take a short course with
                           me:
                           he would either send me down to the brig in the river, to carry me back to Antigua,
                           or he would turn me at once out of doors, and let me provide for myself. I said I
                           would willingly go back, if he would let me purchase my own freedom. But this enraged
                           him more than all the rest: he cursed and swore at me dreadfully, and said he would
                           never sell my freedom—if I wished to be free, I was free in England, and I might go
                           and try what freedom would do for me, and be d——d. My heart was very sore with this
                           treatment, but I had to go on. I continued to do my work, and did all I could to give
                           satisfaction, but all would not do.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e644">Shortly after, the cook left them, and then matters went on ten times worse. I always
                           washed the child's clothes without being commanded to do it, and any thing else that
                           was wanted in the family; though still I was very sick—very sick indeed. When the
                           great washing came round, which was every two months, my mistress got together again
                           a great many heavy things, such as bed-ticks, bed-coverlets, &amp;c. for me to wash.
                           I told her I was too ill to wash such heavy things that day. <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span> She said, she supposed I thought myself a free woman, but I was not: and if I did
                           not do it directly I should be instantly turned out of doors. I stood a long time
                           before I could answer, for I did not know well what to do. I knew that I was free
                           in
                           England, but I did not know where to go, or how to get my living; and therefore, I
                           did not like to leave the house. But Mr. Wood said he would send for a constable to
                           thrust me out; and at last I took courage and resolved that I would not be longer
                           thus treated, but would go and trust to Providence. This was the fourth time they
                           had
                           threatened to turn me out, and, go where I might, I was determined now to take them
                           at their word; though I thought it very hard, after I had lived with them for
                           thirteen years, and worked for them like a horse, to be driven out in this way, like
                           a beggar. My only fault was being sick, and therefore unable to please my mistress,
                           who thought she never could get work enough out of her slaves; and I told them so:
                           but they only abused me and drove me out. This took place from two to three months,
                           I
                           think, after we came to England.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e649">When I came away, I went to the man (one Mash) who used to black the shoes of the
                           family, and asked his wife to get somebody to go with me to Hatton Garden to the
                           Moravian Missionaries: these were the only persons I knew in England. The woman sent
                           a young girl with me to the mission house, and I saw there a gentleman called Mr.
                           Moore. I told him my whole story, and how my owners had treated me, and asked him
                           to
                           take in my trunk with what few clothes I had. The missionaries were very kind to
                           me—they were sorry for my destitute situation, and gave me leave to bring my things
                           to be placed under their care. They were very good people, and they told me to come
                           to the church.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e653">When I went back to Mr. Wood's to get my trunk, I saw a lady, Mrs. Pell, who was on
                           a
                           visit to my mistress. When Mr. and Mrs. Wood heard me come in, they set this lady
                           to
                           stop me, finding that they had gone too far with me. Mrs. Pell came out to me, and
                           said, “Are you really going to leave, Molly? Don't leave, but come into the country
                           with me.” I believe she said this because she thought Mrs. Wood would easily get me
                           back again. I replied to her, “Ma'am, this is the fourth time my master and mistress
                           have driven me out, or threatened to drive me—and I will give them no more occasion
                           to bid me go. I was not willing to leave them, for I am a stranger in this country,
                           but now I must go—I can stay no longer to be so used.” Mrs. Pell then went up stairs
                           to my mistress, and told that I would go, and that she could not stop me. Mrs. Wood
                           was very much hurt and frightened when she found I was determined to go out that day.
                           She said, “If she goes the people will rob her, and then turn her adrift.” She did
                           not say this to me, but she spoke it loud enough for me to hear; that it might induce
                           me not to go, I suppose. Mr. Wood also asked me where I was going to. I told him
                           where I had been, and that I should never have gone away had I not been driven out
                           by
                           my owners. He had given me a written paper some time before, which said that I had
                           come with them to England by my own desire; and that was true. It said also that I
                           left them of my own free will, because I was a free woman in England; and that <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="20" data-tei-n="21"> </a></span> I was idle and would not do my work—which was not true. I
                           gave this paper afterwards to a gentleman who inquired into my case.<a href="n13" class="ref-external" id="ref13">*</a></p>

                        <p id="d14544e666">I went into the kitchen and got my clothes out. The nurse and the servant girl were
                           there, and I said to the man who was going to take out my trunk, “Stop, before you
                           take up this trunk, and hear what I have to say before these people. I am going out
                           of this house, as I was ordered; but I have done no wrong at all to my owners,
                           neither here nor in the West Indies. I always worked very hard to please them, both
                           by night and day; but there was no giving satisfaction, for my mistress could never
                           be satisfied with reasonable service. I told my mistress I was sick, and yet she has
                           ordered me out of doors. This is the fourth time; and now I am going out.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e669">And so I came out, and went and carried my trunk to the Moravians. I then returned
                           back to Mash the shoe-black's house, and begged his wife to take me in. I had a
                           little West Indian money in my trunk; and they got it changed for me. This helped
                           to
                           support me for a little while. The man's wife was very kind to me. I was very sick,
                           and she boiled nourishing things up for me. She also sent for a doctor to see me,
                           and
                           he sent me medicine, which did me good, though I was ill for a long time with the
                           rheumatic pains. I lived a good many months with these poor people, and they nursed
                           me, and did all that lay in their power to serve me. The man was well acquainted with
                           my situation, as he used to go to and fro to Mr. Wood's house to clean shoes and
                           knives; and he and his wife were sorry for me.

                           and
                           went with me to their office, to inquire if they could do any thing to get me my
                           freedom, and send me back to the West Indies. The gentlemen of the Society took me
                           to
                           a lawyer, who examined very strictly into my case; but told me that the laws of

                           gave me a little money from time to time to keep me from want; and some of them went
                           to Mr. Wood to try to persuade him to let me return a free woman to my husband; but
                           though they offered him, as I have heard, a large sum for my freedom, he was sulky
                           and obstinate, and would not consent to let me go free.

                           Providence was very good to me, and I got many friends—especially some Quaker ladies,
                           who hearing of my case, came and sought me out, and gave me good warm clothing and
                           money. Thus I had great cause to bless God in my affliction.

                        <p id="d14544e701">After Mrs. Forsyth went away, I was again out of place, and went to lodgings, for
                           which I paid two shillings a week, and found coals and candle. After eleven weeks,
                           the money I had saved in service was all gone, and I was forced to go back to the
                           Anti-Slavery office to ask a supply, till I could get another situation. I did not
                           like to go back—I did not like to be idle. I would rather work for my living than
                           get
                           it for nothing. They were very good to give me a supply, but I felt shame at being
                           obliged to apply for relief whilst I had strength to work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e704">At last I went into the service of Mr. and Mrs. Pringle, where I have been ever
                           since, and am as comfortable as I can be while separated from my dear husband, and
                           away from my own country and all old friends and connections. My dear mistress
                           teaches me daily to read the word of God, and takes great pains to make me understand
                           it. I enjoy the great privilege of being enabled to attend church three times on the
                           Sunday: and I have met with many kind friends since I have been here, both clergymen
                           and others. The Rev. Mr. Young, who lives in the next house, has shown me much
                           kindness, and taken much pains to instruct me, particularly while my master and
                           mistress were absent in Scotland. Nor must I forget, among my friends, the Rev. Mr.
                           Mortimer, the good clergyman of the parish, under whose ministry I have now sat for
                           upwards of twelve months. I trust in God I have profited by what I have heard from
                           him. He never keeps back the truth, and I think he has been the means of opening my
                           eyes and ears much better to understand the word of God. Mr. Mortimer tells me that
                           he cannot open the eyes of my heart, but that I must pray to God to change my heart,
                           and make me to know the truth, and the truth will make me free.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e707">I still live in the hope that God will find a way to give me my liberty, and give
                           me
                           back to my husband. I endeavour to keep down my fretting, and to leave all to Him,
                           for he knows what is good for me better than I know myself. Yet, I must confess, I
                           find it a hard and heavy task to do so.

                           their back? and are disgraced and thought no more of than beasts?—and are separated
                           from their mothers, and husbands, and children, and sisters, just as cattle are sold
                           and separated? Is it happiness for a driver in the field to take down his wife or
                           sister or child, and strip them, and whip them in such a disgraceful manner?—women
                           that have had children exposed in the open field to shame! There is no modesty or
                           decency shown by the owner to his slaves; men, women, and children are exposed alike.
                           Since I have been here I have often wondered how English people can go out into the
                           West Indies and act in such a beastly manner. But when they go to the West Indies,
                           they forget God and all feeling of shame, I think, since they can see and do such
                           things. They tie up slaves like hogs—moor<a href="n18" class="ref-external" id="ref18">*</a><a class="note-marker" href="#d14544e729">19</a><note data-tapas-note-num="19" id="n18" anchored="true" target="ref18">

                           them, so as hogs, or cattle, or horses never were flogged;—and yet they come home
                           and
                           say, and make some good people believe, that slaves don't want to get out of slavery.
                           But they put a cloak about the truth. It is not so. All slaves want to be free—to
                           be
                           free is very sweet. I will say the truth to English people who may read this history
                           that my good friend, Miss S——, is now writing down for me. I have been a slave
                           myself—I know what slaves feel—I can tell by myself what other slaves feel, and by
                           what they have told me. The man that says slaves be quite happy in slavery—that they
                           don't want to be free—that man is either ignorant or a lying person. I never heard
                           a
                           slave say so. I never heard a Buckra man say so, till I heard tell of it in England.
                           Such people ought to be ashamed of themselves. They can't do without slaves, they
                           say. What's the reason they can't do without slaves as well as in England? No slaves
                           here—no whips—no stocks—no punishment, except for wicked people. They hire servants
                           in England; and if they don't like them, they send them away: they can't lick them.
                           Let them work ever so hard in England, they are far better off than slaves. If they
                           get a bad master, they give warning and go hire to another. They have their liberty.
                           That's just what 
                           <hi id="d14544e734" style="font-style: italic;">we</hi> want. We don't mind hard work, if we had
                           proper treatment, and proper wages like English servants, and proper time given in
                           the week to keep us from breaking the Sabbath. But they won't give it: they will have
                           work—work—work, night and day, sick or well, till we are quite done up; and we must
                           not speak up nor look amiss, however much we be abused. And then when we are quite
                           done up, who cares for us, more than for a lame horse? This is slavery. I tell it,
                           to
                           let English people know the truth; and I hope they will never leave off to pray God,
                           and call loud to the great King of England, till all the poor blacks be given free,
                           and slavery done up for evermore.

                        <p id="d14544e753">LEAVING Mary's narrative, for the present, without comment to the reader's
                           reflections, I proceed to state some circumstances connected with her case which have
                           fallen more particularly under my own notice, and which I consider it incumbent now
                           to lay fully before the public.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e756">About the latter end of November, 1828, this poor woman found her way to the office
                           of the Anti-Slavery Society in Aldermanbury, by the aid of a person who had become
                           acquainted with her situation, and had advised her to apply there for advice and
                           assistance. After some preliminary examination into the accuracy of the circumstances
                           related by her, I went along with her to Mr. George Stephen, solicitor, and requested
                           him to investigate and draw up a statement of her case, and have it submitted to
                           counsel, in order to ascertain whether or not, under the circumstances, her freedom
                           could be legally established on her return to Antigua. On this occasion, in Mr.
                           Stephen's presence and mine, she expressed, in very strong terms, her anxiety to
                           return thither if she could go as a free person, and, at the same time, her extreme
                           apprehensions of the fate that would probably await her if she returned as a slave.
                           Her words were, “I would rather go into my grave than go back a slave to Antigua,
                           though I wish to go back to my husband very much—very much—very much! I am much
                           afraid my owners would separate me from my husband, and use me very hard, or perhaps
                           sell me for a field negro;—and slavery is too too bad. I would rather go into my
                           grave!”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e760">The paper which Mr. Wood had given her before she left his house, was placed by her
                           in Mr. Stephen's hands. It was expressed in the following terms:—
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e763">“I have already told Molly, and now give it her in writing, in order that there may
                           be no misunderstanding on her part, that as I brought her from Antigua at her own
                           request and entreaty, and that she is consequently now free, she is of course at
                           liberty to take her baggage and go where she pleases. And, in consequence of her late
                           conduct, she must do one of two things—either quit the house, or return to Antigua
                           by
                           the earliest opportunity, as she does not evince a disposition to make herself
                           useful. As she is a stranger in London, I do not wish to turn <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="25"> </a></span> her out, or would do so, as two female servants are sufficient for my
                           establishment. If after this she does remain, it will be only during her good
                           behaviour: but on no consideration will I allow her wages or any other remuneration
                           for her services. “JOHN A. WOOD.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e768">“London, August 18, 1828.”</p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e771">This paper, though not devoid of inconsistencies, which will be apparent to any
                           attentive reader, is craftily expressed; and was well devised to serve the purpose
                           which the writer had obviously in view, namely, to frustrate any appeal which the
                           friendless black woman might make to the sympathy of strangers, and thus prevent her
                           from obtaining an asylum, if she left his house, from any respectable family. As she
                           had no one to refer to for a character in this country except himself, he doubtless
                           calculated securely on her being speedily driven back, as soon as the slender fund
                           she had in her possession was expended, to throw herself unconditionally upon his
                           tender mercies; and his disappointment in this expectation appears to have
                           exasperated his feelings of resentment towards the poor woman, to a degree which few
                           persons alive to the claims of common justice, not to speak of christianity or common
                           humanity, could easily have anticipated. Such, at least, seems the only intelligible
                           inference that can be drawn from his subsequent conduct.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e774">The case having been submitted, by desire of the Anti-Slavery Committee, to the
                           consideration of Dr. Lushington and Mr. Sergeant Stephen, it was found that there
                           existed no legal means of compelling Mary's master to grant her manumission; and that
                           if she returned to Antigua, she would inevitably fall again under his power, or that
                           of his attorneys, as a slave. It was, however, resolved to try what could be effected
                           for her by amicable negotiation; and with this view Mr. Ravenscroft, a solicitor,
                           (Mr. G. Stephen's relative,) called upon Mr. Wood, in order to ascertain whether he
                           would consent to Mary's manumission on any reasonable terms, and to refer, if
                           required, the amount of compensation for her value to arbitration. Mr. Ravenscroft
                           with some difficulty obtained one or two interviews, but found Mr. Wood so full of
                           animosity against the woman, and so firmly bent against any arrangement having her
                           freedom for its object, that the negotiation was soon broken off as hopeless. The
                           angry slave-owner declared “that he would not move a finger about her in this
                           country, or grant her manumission on any terms whatever; and that if she went back
                           to
                           the West Indies, she must take the consequences.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d14544e777">This unreasonable conduct of Mr. Wood, induced the Anti-Slavery Committee, after
                           several other abortive attempts to effect a compromise, to think of bringing the case
                           under the notice of Parliament. The heads of Mary's statement were accordingly
                           engrossed in a Petition, which Dr. Lushington offered to present, and to give notice
                           at the same time of his intention to bring in a Bill to provide for the entire
                           emancipation of all slaves brought to England with the owner's consent. But before
                           this step was taken, Dr. Lushington again had recourse to 
                           <sic id="d14544e779">

                           </sic> with the master; and, partly through the
                           friendly intervention of Mr Manning, partly by personal conference, used every
                           persuasion in his power to induce Mr. Wood to relent and let the bondwoman go free.
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="25" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span> Seeing the matter thus seriously taken up, Mr. Wood
                           became at length alarmed,—not relishing, it appears, the idea of having the case
                           publicly discussed in the House of Commons; and to avert this result he submitted
                           to
                           temporize—assumed a demeanour of unwonted civility, and even hinted to Mr. Manning
                           (as I was given to understand) that if he was not driven to utter hostility by the
                           threatened exposure, he would probably meet our wishes “in his own time and way.”
                           Having gained time by these manœuvres, he adroitly endeavoured to cool the ardour
                           of
                           Mary's new friends, in her cause, by representing her as an abandoned and worthless
                           woman, ungrateful towards him, and undeserving of sympathy from others; allegations
                           which he supported by the ready affirmation of some of his West India friends, and
                           by
                           one or two plausible letters procured from Antigua. By these and like artifices he
                           appears completely to have imposed on Mr. Manning, the respectable West India
                           merchant whom Dr. Lushington had asked to negotiate with him; and he prevailed so
                           far
                           as to induce Dr. Lushington himself (actuated by the benevolent view of thereby best
                           serving Mary's cause,) to abstain from any remarks upon his conduct when the petition
                           was at last presented in Parliament. In this way he dextrously contrived to
                           neutralize all our efforts, until the close of the Session of 1829; soon after which
                           he embarked with his family for the West Indies.

                        <p id="d14544e789">Every exertion for Mary's relief having thus failed; and being fully convinced from
                           a
                           twelvemonth's observation of her conduct, that she was really a well-disposed and
                           respectable woman; I engaged her, in December 1829, as a domestic servant in my own
                           family. In this capacity she has remained ever since; and I am thus enabled to speak
                           of her conduct and character with a degree of confidence I could not have otherwise
                           done. The importance of this circumstance will appear in the sequel.

                        <p id="d14544e792">From the time of Mr. Wood's departure to Antigua, in 1829, till June or July last,
                           no
                           farther effort was attempted for Mary's relief. Some faint hope was still cherished
                           that this unconscionable man would at length relent, and “in his own time and way,”
                           grant the prayer of the exiled negro woman. After waiting, however, nearly
                           twelvemonths longer, and seeing the poor woman's spirits daily sinking under the
                           sickening influence of hope deferred, I resolved on a final attempt in her behalf,
                           through the intervention of the Moravian Missionaries, and of the Governor of
                           Antigua. At my request, Mr. Edward Moore, agent of the Moravian Brethren in London,
                           wrote to the Rev. Joseph Newby, their Missionary in that island, empowering him to
                           negotiate in his own name with Mr. Wood for Mary's manumission, and to procure his
                           consent, if possible, upon terms of ample pecuniary compensation. At the same time
                           the excellent and benevolent William Allen, of the Society of Friends, wrote to Sir
                           Patrick Ross, the Governor of the Colony, with whom he was on terms of friendship,
                           soliciting him to use his influence in persuading Mr. Wood to consent: and I confess
                           I was sanguine enough to flatter myself that we should thus at length prevail. The
                           result proved, however, that I had not yet fully appreciated the character of the
                           man
                           we had to deal with.

                        <p id="d14544e795">Mr. Newby's answer arrived early in November last, mentioning that <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="27"> </a></span> he had done all in his power to accomplish our purpose, but in vain; and
                           that if Mary's manumission could not be obtained without Mr. Wood's consent, he
                           believed there was no prospect of its ever being effected.

                        <p id="d14544e800">A few weeks afterwards I was informed by Mr. Allen, that he had received a letter
                           from Sir Patrick Ross, stating that he also had used his best endeavours in the
                           affair, but equally without effect. Sir Patrick at the same time inclosed a letter,
                           addressed by Mr. Wood to his Secretary, Mr. Taylor, assigning his reasons for
                           persisting in this extraordinary course. This letter requires our special attention.
