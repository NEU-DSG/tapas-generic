                           </hi> was an English clergyman,

                           <persName id="d71027e2033" ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>, was born. The
                           
                           <persName id="d71027e2036">Gattys</persName> seem to have been an exceptionally clever family. While the children
                           were still very young they learned to amuse each other by story-telling, and a little
                           later they
                           edited and wrote a story-magazine, which was not printed, but circulated in manuscript
                           among their
                           friends. 
                           <persName id="d71027e2039" ref="julianaewing">Juliana</persName> was particularly good as an oral
                           story-teller and mimic, and even as a child evidently had something of the magnetism
                           which is so
                           important an element in her nature work. Indeed, one can hardly think of her written
                           stories as mere
                           compositions; the author seems to be talking to us frankly and unaffectedly, and paper
                           and ink serve
                           only as conductors for that sweet and friendly voice. Her first book of stories was
                           published when
                           she was twenty-one years old, and from that time to the end of her not very long life
                           she was
                           producing tales in prose and verse, most of them about children.

                           and really the public continuation of the nursery magazine with which they had grown
                           up. At
                           twenty-five 
                           <persName id="d71027e2048" ref="julianaewing">Miss Juliana Gatty</persName> was married to 
                           <persName id="d71027e2051" ref="majorewing">Major Ewing</persName> of the British Army. Soon afterward hewas stationed in
                           
                           <placeName id="d71027e2054">New Brunswick</placeName>, where 
                           <persName id="d71027e2057" ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName>
                           and he lived for several <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="7" data-tei-n="iv"> </a></span> years. Here she naturally learned a good
                           deal about army life. It is odd that although she was continually writing stories,
                           many of which
                           were published in "Aunt Judy's Magazine," it did not occur to her for some time to
                           make literary use
                           of her army experience. At last in 1872, she wrote her first soldier story, "The Peace
                           Egg." This
                           tale is not very well known now, but the two which followed, "Jackanapes," and "The
                           Story of a Short
                           Life," not only became quickly popular, but are as widely read and as generously cried
                           over to-day
                           as they ever were.

                           where 
                           <persName id="d71027e2072" ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName> lived for the rest of her life. In 1873 a
                           part-editorship of "Aunt Judy's Magazine" fell into her hands, and was retained for
                           about two years.
                           But she had always been delicate. The routine of regular work was very difficult for
                           her; and when,
                           a few years after the return from

                           <placeName id="d71027e2082">Malta</placeName>, she was not strong
                           enough to go with him. Consequently they were separated for several years, and when

                           As a woman she was simple, sympathetic, and universally beloved; and she was the rare
                           sort of person
                           who is just as lovable in print as in real life. She is a writer of sentiment, but
                           of sentiment
                           wholly free from mawkishness or strained pathos. Her work is marked by a tender humor
                           which reminds
                           one of 
                           <persName id="d71027e2097">Dr. John Brown</persName> more than of anybody else. We are not so tolerant of the
                           pathetic as our fathers were in the days of

                           are so sad. But if the reader is not too ready to be cast down, he will notice that

                           life was a waste, or a slip on the part of Providence; and the lifelong grief of the

                           <persName id="d71027e2121" ref="julianaewing">Mrs. Ewing</persName> might not have been willing, considering them

                           seems to have felt that pain and death are preferable to selfishness and dishonor.

                              hen for the first time in all her motherly life got out of patience when she was sitting.
                              She
                              had been rather proud of the eggs, - they were unusually large, - but she never felt

                              comfortable on them; and whether it was because she used to get cramp and go off the
                              nest, or
                              because the season was bad, or what, she never could tell; but every egg was addled
                              but one, and
                              the one that did batch gave her more trouble than any chick she had ever reared.

                              family. And as to behavior, it was not that it was either quarrelsome or moping, but
                              simply
                              unlike the rest. When the other chicks hopped and cheeped on the

                              downiness and dumpiness slipping through his fingers as he fell upon his face.

                              through the churchyard stopped by a flat stone which he had lately helped to lay down.
                              The day before, a name had been cut on it, which he stayed to read; and below the
                              name
                              some one had scrawled a few words in pencil, which he read also -

                              </hi> On the stone lay a pencil, and a few feet
                              from it lay the 
                              <persName id="d71027e5801" ref="doc">Doctor</persName>, face downwards, as he had lain
                              all night, with the hoar frost on his black hair.

                           <p id="d71027e5805">Ah ! these gravestones (they were ugly things in those days; not the light, hopeful,
                              pretty crosses we set up now), how they seem remorselessly to imprison and keep our

                              dead friends away from us ! And yet they do not lie with a feather's weight upon the

                              and was dying, but he got better of it; and then that he was out of his mind, but
                              he got
                              better of that, and came out looking much as usual, except that his hair never seemed
                              quite so black again, as if a little of that night's hoar frost still remained. And
                              no
                              further misfortune happened to him that I ever heard of ; and as time went on he grew
                              a
                              beard, and got stout, and kept a German poodle, and gave tea-parties to other people's

                                          domesticate themselves in a house of which some grown-up
                                          human being pays the rent and taxes. They are like small
                                          editions of men and women, they are too small and fragile
                                          for heavy work; they have not the strength of a man, but are
                                          a thousand times more fresh and nimble. They can run and
                                          jump, and roll and tumble, with marvellous agility and
                                          endurance, and of many of the aches and pains which men and
                                          women groan under, they do not even know the names. They
                                          have no trade or profession, and as they live entirely upon
                                          other people, they know nothing of domestic cares; in fact,
                                          they know very little upon any subject, though they are
                                          often intelligent and highly inquisitive. They love
                                          dainties, play, and mischief. They are apt to be greatly
                                          beloved, and are themselves capriciously affectionate. They
                                          are little people, and can only do little things. When they
                                          are idle and mischievous, they are called Boggarts, and are
                                          a curse to the house they live in. When they are useful and
                                          considerate, they are Brownies, and are a much coveted
                                          blessing. Sometimes the Blessed Brownies will take up their
                                          abode with some worthy couple, cheer them with their romps
                                          and merry laughter, tidy the house, find things that have
                                          been lost, and take little troubles out of hands full of
                                          great anxieties. Then in time these Little People are
                                          Brownies no longer. They grow up into men and women. They do
                                          not care so much for dainties, play, or mischief. They cease
                                          to jump and tumble, and roll about the house. They know
                                          more, and laugh less. Then, when their heads begin to ache
                                          with anxiety, and they have to labor for their own living,
                                          and the great cares of life come on, other Brownies come and
                                          live with them, and take up their <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="68"> </a></span> little cares, and supply their little
                                          comforts, and make the house merry once more."

                              with the housework in which she had been so notable, <a href="#note_049" class="ref-note" rend="super">1</a> chafed him. The dirty kitchen was dreary, the
                              labor lonely, and it was an hour's time lost to his trade. But life does not
                              stand still while one is wishing, and so the 
                              <persName id="d71027e7938" ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> did that for which there was neither remedy nor
                              substitute; and came down this morning as other mornings to the pail and
                              broom. When he came in he looked round, and started, and rubbed his eyes;
                              looked round again, and rubbed them harder; then went up to the fire and
                              held out his hand (warm certainly) - then up to the table and smelt the
                              mush- rooms (esculent <a href="#note_050" class="ref-note" rend="super">2</a> fungi

                              swept floor, and the sunshine pouring in, and finally sat down in stunned
                              admiration. Then he jumped up and ran to the foot of the stairs, shouting,

                              farmhouse some miles up the valley. This was pleasant and advantageous sort
                              of work: good food, sure pay, and a cheerful change; but he did not know how
                              he could leave his family, unless, indeed, the Brownie might be relied upon
                              to "keep the house together," as they say. The boys were sure that he would,
                              and they promised to set his water, and to give as little trouble as
                              possible; so, finally, the 
                              <persName id="d71027e8134" ref="tailor">Tailor</persName> took up
                              his shears and went up the valley, where the green banks sloped up into
                              purple moor, or broke into sandy rocks, crowned with nodding oak fern. On to
                              the prosperous old farm, where he spent a very pleasant time, sitting level
                              with the window geraniums on a table set apart for him, stitching and
                              gossiping, gossiping and stitching, and feeling secure of honest payment
                              when his work was done. The mistress of the house was a kind, good creature,
                              and loved a chat; and though the 
                              <persName id="d71027e8137" ref="tailor">Tailor</persName>
                              kept his own secret as to the Brownies, he felt rather curious to know if
                              the Good People had any hand in the comfort of this flourishing household,
                              and watched his opportunity to make a few careless inquiries on the
                              subject.
