                                 supposed to prefer the metre in which it is written, abstractedly considered,
                                 to the regular blank verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement, of which our
                                 admirable language is capable. For the following Poem I have preferred it,
                                 because it suits the varied subject; it is the

                                 </bibl>, a volume which no lover of poetry will recollect without pleasure,
                                 induced me when a young versifier, to practise in this metre. I felt that while
                                 it gave the poet a wider range of expression, it satisfied the ear of the
                                 reader. It were easy to make a parade of learning by enumerating the various
                                 feet which it admits; it is only needful to observe that no two lines are
                                 employed in 
                                 <hi id="d101024e217" style="font-style: italic;">sequence</hi> which can be read into one. Two
                                 six-syllable lines (it will perhaps be answered) compose an Alexandrine: the
                                 truth is that the Alexandrine, when harmonious, is composed of two six-syllable
                                 lines.

                              <p id="d101024e221">One advantage this metre assuredly possesses; the dullest reader cannot distort
                                 it into discord: he may read it with a 
                                 <hi id="d101024e223" style="font-style: italic;">prose mouth</hi>, but
                                 its flow and fall will still be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured by
                                 the English reader: perhaps this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the regular
                                 Jews-harp 
                                 <hi id="d101024e226" style="font-style: italic;">twing-twang</hi>, of what has been foolishly called
                                 heroic measure. I do not wish the 
                                 <hi id="d101024e229" style="font-style: italic;">improvisatorè</hi> tune,
                                 but something that denotes the sense of harmony, something like the accent of
                                 feeling; like the tone which every Poet necessarily gives to Poetry.

                                          use them, for some part of the year, as their principal article of
                                          food. They afford a very agreeable liquor. When its fruit is nearly
                                          ripe, a hole is pierced into the pulp, this hole is then stopped
                                          with wax, and the melon left upon the stalk. Within a few days the
                                          pulp is in consequence of this process, converted into a delicious
                                          liquor.

                                          out the bread. When these winds begin to blow, the atmosphere
                                          assumes an alarming aspect. The sky at other times so clear, in
                                          this climate, becomes dark and heavy; the sun loses his splendour
                                          and appears of a violet colour. The air is not cloudy, but grey and
                                          thick, and is in fact filled with an extremely subtile dust, which
                                          penetrates every where. This wind, always light and rapid, is not
                                          at first remarkably hot, but it increases in heat in proportion as
                                          it continues. All animated bodies soon discover it, by the change
                                          it produces in them. The lungs which a too rarefied air no longer
                                          expands, are contracted and become painful. Respiration is short
                                          and difficult, the skin parched and dry, and the body consumed by
                                          an internal heat. In vain is recourse had to large draughts of
                                          water; nothing can restore perspiration. In vain is coolness sought
                                          for; all bodies in which it is usual to find it, deceives the hand

                                          whole mass of blood driven by the heart towards the head and
                                          breast; whence that hæmorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens
                                          after death. This wind is especially fatal to

                                          destroyed the tone of the muscles and the vessels. The corpse
                                          remains a long time warm, swells, turns blue and is easily
                                          separated; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation which
                                          takes place in animal bodies when the humours become stagnant.
                                          These accidents are to be avoided by stopping the nose and mouth
                                          with handkerchiefs; an efficacious method likewise is that
                                          practised by the camels, who bury their noses in the sand and keep
                                          them there till the squall is over.

                                          such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few
                                          minutes. By this extreme dryness it withers and strips all the
                                          plants, and by exhaling too suddenly the emanations from animal
                                          bodies, crisps the skin, closes the pores, and causes that feverish
                                          heat which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration.

                                          fastened there like a bracelet, and never failed to strike one
                                          against the other and make a slight noise when any poison was near.
                                          Upon enquiry it was found that Giafar carried poison in his ring,
                                          for the purpose of self-destruction in case he had been taken by

                                             against them: namely, they provide themselves armour of yron or
                                             steele against their arrowes, and weapons also poisoned with the
                                             poyson of trees, and they carry in their hands wooden stakes
                                             most sharp and hard-pointed, as if they were yron: likewise they
                                             shoot arrowes without yron heades, and so they confound and slay
                                             some of their unarmed foes trusting too securely unto the vertue
                                             of their stones.

                                          to stop the hole neere unto this Dam, or Sluce, and to recover the
                                          drowned land. These diggers being come to the place, they found at
                                          the entrie of this bottomlesse hole a Sea-dog, the which for six
                                          dayes together, did nothing but crie out and howle very fearefully.
                                          They, not knowing what it might signifie, having consulted of this
                                          accident, they resolved to cast this dogge into the hole. There was
                                          a mad-headed Hollander among the rest, who going into the bottome
                                          of the dike, tooke the dogge by the taile, and cast him into the
                                          middest of the gulfe; then speedily they cast earth and torfe into
                                          it, so as they found a bottome, and by little and little filled it
                                          up. And for that many workemen came to the repairing of this dike,
                                          who for that they would not be far from their worke, coucht in

                                          moveables, of which the following is a pretty exact inventory. A
                                          few male and female camels, some goats and poultry, a mare and her
                                          bridle and saddle, a tent, a lance sixteen feet long, a crooked
                                          sabre, a rusty musket, with a flint or matchlock; a pipe, a
                                          portable mill, a pot for cooking, a leathern bucket, a small coffee
                                          roaster, a mat, some clothes, a mantle of black woollen, and a few
                                          glass or silver rings, which the women wear upon their legs and
                                          arms; if none of these are wanting, their furniture is complete.
                                          But what the poor man stands most in need of, and what he takes
                                          most pleasure in, is his mare; for this animal is his principal
                                          support. With his mare the Bedouin makes his excursions against
                                          hostile tribes, or seeks plunder in the country, and on the
                                          highways. The mare is preferred to the horse, because she does not
                                          neigh, is more docile, and yields milk, which on occasion,
                                          satisfies the thirst and even the hunger of her master.

                                          passed for one of the most powerful of those districts; yet it did
                                          not appear to me that his expenditure was greater than that of an
                                          opulent farmer. His personal effects, consisting in a few pelisses,
                                          carpets, arms, horses, and camels, could not be estimated at more
                                          than fifty thousand livres (a little above two thousand pounds);
                                          and it must be observed that in this calculation four mares of the
                                          breed of racers are valued at six thousand livres, (two hundred and
                                          fifty pounds), and each camel at ten pounds sterling. We must not

                                          to the words Prince and Lord, the ideas they usually convey; we
                                          should come nearer the truth by comparing them to substantial
                                          farmers, in mountainous countries, whose simplicity they resemble
                                          in their dress as well as in their domestic life and manners. A
                                          Shaik, who has the command of five hundred horse, does not disdain
                                          to saddle and bridle his own, nor to give him his barley and
                                          chopped straw. In his tent, his wife makes the coffee, kneeds the
                                          dough, and superintends the dressing of the victuals. His daughters
                                          and kinswomen wash the linen, and go with pitchers on their heads,
                                          and veils over their faces, to draw water from the fountain. These
                                          manners agree precisely with the descriptions in

                                             </rs> They have a small place built with clay,
                                             between two and three feet high, having a hole at the bottom,
                                             for the convenience of drawing out the ashes, something similar
                                             to that of a lime kiln. The oven (which I think is the most
                                             proper name for this place) is usually about fifteen inches wide
                                             at the top, and gradually grows wider to the bottom. It is
                                             heated with wood, and when sufficiently hot, and perfectly clear
                                             from smoke, having nothing but clear embers at bottom (which
                                             continue to reflect great heat), they prepare the dough in a
                                             large bowl, and mould the cakes to the desired size on a board
                                             or stone placed near the oven. After they have kneaded the cake
                                             to a proper consistence, they pat it a little, then toss it
                                             about with great dexterity in one hand, till it is as thin as
                                             they choose to make it. They then wet one side of it with water,
                                             at the same time wetting the hand and arm, with which they put
                                             it into the oven. The wet side of the cake adheres fast to the
                                             side of the oven till it is sufficiently baked when if not paid
                                             sufficient attention to, it would fall down among the embers. If
                                             they were not exceedingly quick at this work, the heat of the
                                             oven would burn the skin from off their hands and arms; but with
                                             such amazing dexterity do they perform it, that one woman will
                                             continue keeping three or four cakes at a time in the oven till
                                             she has done baking. This mode, let me add, does not require
                                             half the fuel that is made use of in

                                             full of branches whereof the leaves are not bigger than, nor
                                             unlike to the leaves of pimpernel, only something longer. The
                                             flower at first is like the peaches, but at last turns white,
                                             and puts forth its fruit at the end of certain strings: as soon
                                             as the sun is set, the leaves close up the fruit, to preserve it
                                             from the dew, and open as soon as that luminary appears again.
                                             The fruit at first is green, but ripening it becomes of a dark
                                             grey, drawing towards a red, inclosed in husks, brown or twany,
                                             of taste a little bitter, like our prunelloes. The tree is as
                                             big as a walnut-tree, full of leaves, bearing its fruit at the
                                             branches, like the sheath of a knife, but not so straight,
                                             rather bent like a bow.

                                             nearly in the same style. They are of an oblong square form, and
                                             covered in the middle with a large dome, on the top of which is
                                             fixed a gilt crescent. In front there is a handsome portico
                                             covered with several small cupolas, and raised one step above
                                             the pavement of the court. The Turks sometimes in the hot
                                             season, perform their devotions there; and between the columns,
                                             upon cross iron bars, are suspended a number of lamps, for
                                             illuminations on the Thursday nights and on all festivals. The
                                             entrance into the Mosque is by one large door. All these
                                             edifices are solidly built of freestone, and in several the
                                             domes are covered with lead. The minarets stand on one side
                                             adjoining to the body of the Mosque. They are sometimes square,
                                             but more commonly round and taper, the gallery for the maazeen,
                                             or cryers, projecting a little from the column near the top, has
                                             some resemblance to a rude capital; and from this the spire
                                             tapering more in proportion than before, soon terminates in a
                                             point crowned with a crescent.

                                             they are usually placed in a circle, and constitute a Dou-war.

                                             for the purpose, the Arabs hang upon it their cloaths, baskets,

                                          the Arabebbah, while the narration itself is accompanied with the
                                          softest touches they are able to make, upon the Gaspah. The Tarr,
                                          another of their instruments, is made like a Sive, consisting (as
                                          Isidore describeth the Tympanum) of a thin rim or hoop of wood,
                                          with a skin of parchment stretched over the top of it. This serves

                                          fowls do, but both the male and female contribute to hatch them by
                                          the efficacy of their looks only; and therefore when one has
                                          occasion to go to look for food, it advertises its companion by its
                                          cry, and the other never stirs during its absence, but remains with
                                          its eyes fixed upon the eggs, till the return of its mate, and then
                                          goes in its turn to look for food, and this care of theirs is so
                                          necessary that it cannot be suspended for a moment, for if it
                                          should their eggs would immediately become addle.

                                          famines; but the Moors find a kind of compensation in making food

                                          was ravaged by these insects. In the summer of that year, such
                                          clouds of locusts came from the south that they darkened the air,
                                          and devoured a part of the harvest. Their offspring, which they
                                          left on the ground, committed still much greater mischief. Locusts
                                          appeared and bred anew in the following year, so that in the spring
                                          the country was wholly covered, and they crawled one over the other
                                          in search of their subsistence.

                                          country once becomes thus afflicted. In order to preserve the
                                          houses and gardens in the neighbourhood of cities, they dig a ditch
                                          two feet in depth and as much in width. This they pallisade with
                                          reeds close to each other, and inclined inward toward the ditch; so
                                          that the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed, fall back
                                          into the ditch, where they devour one another.

                                          a league in extent, formed a semicircle from the sea to river,
                                          which separates Rabat from Sallee. The quantity of young locusts
                                          here assembled was so prodigious that, on the third day, the ditch
                                          could not be approached because of the stench. The whole country

                                          The dry winter had checked the products of the earth, and given
                                          birth to a new generation of locusts, who devoured whatever had
                                          escaped from the inclemency of the season. The husbandman did not
                                          reap even what he had sowed, and found himself destitute of food,
                                          cattle, or seed corn. In this time of extreme wretchedness the poor
                                          felt all the horrors of famine. They were seen wandering over the
                                          country to devour roots, and, perhaps, abridged their days by

                                          country people in the roads, and in the streets, who had died of
                                          hunger, and who were thrown across asses to be taken and buried.
                                          Fathers sold their children. The husband, with the consent of his
                                          wife, would take her into another province, there to bestow her in
                                          marriage as if she were his sister, and afterwards come and reclaim
                                          her when his wants were no longer so great. I have seen women and
                                          children run after camels, and rake in their dung to seek for some
                                          indigested grain of barley, which, if they found, they devoured
                                          with avidity.

                                          better deserves to be described, perhaps, than most others of which
                                          travellers have given us an account, because the facts relating to
                                          it are not only strange, in themselves, but so well and distinctly
                                          attested, that however surprising they may seem, we cannot but
                                          afford them our belief. The food of this creature is the locust, or
                                          the grasshopper: it is of the size of an ordinary hen, its feathers
                                          black, its wings large, and its flesh of a greyish colour; they fly
                                          generally in great flocks, as the starlings are wont to do with us:
                                          but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is, that they are
                                          so fond of the water of a certain fountain in

                                          cavalettes, or locusts, that they obscured sometimes the splendour
                                          of the sun. Wherever these came, they burnt and eat up all; for
                                          this there was no remedy, since, as fast as they were destroyed,
                                          the earth produced more:

                                          house or vault, and being set on an high place, certain birds which
                                          follow it, and fly and cry after the men who carry it from the
                                          fountain, come to the place where it is fixed. These birds are red

                                          Cyprus, but they destroyed the locusts with which the Island was
                                          infested; but if the water be spilt or lost these creatures
                                          immediately disappear; which accident fell out when the Turks took
                                          this Island; for one of them going up into the steeple of

                                          that it contained gold or silver, or some precious thing, broke it,
                                          and spilt what was therein; since which the Cypriots have been as

                                          Locust Bird, without seeing it. They there call it 
                                          <hi id="d101024e11777" style="font-style: italic;">Samarmar</hi>, or as others pronounce it,

                                          a sparrow, and no ways pleasant to the palate. I am assured that it
                                          every day destroys an incredible number of Locusts; they pretend
                                          nevertheless that the Locusts sometimes defend themselves, and
                                          devour the Bird with its feathers, when they have overpowered it by
                                          numbers. When the children in the frontier towns of

                                          before them and cry

                                          stoops down terrified at the noise, or at the motion of the child,
                                          or clings more closely to its place, the children believe that it
                                          fears the name of its enemy, that it hides itself, and attempts to
                                          throw stones. The

                                          upon the forehead, their colour is green throughout the whole body,
                                          excepting a little yellow rim that surrounds their head, which is
                                          lost at their eyes. This insect has two upper wings pretty solid:
                                          they are green like the rest of the body, except that there is in
                                          each a little white spot. The Locust keeps them extended like great
                                          sails of a ship going before the wind, it has besides two other
                                          wings underneath the former, and which resemble a light transparent
                                          stuff pretty much like a cobweb, and which it makes use of in the
                                          manner of smack sails that are along a vessel; but when the Locust
                                          reposes herself she does like a vessel that lies at anchor, for she
                                          keeps the second sails furled under the first.

                                          first this was to me a strange appearance, however it was only the

                                          ground like all others. There was nothing then extraordinary in
                                          this phenomenon, and I afterwards saw many appearances exactly
                                          similar in the dry Countries.

                                          in the day, and for his bed and covering in the night. It is a
                                          loose but troublesome kind of garment, being frequently
                                          disconcerted and falling upon the ground, so that the person who
                                          wears it, is every moment obliged to tuck it up, and fold it anew
                                          about his body. This shews the great use there is for a girdle in

                                          weave in looms hung lengthways in their tents. These looms are
                                          formed by a list of an ell and a half long, to which the threads of
                                          the warp are fixed at one end, and at the other on a roller of
                                          equal length; the weight of which, being suspended, keeps them
                                          stretched. The threads of the warp are so hung as to be readily
                                          intersected. Instead of shuttles, the women pass the thread of the
                                          woof thro' the warp with their fingers, and with an iron comb,
                                          having a handle, press the woof to give a body to their cloth. Each

                                          the size of a hen, their colour a rich purple, inclining to red.
                                          They are white when hatched, and soon become black, but as they

                                          filled our hearts with a very short-lived joy. The whole plain
                                          before us seemed thick covered with green grass and yellow daisies.
                                          We advanced to the place with as much speed as our lame condition
                                          would suffer us, but how terrible was our disapointment, when we
                                          found the whole of that verdure to consist in senna and
                                          coloquintida, the most nauseous of plants, and the most incapable
                                          of being substituted as food for man or beast.

                                          killed for the sustenance of the Arabs, are carried away bones and
                                          all together. Of the hides are made the soles of the slippers which
                                          are worn in

                                          what the sun can give them. The circumstances of this animal's
                                          death, when his strength fails him on the road, have something in
                                          them affecting to humanity. Such are his patience and perseverance,
                                          that he pursues his journey without flagging, as long as he has
                                          power to support its weight; and such are his fortitude and spirit,
                                          that he will never give out, until nature sinks beneath the
                                          complicated ills which press upon him. Then, and then only, will he
                                          resign his burden and body to the ground. Nor stripes, nor caresses
                                          nor food, nor rest, will make him rise again! His vigor is
                                          exhausted, and life ebbs out apace! This the Arabs are very
                                          sensible of, and kindly plunge a sword into the breast of the dying
                                          beast, to shorten his pangs. Even the Arab feels remorse when he
                                          commits this deed: his hardened heart is moved at the loss of a
                                          faithful servant.

                                          the breadth in which they carry their legs, when they slip, often

                                          lest he should consume too much, she has contracted his stomach,
                                          and obliged him to chew the cud. She has lined his foot with a lump
                                          of flesh, which, sliding in the mud, and being no way adapted for

                                          his enemies. Destitute of the horns of the bull, the hoofs of the

                                          began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of thirst. To
                                          relieve the burning pain in my mouth and throat, I chewed the
                                          leaves of different shrubs, but found them all bitter and of no
                                          service to me. 
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p id="d101024e15269"> A little before sunset, having reached the top of a gentle rising,
                                          I climbed a high tree, from the topmost branches of which I cast a
                                          melancholy look over the barren wilderness, but without discovering
                                          the most distant trace of a human dwelling. The same dismal
                                          uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents itself, and the
                                          horizon, was as level and uninterrupted as that of the sea. 
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p id="d101024e15272"> Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring the stubble
                                          and brushwood with great avidity; and as I was now too faint to
                                          attempt walking, and my horse too much fatigued to carry me, I
                                          thought it but an act of humanity, and perhaps the last I should
                                          ever have it in my power to perform, to take off his bridle and let
                                          him shift for himself: in doing which I was suddenly affected with
                                          sickness and giddiness, and falling upon the sand, felt as if the
                                          hour of death was fast approaching. Here then, thought I, after a
                                          short but ineffectual struggle, terminate all my hopes of being
                                          useful in my day and generation; here must the short span of my
                                          life come to an end.—I cast (as I believed) a last look on the
                                          surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the awful change that
                                          was about to take place, 
                                          <placeName id="d101024e15274" ref="the_world">this

                                          recollection.

                                          resumed its functions; and on recovering my senses, I found myself
                                          stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand, and the
                                          sun just sinking behind the trees. I now summoned all my
                                          resolution, and determined to make another effort to prolong my
                                          existence. And as the evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to
                                          travel as far as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching (my
                                          only resource) a watering place. With this view I put the bridle on
                                          my horse, and driving him before me, went slowly along for about an
                                          hour, when I perceived some lightning from the north east, a most
                                          delightful sight, for it promised rain. The darkness and lightning
                                          increased very rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard the wind
                                          roaring among the bushes. I had already opened my mouth to receive
                                          the refreshing drops which I expected, but I was instantly covered
                                          with a cloud of sand, driven with such force by the wind as to give
                                          a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms, and I was
                                          obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush, to prevent being
                                          suffocated. The sand continued to fly in amazing quantities for
                                          near an hour, after which I again set forward, and travelled with
                                          difficulty, until ten o'clock. About this time I was agreeably
                                          surprized by some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a
                                          few heavy drops of rain. In a little time the sand ceased to fly,
                                          and I alighted, and spread out all my clean clothes to collect the
                                          rain, which at length I saw would certainly fall.—For more than an
                                          hour it rained plentifully, and I quenched my thirst, by wringing
                                          and sucking my clothes.

                                          three. To look on, they seem little different from the rest of that

                                          their Kind, and consequently of higher Price and Esteem. None lie
                                          in that Trance more than ten Days and Nights. These that do, are
                                          pretty rare, and are called Ashari from Aashara, which signifies
                                          ten in Arabick. I saw one such, perfectly white all over, belonging
                                          to Lella Oumane Princess of that noble Arab Neja, named Hayl ben
                                          Ali, I spoke of, and upon which she put a very great Value, never
                                          sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary Occasion, when the
                                          greatest Expedition was required; having others, inferior in
                                          swiftness, for more ordinary Messages. They say that one of these
                                          Aasharies will, in one Night, and thro' a level Country, traverse
                                          as much Ground as any single Horse can perform in ten, which is no
                                          Exaggeration of the Matter, since many have affirmed to me, that it
                                          makes nothing of holding its rapid Pace, which is a most violent
                                          Hard Trot, for four and twenty Hours upon a Stretch without shewing
                                          the least Sign of Weariness, or Inclination to Bait; and that
                                          having then swallowed a Ball or two of Sort of a Paste, made up of
                                          Barley-Meal, and may be a little Powder of Dates among it, with a
                                          Bowl of Water, or Camel's Milk, if to be had, and which the Courier
                                          seldom forgets to be provided with, in Skins, as well for the

                                       <p id="d101024e15411"> I happened to be, once in particular, at the Tent of that
                                          Princess, with Ali ben Mahamoud, the Bey, or Vice-Roy of the
                                          Algerine Eastern Province, when he went thither to celebrate his
                                          Nuptials with Ambarca, her only Daughter, if I mistake not. Among
                                          other Entertainments she gave her Guests, the favourite white
                                          Dromedary was brought forth, ready Saddled and Bridled. I say
                                          Bridled, because the Thong, which serves instead of a Bridle, was
                                          put thro' the Hole purposely made in the Gristle of the Creature's
                                          Nose. The Arab appointed to mount, was straightly laced, from the
                                          very Loins quite to his Throat, in a strong Leathern Jacket; they
                                          never riding these Animals any otherwise accoutred, so impetuously
                                          violent are the Concussions the Rider undergoes, during that rapid
                                          Motion, that were he to be loose. I much question whether a few
                                          Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger the bursting
                                          of some of his Entrails: And this the Arabs scruple not to
                                          acknowledge. We were to be diverted with seeing this fine Ashari
                                          run against some of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja, which is
                                          famed for having good ones, of the true Libyan Breed, shaped like
                                          Greyhounds, and which will sometimes run down an Ostridge; which
                                          few of the very best can pretend to do, especially upon a hard
                                          Ground, perfectly level. We all started like Racers, and for the
                                          first Spurt, most of the best mounted among us kept up pretty well,
                                          but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged: Several of the Libyan and
                                          Numidian Runners held Pace till we, who still followed upon a good
                                          round Hand Gallop, could no longer discern them, and then gave out;
                                          as we were told after their Return. When the Dromedary had been out
                                          of our Sight about half an Hour, we again espied it flying towards
                                          us with an amazing Volocity, and in a very few Moments was among
                                          us, and seemingly nothing concerned; while the Horses and Mares
                                          were all on a Foam, and scarce able to breathe, as was, likewise, a
                                          fleet, tall Greyhound Bitch, of the young Prince's, who had
                                          followed and kept Pace the whole Time, and was no sooner got back
                                          to us, but lay down panting as if ready to expire. I cannot tell
                                          how many Miles we went; but we were near three Hours in coming
                                          leisurely back to the Tents, yet made no Stop in the Way. The young
                                          Prince Hamet ben al Guydom ben Sakhari, and his younger Brother
                                          Messoud, told their new Brother-in-Law, that they defied all the
                                          Potentates of 
                                          <placeName id="d101024e15413">Africa</placeName> to shew him such an
                                          Ashari; and the Arab who rode it, challenged the Bey to lay his
                                          Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats, that he did not bring him an Answer to
                                          a Letter from the Prince of Wargala, in less than four Days, tho'
                                          Leo Africanus, Marmol, and several others assure us, that it is no
                                          less than forty Spanish Leagues, of four Miles each, South of
                                          Tuggurt to which Place, upon another Occasion, as I shall observe,
                                          we made six tedious Days March from the Neighbourhood of Biscara,
                                          North of which we were then, at least thirty Hours riding, if I
                                          remember rightly. However the Bey, who was a Native of Biscara, and
                                          consequently well acquainted with the Sahara, durst not take him
                                          up. By all Circumstances, and the Description given us, besides
                                          what I know of the Matter my self, it could not be much less than
                                          400 Miles, and as many back again, the fellow offered to ride, in
                                          so short a Time; nay many other Arabs boldly proffered to venture

                                          number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances, at
                                          times moving with great celerity, at others stalking with a
                                          majestic slowness: at intervals we thought they were coming in a
                                          very few moments to overwhelm us, and small quantities of sand did
                                          actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to
                                          be almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds.
                                          There the tops often separated from the bodies, and these once
                                          disjoined, dispersed in the air and did not appear more. Sometimes
                                          they were broken near the middle, as if struck with a large cannon
                                          shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness
                                          upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged
                                          alongside of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest
                                          diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it
                                          would measure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E.

                                          nests upon the tops of the minarets, and the loftiest houses.

                                          there is scarcely a house which has not several nests upon it. They
                                          are very tame, and the inhabitants never molest them. When any
                                          thing disturbs these birds, they make a violent clatter with their
                                          long beaks, which is sometimes repeated by the others all over the
                                          town; and this noise will sometimes continue for several minutes.
                                          It is as loud as a watchman's rattle, and not much unlike it in
                                          sound.

                                          couple had made their nest, which is bigger in circumference than a
                                          bushel, on a dome close by our chamber. This pair stood, side by
                                          side, with great gravity, shewing no concern at what was
                                          transacting beneath them, but at intervals twisting about their
                                          long necks, and cluttering with their beaks, turned behind them
                                          upon their backs, as it were in concert. This was continued the
                                          whole night. An Owl, a bird also unmolested, was perched hard by,
                                          and as frequently hooted. The crane is tall, like a heron, but much
                                          larger; the body white, with black pinions, the neck and legs very
                                          long, the head small, and the bill thick.

                                          part of it standing, which is compassed and almost covered with the
                                          aforesayd fallings: this Tower was builded and made of foure-square
                                          brickes, which brickes were made of earth, and dried in the Sunne
                                          in maner and forme following: first they layed a lay of brickes,
                                          then a mat made of canes, square as the brickes, and instead of
                                          lime, they daubed it with earth: these mats of canes are at this
                                          time so strong, that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde, being of
                                          such great antiquity: I have gone round about it, and have not
                                          found any place where there hath bene any doore or entrance: it may
                                          be in my judgement in circuit about a mile, and rather lesse than
                                          more.

                                          a very great thing, and the nerer you come to it the lesser. My
                                          judgement and reason of this is, that because the Tower is set in a
                                          very great plaine, and hath nothing more about to make any shew
                                          saving the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and for
                                          this respect descrying it afarre off, that piece of the Tower which
                                          yet standeth with the mountaine that is made of the substance that

                                          in the sun, which is extreme hot in those parts. In laying these
                                          bricks neither lime nor sand was employed, but only earth tempered
                                          and petrified, and in those parts which made the floors, there had

                                          several other bricks of the same size, but more solid and burnt in
                                          a kiln, and set in good lime, or bitumen, nevertheless the greatest

                                          called Tusbah, or implement of praise. It consists, if I recollect

                                          devotion is called Taleel, from the repetition of the letter L, or
                                          Laum, which occurs in the word

                                          the streets, and in the interval of conversation in company. The
                                          rosaries of persons of fortune and rank have the beads of diamonds,
                                          pearls, rubies and emeralds. Those of the humble are strung with
                                          berries, coral, or glass beads.

                                          long piece of coral and a large bead of the same. The more devout,
                                          or hypocritical Turks, like the Catholics have usually their bead

                                          cross, and of fleaing alive. The Devil who had long served him,

                                          flesh and endeavoured to get at his brain. The Devil now suggested
                                          a remedy, which was to quiet them by giving them every day the
                                          brains of two men, killed for that purpose: this tyranny lasted

                                          but I have thrice assisted at the definitive judgment of certain
                                          criminals, who, under the torture, confessed having used it. Being
                                          asked what it was, how they procured it, and what were its uses and
                                          properties? they answered, first, that the use of the Hand of Glory
                                          was to stupify those to whom it was presented, and to render them
                                          motionless, insomuch that they could not stir, any more than if
                                          they were dead; secondly, that it was the hand of a hanged man; and
                                          thirdly, that it must be prepared in the manner following. 
                                       </p>
                                       
                                       <p id="d101024e18182"> Take the hand, left or right, of a person hanged and exposed on
                                          the highway; wrap it up in a piece of a shroud or winding sheet, in
                                          which let it be well squeezed, to get out any small quantity of
                                          blood that may have remained in it; then put it into an earthen
                                          vessel with Zimat saltpetre, salt, and long pepper, the whole well
                                          powdered; leave it fifteen days in that vessel; afterwards take it
                                          out, and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days, till it is
                                          thoroughly dry, and if the Sun is not sufficient, put it into an
                                          oven heated with fern and vervain. Then compose a kind of candle
                                          with the fat of a hanged man, virgin wax, and sisame of Lapland.
                                          The Hand of Glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle,
                                          when lighted. Its properties are, that wheresoever any one goes
                                          with this dreadful instrument, the persons to whom it is presented
                                          will be deprived of all power of motion. On being asked if there
                                          was no remedy or antidote, to counteract this charm, they said the
                                          Hand of Glory would cease to take effect, and thieves could not
                                          make use of it, if the threshold of the door of the house, and
                                          other places by which they might enter, were anointed with an
                                          unguent composed of the gall of a black cat, the fat of a white
                                          hen, and the blood of a screech owl, which mixture must necessarily
                                          be prepared during the dog days.

                                          sow under their caps, to prevent fascination and witchcraft, and to
                                          secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes. The virtue of

                                          universal, that they suspend them upon the necks of their cattle,
                                          horses and other beasts of burthen.

                                          attended, for above the space of an hour, with an Ignis Fatuus,
                                          that displayed itself in a variety of extraordinary appearances.
                                          For it was sometimes globular, or like the flame of a candle;
                                          immediately after it would spread itself and involve our whole
                                          company in its pale inoffensive light, then at once contract itself
                                          and disappear. But in less than a minute it would again exert
                                          itself as at other times, or else, running along from one place to
                                          another with a swift progressive motion, would expand itself, at
                                          certain intervals over more than two or three acres of the adjacent
                                          mountains. The atmosphere from the beginning of the evening, had
                                          been remarkably thick and hazy, and the dew, as we felt it upon our
                                          bridles, was unusually clammy and unctuous. In the like disposition
                                          of the weather, I have observed those luminous bodies, which at sea

                                          which is of an intense heat, and falls afterwards into the Ze-nati.
                                          At a small distance from these hot fountains, we have others, which

                                          Meskouteen, we are to observe farther of them, that their
                                          water is of so intense a heat, that the rocky ground it runs over,
                                          to the distance sometimes of a hundred foot, is dissolved, or
                                          rather calcined by it. When the substance of these rocks is soft
                                          and uniform, then the water by making every way equal impressions,
                                          leaveth them in the shape of cones or hemispheres; which being six
                                          foot high and a little more or less of the same diameter, the Arabs
                                          maintain to be so many tents of their predecessors turned into
                                          stone. But when these rocks, besides their usual soft chalky
                                          substance, contain likewise some layers of harder matter, not so
                                          easy to be dissolved, then, in proportion to the resistance the
                                          water is thereby to meet with, we are entertained with a confusion
                                          of traces and channels, distinguished by the Arabs into Sheep,
                                          Camels, Horses, nay into Men, Women and Children, whom they suppose
                                          to have undergone the like fate with their habitations. I observed
                                          that the fountains which afforded this water, had been frequently
                                          stopped up: or rather ceasing to run at one place, broke out
                                          immediately in another, which circumstance seems not only to
                                          account for the number of cones, but for that variety likewise of
                                          traces, that are continued from one or other of these cones or
                                          fountains, quite down to the river Zenati.

                                          may suppose, in escaping continually thro' these fountains, that

                                          time to time their companions visited them, with the most precious
                                          odours. These odours were the usual food of the Peris, and procured
                                          them also another advantage, for they prevented the Dives from

                                          drew near the cage in which a Peri was suspended.

                                       <p id="d101024e20344"> The King and the great Lords have a sort of cellar for
                                          magnificence, where they sometimes drink with persons whom they
                                          wish to regale. These cellars are square rooms, to which you
                                          descend by only two or three steps. In the middle is a small
                                          cistern of water, and a rich carpet covers the ground from the
                                          walls to the cistern. At the four corners of the cistern are four
                                          large glass bottles, each containing about twenty quarts of wine,
                                          one white, another red. From one to the other of these, smaller
                                          bottles are ranged of the same material and form, that is, round
                                          with a long neck, holding about four or five quarts, white and red
                                          alternately. Round the cellar are several rows of niches in the
                                          wall, and in each nich is a bottle also of red and white
                                          alternately.—Some niches are made to hold two. Some windows give
                                          light to the apartment, and all these bottles so well ranged with
                                          their various colours have a very fine effect to the eye. They are
                                          always kept full, the wine preserving better, and therefore are
                                          replenished as fast as they are emptied.

                                          transpiration. So that they who desire to drink cool and
                                          deliciously, never drink in the same pot above five or six days at
                                          most. They wash it with rose water the first time, to take away the
                                          ill smell of the earth, and they hang it in the air full of water,
                                          wrapped up in a moist linen cloth. A fourth part of the water
                                          transpires in six hours the first time; after that still less from
                                          day to day, till at last the pores are closed up by the thick
                                          matter contained in the water which stops in the pores. But so soon
                                          as the pores are stopt, the water stinks in the pots, and you must
                                          take new ones.

                                          a drop of water, either from the sky or otherwise. When the vintage

                                          afterwards they cut off all the great wood, and leave only the
                                          young stocks about three foot high, which need no propping up with
                                          poles as in other places, and therefore they never make use of any
                                          such supporters.

                                          breadth. They are built after an irregular form, in regard of two
                                          great heaps of a rock that stand in the river, upon which they laid
                                          so many arches. Those at the two ends are hollowed on both sides

                                          great delight, and to which there is a descent of two pair of

                                          praise on Burnet in saying that he had "blended scripture, history,
                                          and tradition into one magnificent system, with a sublimity of
                                          imagination scarcely inferior to Milton himself." This work should
                                          be read in Latin, the Author's own translation is miserably
                                          inferior. He lived in the worst age of English prose.

                                          attacked their captors. This bold resolution, says Marigny, was not
                                          inspired by impotent anger. Most of these women had military
                                          inclinations already; particularly those who were of the tribe of
                                          Hemiar or of the Homerites, where they are early exercised in
                                          riding the horse, and in using the bow, the lance, and the javelin.
                                          The revolt was successful, for during the engagement Derar came up
                                          to their assistance.

                                             hawk. The hare cannot run long where the hawk behaves properly,
                                             but sometimes getting the start of the dogs, she gains the next
                                             hill and escapes. It now and then happens when the hawk is
                                             fierce and voracious in an unusual degree, that the hare is
                                             struck dead at the first stroke, but that is very uncommon; for
                                             the hawks preferred for hare hunting are taught to pounce and
                                             buffet the game, not to seize it, and they rise a little between
                                             each attack, to descend again with fresh force. In this manner
                                             the game is confused and retarded, till the greyhounds come in.

                                             relate, I should hardly venture to assert that with this bird,
                                             which is about the size of a pigeon, they sometimes take large
                                             Eagles. The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle
                                             under his pinion, and thus depriving him of the use of one wing,
                                             both birds fell to the ground together: but I am informed the
                                             present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on the back between the
                                             wings, which has the same effect, only that the bird tumbling
                                             down more slowly, the Falconer has more time to come in to his
                                             Hawk's assistance; but in either case, if he be not very
                                             expeditious, the Falcon is inevitably destroyed.

                                             disused in his time, probably from its ending more frequently in
                                             the death of the Falcon than of the Eagle. But he had often seen
                                             the Shaheen take Herons and Storks. "The hawk when thrown off
                                             flies for some time in a horizontal line not six feet from the
                                             ground, then mounting perpendicularly with astonishing
                                             swiftness, he seizes his prey under the wing, and both together
                                             come tumbling to the ground. If the Falconer is not expeditious
                                             the game soon disengages itself.

                                             and stuff it with straw to the shape of the animal. After fixing
                                             it in the place where they usually train the bird, they place
                                             his food upon the head of the stuffed stag, and chiefly in the
                                             two cavities of the eyes, that the Bird may strike there. Having
                                             accustomed him for several days to eat in this manner, they

                                             speed. They do the same with the wild boar, the ass, the fox,

                                             stop a horseman at full speed, nor will they quit him till

                                             time; the pain of this sets him running about like a distracted

                                             very gentle and tame. A horseman carries it, and on perceiving
                                             the Gazelle lets it loose: and tho' the Gazelle is incredibly
                                             swift, it is so nimble that in three bounds it leaps upon the
                                             neck of its prey. The Gazelle is a sort of small antelope, of
                                             which the country is full. The Ounce immediately strangles it
                                             with its sharp talons, but if unluckily it misses its blow and
                                             the Gazelle escapes, it remains upon the spot ashamed and
                                             confused, and at that moment a child might take or kill it
                                             without its attempting to defend itself.

                                                bodies of the trees. Those of the province of

                                                to sell in the province of

                                                the tree, whence they creep up, spreading themselves
                                                wonderfully over all the branches. Having placed themselves
                                                there, they gnaw, pierce, and bore to the very pith, and

                                          the funeral which arrived. A Turk preceded it, bearing upon his
                                          head a small chest; four other Turks carried the bier upon their
                                          shoulders, then came the father, the relations and the friends of
                                          the dead in great numbers. Their cries ceased at the entrance of
                                          the burial ground, but then they quarrelled—and for this. The man
                                          who bore the chest opened it, it was filled with copies of the
                                          Koran, a croud of Turks, young and old, threw themselves upon the
                                          books and scrambled for them. Those who succeeded ranged themselves
                                          around the Iman, and all at once began to recite the Koran, almost
                                          as Boys say their lesson. Each of the readers received ten parats,
                                          about fifteen sols, wrapt in paper. It was then for these fifteen
                                          pence that these pious assistants had quarrelled, and in our own
                                          country you might have seen them fight for less.

                                          still working, and perfumes were burnt by it. After the reading of
                                          the Koran the Iman chanted some Arabic prayers, and his full-chant
                                          would, no doubt, have appeared to you, as it did to me, very

                                          liker to mist. It covered the face of the whole country for several

                                          size, so large indeed that the finest Planes, Sycamores, and other
                                          large trees which we had seen could not be compared with them.
                                          Besides these principal Cedars, there were a great number of lesser
                                          ones, and some very small, mingled with the large trees, or in
                                          little clumps near them. They differed not in their foliage, which
                                          resembles the Juniper, and is green throughout the year: but the
                                          great Cedars spread at their summit and form a perfect round,
                                          whereas the small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the Cypress.
                                          Both diffuse the same pleasant odour; the large ones only yield
                                          fruit, a large cone in shape almost like that of the Pine, but of a
                                          browner colour, and compacter shell. It gives a very pleasant
                                          odour, and contains a sort of thick and transparent balm, which
                                          oozes out thro' small apertures, and falls drop by drop. This fruit
                                          which it is difficult to separate from the stalk, contains a nut
                                          like that of the Cypress; it grows at the end of the boughs, and
                                          turns its point upwards.

                                       <p id="d101024e32626"> The nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk, or the part
                                          between the root and the first branches; for the largest Cedars
                                          which we saw did not in the height of their trunks exceed six or
                                          seven feet. From this low but enormously thick body, prodigious
                                          branches rise, spreading as they rise, and forming by the
                                          disposition of their boughs and leaves which point upward, a sort
                                          of wheel which appears to be the work of art. The bark of the

                                          the Chief Physician was greatly alarmed, "in regard his life
                                          depended upon the King's, or if his life were spared yet he was
                                          sure to lose his estate and his liberty, as happens to all those
                                          who attend the Asiatic Sovereigns, when they die under their care.
                                          The Queen Mother too accused him of treason or ignorance, believing
                                          that since he was her Son's Physician he was obliged to cure him.
                                          This made the Physician at his wits end, so that all his receipts
                                          failing him, he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly his
                                          own invention, and which few physicians would ever have found out,
                                          as not being to be met with neither in Galen nor Hippocrates. What
                                          does he then do, but out of an extraordinary fetch of his wit, he
                                          begins to lay the fault upon the stars and the King's Astrologers,
                                          crying out that they were altogether in the wrong, that if the King
                                          lay in a languishing condition and could not recover his health it
                                          was because they had failed to observe the happy hour, or the
                                          Aspect of a fortunate constellation at the time of his coronation."
                                          The stratagem succeeded, the King was recrowned and by the new name
                                          of Solyman!

                                          Exodus, when the Sun was in a sign of the Zodiac correspondent to
                                          that part, casting them out of divers metals mixt together and

                                          at several times, and being put and fastened together in the form
                                          of a man, had the faculty to reveal to the said Albertus the
                                          solutions of all his principal difficulties. To which they add
                                          (that nothing be lost of the story of the statue) that it was
                                          battered to pieces by St. Thomas, meerely because he could not
                                          endure its excesse of prating.

                                          as also of all these miraculous heads, I conceive the original of
                                          this fable may well be deduced from the Teraph of the Hebrews, by
                                          which as Mr. Selden affirms, many are of opinion, that we must
                                          understand what is said in Genesis concerning Laban's Gods, and in
                                          the first book of Kings concerning the image which Michol put into
                                          the bed in David's place. For R. Eleazar holds that it was made of
                                          the head of a male child, the first born and that dead-born, under
                                          whose tongue they applyed a lamen of Gold, whereon were engraved
                                          the characters and inscriptions of certain planets, which the Jews
                                          superstitiously wandered up and down with, instead of the Urim and
                                          Thummim, or the Ephod of the High Priest. And that this original is
                                          true and well deduced, there is a manifest indicium, in that Henry
                                          D'Assia, and Bartholomæus Sibillus affirm, that the Androides of
                                          Albertus, and the Head made by Virgil, were composed of flesh and
                                          bone, yet not by nature, but by art. But this being judged
                                          impossible by modern Authors, and the vertue of Images, Annulets,
                                          and planetary Sigills being in great reputation, men have thought
                                          ever since (taking their opinion from Trismegistus affirming in his
                                          Asclepion, that of the Gods, some were made by the Sovereign God,
                                          and others by men, who, by some art, had the power to unite the
                                          invisible Spirits to things visible and corporeal, as is explained
                                          at large by St. Augustine) that such figures were made of copper or
                                          some other metal, whereon men had wrought under some favourable
                                          Aspects of Heaven and the planets.

                                          head or statue of man, like that of Memnon, from which proceeded a
                                          small sound and pleasant noise, when the rising Sun came by his
                                          heat to rarify and force out, by certain small conduits, the air
                                          which in the cold of the night was condensed within it. Or haply

                                             had done. When the scale inclined to the Apostle, he took the
                                             Soul, and introduced it thro' the Eastern gate, into the fire of
                                             Purgatory, that there it might expiate its crimes. But when the
                                             scale inclined and sunk towards the Devil, then he and his
                                             Angels snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the
                                             father and mother that begot it to eternal torments, and cast it
                                             with laughter and grinning into the deep and fiery pit which was

                                             being in my chamber, in the city of Vienna, saying my prayers,
                                             saw a legion of Devils in the air, who were making a great
                                             noise. I adjured one of them to tell me from whence they came,
                                             and wherefore they made so great an uproar. And he replied that
                                             they came from 
                                             <placeName id="d101024e34395">Aix la Chapelle</placeName>, where a
                                             great Lord had died, and that they were returning in anger
                                             because they had not been able to carry away his soul. I asked
                                             him who the great Lord was, and why they had not been able to
                                             carry away his soul. He replied that it was Charlemagne, and
                                             that Saint Jago had been greatly against them. And I asked him
                                             how St. Jago had been against them; and he replied, we were

                                          secrecy, and with much religious superstition. The bowels are, by
                                          these people, considered as the immediate organs of sensation,
                                          where the first impressions are received, and by which all the
                                          operations of the mind are carried on: it is therefore natural to
                                          conclude, that they may esteem, and venerate the intestines, as
                                          bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part. I have
                                          frequently held conversations on this subject, with a view to
                                          convince them, that all intellectual operations were carried on in
                                          the head; at which they would generally smile, and intimate, that
                                          they had frequently seen men recover whose skulls had been
                                          fractured, and whose heads had otherways been much injured; but
                                          that, in all cases in which the intestines had been wounded, the
                                          persons on a certainty died. Other arguments they would also
                                          advance in favour of their belief; such as the effect of fear, and
                                          other passions, which caused great agitation and uneasiness, and
                                          would sometimes produce sickness at the stomach, which they
                                          attributed intirely to the action of the bowels.

                                          longed for a pomegranate, tho' that fruit was not then in season.
                                          Ali went out, and diligently enquiring found a single one in the
                                          possession of a Jew. As he returned with it, a sick man met him and
                                          begged half the pomegranate, saying it would restore his health.
                                          Ali gave him half, and when he had eaten it, the man requested he
                                          would give him the other half, the sooner to complete his recovery.
                                          Ali benignantly complied, returned to his son and told him what had
                                          happened, and Hosein approved what his father had done.

                                          door was gently knocked at. He ordered the woman servant to go
                                          there, and she found a man, of all men the most beautiful, who had
                                          a plate in his hand covered with green silk, in which were ten
                                          pomegranates. The woman was astonished at the beauty of the man and
                                          of the pomegranates, and she took one of them and hid it, and
                                          carried the other nine to Aly, who kissed the present. When he had
                                          counted them he found that one was wanting, and said so to the
                                          servant, she confessed that she had taken it on account of its
                                          excellence, and Ali gave her her liberty. The Pomegranates were

                                          some Christian Saint, and falsely attributed to Ali. However this
                                          may be, it does not appear absurd that
