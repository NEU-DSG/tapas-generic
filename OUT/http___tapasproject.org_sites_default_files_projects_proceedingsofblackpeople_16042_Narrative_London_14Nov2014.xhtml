                           of a city trying out its role as forerunner of liberty 
                           in the new Republic. Striving printer and publisher Mathew Carey became the self-appointed
                           narrator of the epidemic, reporting what he 
                           witnessed, remediating anecdotes, and including lists of the recently deceased in
                           his multiple editions of 
                           <emph id="d56788e61">A Short Account of the

                           Carey’s depictions of the African American community. In 
                           <emph id="d56788e64">A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People</emph> (1794), they criticized 
                           Carey for his racist depictions of African Americans’ efforts to aid the sick and
                           the city generally in its time of great need and 
                           accounted for the many services their congregation at the Bethel AME Church had offered.

                        <p id="d56788e68">It is difficult to overstate the importance of this pamphlet: scholars such as Richard
                           Newman, Patrick Rael, and Phillip Lapsansky 
                           have deemed it the first piece of African American protest literature. Joanna Brooks
                           considers its significance as the first time 
                           that two formerly enslaved persons claimed copyright in the United States, writing
                           that “Copyright was a legal, if technical, means 
                           to rehumanizing the discourse and to reclaiming subjective authority in matters concerning
                           blackness” (
                           <emph id="d56788e70">American Lazarus: Religion and the Rise of African-American and Native American Literatures</emph>, 175). In my own research on intellectual,
                           or to use the 18C parlance, literary property in London, Dublin, and Philadelphia
                           in the eighteenth century, I also look to the pamphlet 
                           as a way to consider how Jones and Allen’s identities are partially mediated through
                           print, so that I can show that battles tied to books,
                           in both legal and cultural landscapes, refract those fought over the agency that comes
                           with citizenship and with establishing oneself as 
                           a viable force in a international marketplace created by empire. I see the pamphlet
                           as the way in which two former slaves who could not 
                           claim legal citizenship asserted their right to own rather than to be owned as they
                           gave material voice to their right to define the 
                           terms of representation for the African American community in the new Republic. My
                           methodology, which is largely grounded in book history 
                           and which insists on examinations of the transatlantic iterations of texts such as
                           Jones and Allen’s, led me to an exploration of the 
                           limitations placed on and opportunities possible in digital representation.

                        <p id="d56788e74">The yellow fever pamphlets—Carey’s, Jones and Allen’s, Dr. Benjamin Rush’s, just to
                           name a few—have received considerable attention from 
                           scholars of the early Republic looking to understand civil, racial, and national identity
                           in the first decade of the new nation. This 
                           fever was major: the worst epidemic the city had seen, the outbreak claimed the lives
                           of over 4,000 residents, about one tenth of the 
                           city’s total population. Many fled the urban scene of devastation as daily social
                           and economic life ceased, and squalor filled the streets.
                           This was a human-interest story extraordinaire, and these pamphlets recounting its
                           horrors sold, for they provided information to those 
                           inside of Philadelphia about family members, friends, and business contacts, and they
                           offered a chance for those outside of Philadelphia 
                           to visualize the gut-wrenching scenes of the troubled city. But, these pamphlets also
                           had an international appeal, though little to no 
                           attention has been paid to the transatlantic reprints. The scholarship on A Narrative
                           of the Proceedings of the Black People almost 
                           entirely ignores the London reprint of their pamphlet, thereby overlooking the pamphlet
                           as an early example of international abolitionist 
                           literature. The London publishing firm Darton and Harvey, Quakers with a bookshop
                           on Gracechurch Street, just a few doors down from the 
                           Meeting House, reproduced A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People in the
                           same year that it was printed in Philadelphia. 
                           Jones and Allen had presented their pamphlet to the Pennsylvania Abolition Society,
                           the world’s first organized antislavery group 
                           founded by Quakers, and presumably it was through the international Quaker network
                           that 
                           <emph id="d56788e76">A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black 
                              People
                           </emph> came to the attention of Darton and Harvey, who also reprinted Carey’s yellow fever
                           pamphlet. Darton and Harvey gave the pamphlet 
                           war between Carey and Jones and Allen, centered on local events in Philadelphia, an
                           international stage.  There is a distinct dearth of 
                           scholarship around this London reprint—Richard Newman is the only scholar to make
                           even scant mention of it in his impressive biography of 
                           Allen when he writes, “Carey's concern stemmed from the distribution of the black
                           duo's pamphlet in both America and Britain,” and says 
                           no more that transatlantic circulation. It is for this reason that I have decided
                           to edit the London edition of the pamphlet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56788e80">My first step was to get access to an encoded version of the Philadelphia edition.
                           <a href="http://www.18thconnect.org/" class="ref-external">18thConnect</a> made this possible through Typewright, 
                           a tool for correcting the text-version of a document made up of page images. Through
                           <a href="http://www.18thconnect.org/typewright/documents" class="ref-external"> Typewright</a>, I was able to correct the text-version 
                           of a document that Eighteenth-Century Collections Online has run through its Optical
                           Character Recognition (OCR), but has not been checked 
                           for machine errors. 18th Connect has worked out a deal with Gale Cengage, the company
                           that created ECCO: a user who corrects a complete work 
                           will receive the text version of that work, whether or not the user or her institution
                           holds an ECCO subscription. After I spent a few days 
                           correcting the OCR mistakes in A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People,
                           I received the machine encoded xml file of the Philadelphia 
                           edition. Through the help of the TEI classes offered by the <a href="http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/" class="ref-external">Women Writers’ Project</a>, I began the correcting of the encoding and the development 
                           of my own apparatuses to include. And through the <a href="http://www.tapasproject.org/" class="ref-external">TAPAS platform</a>, it appears here. As TAPAS developes, I hope to include images of the London edition
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d56788e95">In addition to offering the first digital surrogate of the London edition of this
                           pamphlet, I have also done substantial research into 
                           who the people mentioned in the pamphlet are. Using city directories for 1791, 1793,
                           1794, and 1795 (I could not locate a Philadelphia 
                           directory for 1792), I have created a personography that charts what these people
                           did and where they lived (often the same as where they lived). 
                           Using <a href="http://cartodb.com/" class="ref-external">CartoDB</a>, I created a map, which you will find at the end of the edition. I was able to match
                           the addresses given with the latitude and 
                           longitude by using a 1794 Philadelphia that provided cross streets. The reference
                           points are accurate within a given block. I have color coded 
                           the different years to note if and how people moved around. Be sure to hover over
                           any given dot as it will tell you who lived there in which year 
                           and what their occupation was listed as in the directory.
