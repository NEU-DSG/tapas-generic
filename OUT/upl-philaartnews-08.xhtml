                              and for its business management takes time. Heavy publication costs continue while
                              we are improving our results and while the community is beginning to credit our efforts.

                           <date id="d18997e222" when="--02-07">February 7</date> to 12, they have displayed one of the most unusual and most encouraging. The pictures
                           on view formed the 11th Annual Exhibition of the Business Men’s Art Club, a group
                           who devote their spare time to art, working under the direction of some eminent Philadelphia
                           artist, this year Justin Pardi.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e226">To criticize a group of such definitely amateur work is somewhat dangerous. One can
                           either praise it extravagantly, thinking only that it is remarkably good work for
                           a mere hobby; or one can be unduly censorious, judging the pictures solely on their
                           immediate merit, without taking any of the rather peculiar circumstances into consideration.
                           Fortunately, in this exhibition, neither extreme viewpoint had to be taken. The show
                           stood on its own merits.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e229">It had, as do all exhibitions, a varied range of achievement, but the average level
                           was that of good, honest painting. Working in charcoal, oil, water color, and pastel,
                           the fourteen men participating in the show recorded their feelings about events, scenes,
                           and people with a variety of manner. The nature of the individual artist came out
                           in subject and treatment. Francis B. Hall substantiated his interest in sporting life
                           with a series of riding and fishing scenes. Again, the personal vision of each artist
                           was demonstrated by comparing P. R. Loos’ “Classwork” and Carl Hassold’s “Nude”, both
                           based on the same model, attaining very different results.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e233">It is always difficult to select any one “best” picture. A number in this exhibit
                           were outstanding, among them: Wm. P. Lear’s group of four water colors, distinguished
                           by their sensitivity for place atmosphere; the portraits by Charles W. Bentz, particularly
                           that of “Miss McCauley”, finely designed both as to color and mass; David Faxon’s
                           charcoal studios; Oswald Chew’s water color, “Landscape”, a clear, simplified treatment
                           in which one feels an essential understanding of the medium. On the genre side, Carl
                           Hassold’s study in stylized forms and shadows “P.W.A.”, and H. Evan Taylor’s amusing
                           caricature “The Bishop” should have been noted.

                        <p id="d18997e248">The Federal Art Project is exhibiting at the Pennsylvania Museum in its print group
                           several carborundum tints. These prints were made by a new process which came out
                           of experiments of artists working in the Exhibition Print department only last month.
                           This group is under the direction of Richard Hood who offers the following explanation
                           of the process.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e251">“The Carborundum Tint is a copper plate process having, I believe, all the advantages
                           of the mezzotint with few of its disadvantages. Although there are still many collectors
                           of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century schools, few artists today are
                           interested in the mezzotint as a print medium, probably because the process is so
                           laborious that few artists can summon the great amount of time necessary to work the
                           plate before the design can even be started.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e254">It is possible to prepare a plate through the Carborundum process in a very short
                           time and to achieve blacks of greater richness and luminosity than those of the mezzotint,
                           producing a surface of an infinite number of minute pits and points which catch and
                           hold the ink when applied.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e258">The shiny copper plate is surfaced with carborundum and water by the use of a levigator.
                           The value of the tone desired can be controlled by the grade of carborundum used,
                           No. 80 grain being used for rich deep blacks while the finer grades of No. 120, No.
                           180, No. 220 or F can be used for plates requiring a more delicate tint. When the
                           design has been placed on the plate all the areas required to print lighter than the
                           black have to be scraped more or less strongly until, in order to produce a pure white,
                           the original surface has been regained. When complete, the plate is inked in the same
                           manner as an etching. This process produces a very durable plate which does not break
                           down in a large edition as the hard carborundum grains become embedded in the copper
                           and tend to strengthen the surface. This is not the case with the mezzotint where
                           the burr often starts to wear off after a small edition, unless the plate is steel
                           faced. Most print makers prefer printing from the copper surface rather than the less
                           receptive steel plating.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e261">The carborundum tint permits this and, I believe, also affords a surface allowing
                           a greater range of tone than the mezzotint. The interesting results which have been
                           achieved with the Carborundum Tint should lead to further exploration in this print
                           field.”

                           Herbert Hoover, Joseph Pennell, Lord Marley, and Jo Davidson, to Gloucester fishermen
                           and Ghetto tradesmen, his work carries much popular appeal.

                        <p id="d18997e319">Born in Austria in 1896, Margulies came to this country as a small boy. When he was
                           only fifteen he was already studying at the National Academy of Design during the
                           day and at Cooper Union at night. Later he worked under Joseph Pennell at the Art
                           Students’ League. At one time he was recipient of a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation
                           Fellowship.

                        <p id="d18997e322">Margulies believes that in order to make the American public art appreciative, art
                           should be based on human understanding as well as on intellectual creation.

                        <p id="d18997e326">Proficient in oil, water color, etching and aquatint, Margulies has participated in
                           many group shows and held various one man exhibits both here and on the Pacific Coast.
                           At present he has been invited to hold a one man exhibition at the Corcoran Galleries,

                           and novelties instead of forcing us to rely on foreign importations. Here are grouped
                           representative pieces from the studios of local glaziers, cabinet-makers, jewelers,
                           weavers, potters, wood-carvers, for the most part within the price-range of the average
                           person.

                           religious subjects. The techniques used have been as various as the subject matter.
                           Lawrence Saint, for “the Lord is My Shepherd” worked with Medieval colors, vibrant
                           reds, blues, and greens, in glass relatively thin; P. H. Balano composed his designs,
                           as “The Ram” or “Butterfly” in small, chunky pieces of almost pastel color. The D’Ascenzo
                           Studios, the Oliver Smith Studios, George W. Sotter, Duncan Niles Terry, and Henry
                           Lee Willet have also entered stained-glass.

                        <p id="d18997e355">The display of ceramics is large, with most of the prominent Philadelphia potters
                           represented. A white plate by Emily Swift, decorated with a simple, incised design
                           of conventionalized birds and a gun-metal lustre bowl by Caroline Granger are particularly
                           fine. Other potters include Mary Belle Barlow, Edmund de Forest Curtis, Emilie Zeckwer
                           Dooner, Prue M. Harris, Eleanor Pierce and Frances Serber.

                           Some of the loveliest pieces are those done in light amethyst. To this section, Richard
                           Bishop has contributed a clear glass cocktail shaker etched with a characteristic
                           wild fowl scene.

                           by The Davenports; the hand worked linens from the College Settlement Handicraft Shop;
                           and a rug by Cynthia Iliff. There are brilliant, hand-dyed batiks by Freda Macadam.

                        <p id="d18997e365">Woodcarving is divided between the grotesque little figures of William Lodge and the
                           elaborate, Renaissance type carving of A. Van Roelen. Mr. Lodge has used tree roots
                           of fantastic shape, allowing the nature of his material to determine the form of his
                           design, as in the highly amusing “frog”.

                           Rockwell. Furniture by Saybolt, Cleland &amp; Alexander includes a “Harrow” coffee table,
                           two “Trent” end tables, and two delightfully simple “Regency” chairs. Margaret Mellor
                           Gill exhibits several characteristic painted trays, while Henry Hagert has sent a
                           forcefully designed lighting fixture in silver and glass.

                        <p id="d18997e391">Having considered the vagaries surrounding the word “artist” in the minds of the public,
                           let us note certain misconceptions of the word “public” in the minds of artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e394">“Public” has almost as many meanings as there are those who use the term. To a politician
                           the public is a thing to be swayed—to the evangelist a thing to be saved. To the artist
                           it is too frequently a thing to be scorned.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e397">The “scorning” type of artist is, in fact, too numerous. He is too well known a type
                           to merit much special discussion—his ivory tower is impenetrable, and there he dwells
                           as blissfully as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e401">He fails to realize that, whether he be composer, writer, or artist, one of his primary
                           functions is to be articulate. And that this entails the presence of an audience—as
                           sympathetic as possible.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e404">To be sure, he is always human enough to enjoy favorable comment. This usually proceeds
                           from critics or fellow artists, and that, in his mind, is as it should be. As for
                           the public—well, who cares?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e407">When he deigns to mention the public, which is generally only under pressure, it is
                           with an eyebrow superciliously arched and a lip curled. This unfortunately, without
                           realizing that there has never existed a public more susceptible, potentially, to
                           fine things—if properly presented.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e410">The American people, taken en masse, have more native equipment to understand, and
                           more sympathy for the fundamental aspects of art than many artists, taken as individuals.
                           There is scarcely an enthusiasm they have that cannot be traced (sometimes obscurely)
                           to aesthetic impulses. Sports, motors and the movies are definite stepping stones
                           to pure aesthetic pleasure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e413">Consequently, it is the artist’s duty to iron out the supercilious arch of the eyebrow
                           no less than the curl of the lip, and get down to the serious business of reaching
                           his most worthy audience: the people of his own country.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e416">Naturally, this shall require more than a bit of facial laundering—a great deal of
                           patience will be necessary. The artist must be “big” enough to meet his audience half
                           way. The horse, being led to water, may not drink immediately, but he will eventually,
                           if one bears with him, for he must inevitably become thirsty.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e420">For that matter, the inevitable may not be so far away as is generally conceived,
                           providing the artist is willing to enlarge the windows of his ivory tower, to let
                           himself out and the public in.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e423">This public fellow is rather sensitive himself, at the moment. He has so frequently
                           been “put in his place” by artists that he is a little timid. And in many instances
                           the ill will occasioned in this manner has kept him from the galleries. And when it
                           has, the artist is by no means free from blame.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e426">So, Mr. Artist, get together with your potential friend Mr. Public, and before you
                           know it you’ll find that he’s more like yourself than you imagined. You’ll find much
                           in common with each other, and possibly before long he’ll be visiting galleries just
                           as he visits the movies.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e429">In a word, Mr. Public,—most of him, at any rate—is eager to accept Mr. Artist. He
                           instinctively likes to feel himself a part of the cultural life of his community,
                           if his friend Mr. Artist permits. Just give him a chance.

                        <p id="d18997e435">Walter Emerson Baum shows one of his smaller, but quite satisfying, winter landscapes;
                           Walter Gardner, in “Itinerary Incident”, waxes humorous with boys stealing a free
                           ride on the back of a truck; Grace Gemberling’s “The Barn” is a quiet, rural composition
                           with a well placed grazing horse; and Pemberton Ginther, in “The Convalescent”, has
                           created an expressive study of an emaciated youngster.

                        <p id="d18997e439">“Sunday Morning”, by William Goodell, has made striking use of unusual perspective—looking
                           down upon a youth who lies on the floor reading the “funnies”—a remarkable piece of
                           realism considering its not too realistic treatment. Margaretta S. Hinchman’s “Dryad”
                           is the most inventive canvas here, both composition and use of color line equally
                           fine; on the whole a stimulating canvas.

                        <p id="d18997e442">Francis Speight’s “Cotton Field” is replete with red-blooded color, and has fine compositional
                           completeness; Henry White Taylor contributes “Moving Light”, a poetic canvas in which
                           golden wheat-stacks sing against iridescent hills, with the conviction of space and
                           form paramount.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e445">“Model’s Lunch”, by Dorothy Van Loan, is good painting, not sweet, but strong in its
                           own angular way. Fred Wagner’s “Low Tide” is a large canvas of figures upon a beach,
                           devoid of detail, but of subtle, iridescent color. Charles W. Ward’s “Hod Carriers”
                           is one of the strongest pigmental comments in the show—it has enormous breadth and
                           lusty handling of paint. Edith Longstreth Wood shows a “Colorado Barnyard” light in
                           touch, pictorially effective.

                        <p id="d18997e448">Other notable canvases have been contributed by Yarnall Abbott, Mary Butler, Fern
                           I. Coppedge, John J. Dull, Furman J. Finck, Paul Gill, Sue May Gill, Caroline Gibbons

                        <p id="d18997e451">The finest sculpture comes from Aurelius Renzetti: “Negresco” and “Wisdom”; they are
                           rough in texture, simple in design and of exceptional strength. George H. Borst’s
                           “Boxer”, while of technical excellence, could be more dynamically expressive; William
                           M. Krusen’s best contribution is a “Boy’s Head” in which realistic character has been
                           achieved in a clean but not classic manner. Clara Bratt, Beatrice Fenton, Elizabeth
                           R. Pollock, Gladys Tuke and Adam Pietz complete the sculpture group.

                        <p id="d18997e454">Three exhibitions are running concurrently at the Philadelphia Art Alliance: oils
                           by Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones, the Second Annual Water Color Exhibition, and etchings
                           by George Constant.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e458">The Sparhawk-Jones canvases take their place among the most remarkable that we have
                           seen recently.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e461">One’s first impression, upon entering the first floor gallery, where these oils are
                           hung, is that of a highly individual color organization, remotely suggestive of Tintoretto.
                           In composition they are free almost to a fault, and, in draughtsmanship, given to
                           unusual accuracy. Upon close examination, however, they appear to be ruggedly accomplished
                           and have much tonal variety that is lost at a distance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e464">There is little that is idealic—mostly they are dramatic, as witness “The Big Catch”,
                           “Wild Animal Act”, “Circus Lady” and “Disaster”, all with a wealth of color masses
                           that move rapidly. Here is really a painter of academic tradition, but one who almost
                           bursts with a verve the moderns should like.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e467">The Second Annual Water Color Exhibition, on the second floor, is quite a sparkling
                           one. There is a lot of dash and juiciness in many of the contributions. Paul C. Burns,
                           J. Frank Copeland, Florence V. Cannon, Virginia Bates Dillmore, Salvatore Pinto and
                           Paul Gill show works that are fresh in color, free in handling and thoroughly in keeping
                           with the spirit of the medium. Particularly distinctive water colors come from Mabel
                           B. Hall, Carl Lindborg and Isabelle L. Miller.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e470">Likewise, a number of paintings may be found that have worked out their own salvation
                           without bending to the dictates of either technical or compositional convention. Carl
                           Shaffer, for example, shows an “Oedipus Complex”, spicily patterned and various materials
                           glued to the surface of the paper. “The Sailor’s Wife” by Emlen Etting, is most informal
                           in its handling and effective in composition. Kathleen Reilly has achieved free, dramatic
                           pattern in “Fishing Boats, Gloucester”; shades of Nicholas Roerich haunt the “Old
                           Mission Church at Talpa” by Katherine L. Farrell, and fantasy is rife in the “Rehearsal”
                           of Henry C. Pitz. Earle Miller, in “Back Stretch”, shows as great a flair for water
                           color as he has in the lithographic medium.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e473">Other contributors include Edith Longstreth Wood, Paul Froelich, Andrew Wyeth, Margaret
                           Gest, Thornton Oakley, Vera White, Biagio and Angelo Pinto, Thomas Flavell, Giovanni
                           and Antonio Martino, Katherine Schlater and Helen Lloyd.

                        <p id="d18997e477">The second floor print gallery is hung with etchings by George Constant who possesses
                           one of the most unusual pictorial idioms we have seen for quite a while. In point
                           of composition the artist has a rhythmic sense somewhat akin to that of Jean Charlot—a
                           way of simplifying forms and making them quite dynamic. Texturally they are most expressive
                           and, in a number of plates, the vignette principle has been used amusingly.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e480">Three well known local painters are showing their work at Philadelphia Women’s Clubs.
                           Nancy Ferguson holds forth at the Women’s University Club, while the Philomusian Club
                           and Women’s City Club are showing the work of Pearl Van Sciver and Gladys M. G. West,
                           respectively.
                        </p>

                           <head id="d18997e487">“The Big Catch” by Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones</head>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e491">We remember, several years ago reviewing an exhibit of Miss Ferguson’s paintings in
                           which we declared the painter’s most prominent characteristic to be an “antiquity
                           of effect”. That cannot be said of this group. We sense, from these paintings, which
                           we hope are recent, a decided growth in the artist—greater tonal variety, more general
                           zest, color and surfaces that are not too “precious”; withal, more compelling paintings.
                           Compositionally, the painter has changed little—roofs and roads still cluster themselves,
                           sometimes too luxuriantly, within the canvases. But we have, nevertheless, a generous
                           quantity of strong painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e494">The canvases of Pearl Van Sciver and Gladys M. G. West have considerably more in common
                           with each other than with the Ferguson works. Both possess a palette grayish in key
                           and a compositional sense that is conventional but mature. Miss West leans more decidedly
                           in the direction of the decorative. Pearl Van Sciver’s most effective offerings are
                           quaint European towns, delicately and rather dramatically handled.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e497">Two artists are currently represented at the Print Club—Henry C. Pitz and Paul Cushing
                           Child. The former shows lithographs and etchings together with a number of preliminary
                           drawings for some of the prints; from the latter come lithographs and wood cuts, some
                           in color.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e501">A decided contrast is furnished by the two personalities. Pitz is eternally active
                           and dramatic, concentrating generally upon rugged characterization of men of the great
                           out-of-doors and accomplishing his effect with an abundance of verve. It is likewise
                           of great interest to compare his sketches with the finished prints.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e504">Child, who, in addition to landscape and architectural subjects, frequently eyes his
                           fellow man, is invariably the decorative, rather than emotional artist. Textures of
                           surfaces and shadows are delicately wrought composition static but well balanced.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e507">Conrad Roland is showing water colors of American birds at Charles Sessler’s.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e510">Roland obviously loves his birds, for not a detail concerning them has escaped him.
                           He lingers most affectionately over the finesse of their feathers, and interprets
                           beautifully the feel and character of them no less than their delicate hues, which
                           have been matched with great care.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e513">Pictorially they vary, in a remarkable way, from simple delineation of the bird upon
                           white paper, with no background, to elaborate compositions of trees and foliage, wherein
                           as much attention has been lavished upon the background as upon the picture’s winged
                           subject.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e516">Roland has a definite flair for small surfaces and delicate textures, and in these
                           studies he has been happily in his element.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e520">An engaging exhibit of the work of Nicola D’Ascenzo is to be found at the Fine Arts
                           Building of the University of Pennsylvania.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e523">Included are oils, pastels and drawings, plus a number of cartoons for stained glass
                           and some of the finished products of his studio.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e526">In his figure work D’Ascenzo reveals a direct affinity with the Golden Age of Italian
                           painting, but the finished work has a greater superficial resemblance to that produced
                           by the late Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The spirit of Dante Gabriel Rosetti drifts
                           through a number of these.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e529">When creating landscape or studies of water, this influence gives way to a soft, iridescent
                           sort of impressionism, much freer in treatment. The stained glass designs should be
                           of great interest to the layman.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e532">Hirshman, whose caricatures are to be seen at the A. C. A. Gallery, has wedded his
                           genuine ability in this direction to another: that of taking one object and making
                           another out of it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e535">As a result of this clever process a slice of toast, for instance, combined with a
                           fried egg, a piece of bacon, a pretzel and some spinach becomes a delightful caricature
                           of the Duke of Windsor. The Duchess is with him—made of beads and whatnot. Leon Trotsky’s
                           hair is nothing more than a mop, Joseph Stalin is uniformed with dresser drawers,
                           has a brush for hair, a comb for a mustache, etc., while John D. Rockefeller, Sr.
                           has a dime for an eye. So it goes, and they are all ingenious. Other caricatures fashioned
                           in this way include Hitler, Mussolini, Harpo, Groucho and Salassie.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e539">There are likewise a number of caricatures accomplished only by painting, in which
                           no “properties” are used.

                        <p id="d18997e542">The exhibition of prints by Joseph Margulies, now at the Carlen Galleries, includes
                           etchings, aquatints and one lithograph.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e545">They are mostly heads, rather dramatically—sometimes romantically—handled. While some
                           of these prints are quite fine, they do not, on the whole, share equal excellence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e548">The best of the group are “Meditation No. II”, “From the Ghetto”, “Reb-Schmeal”, “Resignation”,
                           “Homeless Philospher”, and “Gloucester Fisherman”. In each of the plates there is
                           a broad, eloquent vision and sympathetic portrayal of mankind.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e551">There are a number of landscapes and harbor studies, the best of which are “Windblow
                           Tree”, decorative in a Japanesque way, and rather simple in composition; and “Sospel
                           Bridge”, an effective vignette.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e554">The solitary lithograph is one of the best of the portraits: “Over a Glass of Tea”.
                           One wonders why this artist has not turned more frequently to lithography, in view

                        <p id="d18997e564">Andrew Wyeth, whose portrait “Charlie Ervine” is reproduced as the insert for this
                           issue, was born in Chadds Ford in 1917. Son of the well-known painter, N. C. Wyeth,
                           young Andrew did his first drawings at the age of four. He has worked chiefly in black
                           and white, oil, and water color.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e567">Of “Charlie Ervine,” he says: “This picture is my first attempt at portraiture in
                           egg tempera, although I have done quite a few landscapes in this medium. I painted
                           this portrait from life and out of doors, in Port Clyde, Maine. While I was working
                           on it, the fishermen going by would see me mixing the egg to paint with, and ask me
                           whether I was making a cake.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e570">Mr. Wyeth has exhibited at the Art Alliance, the Chicago Art Centre, and last fall
                           held a very successful one-man show at the Macbeth Gallery, New York City. He has
                           recently been invited to show at the Whitney Museum.

                        <p id="d18997e839">Dear Dr. Barnes:</p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e842">The Barnes Foundation possesses perhaps the most important accumulation of Modern
                           Art in the world. Furthermore it was assembled by the discriminating taste of an individual,—yourself.
                           This latter fact is as significant as the Barnes Foundation itself, for without the
                           element of personal selection, it is doubtful whether the collection would be vital.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e846">William H. Vanderbilt demonstrated the foolhardiness of following the advice of dealers,
                           critics, and connoisseurs rather than using intelligent personal taste in the formation
                           of a collection fifty years ago. It is now recognized that the fashionable “masterpieces”
                           chosen by his advisers have little aesthetic worth.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e849">The collections of Huntingdon, Mellon, and Bache do not enter into this thought inasmuch
                           as they have assembled chiefly historic examples by long recognized masters or schools.
                           Hence their collections are reference libraries of art, more useful as cultural stimuli
                           than as generators of contemporary creative expression.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e852">Because of the unique character and potential value of your collection as a stimulation
                           for contemporary production of art, it could render enormous service to the art community
                           if it were open to the public. Artists who now find it impossible to gain access to
                           the Barnes Foundation would come to be inspired. Potential collectors would be encouraged
                           to follow your example in fearlessly purchasing contemporary art, thus providing a
                           badly needed support to the art industry which totters feebly in the strong tide of
                           depression.

                           of those laymen who are endeavoring to enrich their appreciation of art. I urge you
                           to open the doors of the Foundation to the public for at least one-half day a week.

                        <p id="d18997e876">Your letter of 
                           <date id="d18997e878" when="--01-25">January 25</date> confirms the opinion I formed of you by reading the stupid, ignorant, gossipy, sensation-hunting
                           “tripe” published in your paper; in other words, you hope to climb out of the intellectual
                           and commercial slums by pandering to the ignorant, uninformed tribe that infests the
                           fringe of art. If, in that adventure, you think you can make use of me or the institution
                           which I founded, “go to it” and do your damnedest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e882">So much for what I believe you represent, and so much also for what I think you mean,
                           but have neither the honesty nor the guts to say, by your effusions. Now, I’ll answer
                           what you do say in your letter, ignoring the maudlin bootlicking you give me in the
                           fourth paragraph. . .

                        <p id="d18997e885">Your statement that you write “on behalf of all those painters who are sincerely trying
                           to create works of art, and of those laymen who are endeavoring to enrich their appreciation
                           of art”—all that, viewed in the light of actual facts, makes it pretty clear that
                           you are either a colossal ignoramus or a demonstrable liar.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e889">Your plea that our gallery be opened even once a week to your hypothetical group,
                           displays gross ignorance of the purposes of our project, of the decisions of the Courts
                           that it is not a public gallery but an educational institution, that every day from
                           sunrise to sunset the gallery is occupied in carrying out a systematic educational
                           program, that every class is filled to capacity, and that we have a waiting list of
                           several hundred desirable students who cannot be accommodated because every available
                           place is occupied by earnest, intelligent persons.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e892">Furthermore, your stupid plea to have casual visitors interrupt an already over-crowded
                           program that has been endorsed as uniquely valuable by the leading authorities in
                           education, was faced and answered many years ago: you can find a record of it on page
                           191 et seq. of a volume entitled “Art and Education,” published by the Barnes Foundation
                           Press, price $2. And the validity of that answer you will find confirmed by the decision
                           of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, dated 
                           <date id="d18997e894" when="1934-01-30">January 30, 1934</date>.

                           want a fight, this reply is a good opening. At any rate, your letter furnished justifiable
                           grounds for expressing the utter contempt I have for everything that you and your
                           journal represent and to issue a challenge to you and your fellow mental and artistic
                           cripples to carry the matter further.

                        <p id="d18997e914">Your accusations imply that we have exaggerated both the value of the collection controlled
                           by the Barnes Foundation and your importance as a collector. If, not having seen your
                           complete collection, we have so exaggerated, then we grant that we are an ignoramus
                           (as, indeed, who is not!) It cannot truthfully be said, however, that we are a liar
                           unless this should be demonstrated by the physical results over a reasonable period,
                           say fifteen years, of having the Barnes Foundation opened to the public as per our
                           suggestion.

                        <p id="d18997e917">In spite of your modest disclaimers, stated or implied, we still feel that the collection
                           of the Barnes Foundation could render enormous service to the art community precisely
                           as outlined to you in our first letter.

                        <p id="d18997e920">We recognize that the purposes of your project are private and we do not feel that
                           it is pertinent to inform ourselves as to what those aims are. We were not aware,
                           however, of any court decision which compels the Barnes Foundation to remain closed
                           to the public. We believe that a study of the court decisions will inform you that
                           you have a legal right to open the Foundation to the public for brief periods at stated
                           intervals, if you so choose to do.

                        <p id="d18997e923">This course is suggested to you, not as an interruption of “an already overcrowded
                           program,” but as a supplement thereto. Its accomplishment would require administrative
                           capacity which we trust you possess.

                           we believe we have said enough to make ourself clear. We should be very happy indeed

                           in Philadelphia”. The following letter gives one hearer’s reaction to this talk.

                        <p id="d18997e951">I paid to hear your talk and I’m not bound to be polite, but may follow your advice
                           and examine what I buy. I find I rather like your platform manner as the people’s
                           friend. I am very interested in your statements and their range and am also impressed
                           with the free floating emotional response of your audience. I sniffed a revival atmosphere
                           recalling to mind that other famous ball tosser Mr. Sunday, until I was quite sure
                           you must have read “How to Make Friends and Influence People.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e954">That is very unlikely. With the rudimentary tact of Carnegie, you would find yourself
                           unable to attack Miss Curran, as your pickets do.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e958">I like all you said about tradition which is anyhow one thing we share; but your moving
                           talk did not get me going, not after you explained about the guinea pigs. I have been
                           called an ass by a man who is now dead; but if I am a guinea pig, you are another,
                           and I must look at you as (let us assume) one guinea pig sizes up another. First off,
                           you are older, and retired; with what for a lower animal would be some very odd possessions.
                           Next, now that you are a guinea pig hors de combat life has for you the simpler pleasure
                           of leisure activity. That is why you exaggerate the game of base ball into an art
                           form. You annoy all guinea pigs who are too busy as guinea pigs trying to remain alive
                           when you direct our attention to Connie Mack, who is a publicly supported institution
                           though not tax free.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e961">Do you know you quite stuck your neck out when you defined art. Traditionally one
                           can’t get away with it and no more can you. The limit you imposed excluded (as no
                           exact definition may) the recognized artistic qualities implicit in the words “Imitation,”
                           “Artifice,” “Creation,” banned most of “abstraction” and all of “iconography,” and
                           hardly left a leg for all the poets to stand on. Is it scientific to discard so much
                           related matter because you, like many another aesthetic, have a “tic”?
                        </p>

                           of Art, if tried like a coat on Thomas Craven, would make him look very much like
                           an artist, and be most becoming to his type of Beauty.

                           sometimes I find I am way ahead of you, though I do agree with much you say. “Bergson
                           once said that one moment of intuition preceded twelve volumes of philosophy.” You
                           make no room for intuition in your way of life. Is it because your flow of analysis
                           before your paintings does not equal twelve volumes of philosophy?

                           distaste, invariably failed to recognize each other, were introduced at a large afternoon
                           tea. One is a bachelor; the other was accompanied by his lovely wife.

                           incorporated under the same type of charter and, having the same end in view, propose
                           to govern themselves in the same manner as the original society—which undoubtedly
                           achieved the acme of art encouragement in an earlier America.

                           allotting works of art to the members of the Art Union, on Friday evening, 
                           <date id="d18997e1071" when="1849-12-21">December 21, 1849</date>. The event marked the close of a decade of activities designed to further the cause
                           of art in America. Skirts billowing top-hats set at a rakish angle, men and women
                           eagerly scrutinized slips of paper on which were recorded membership numbers. “Does
                           the number called off from the platform for the painting on view, correspond with
                           the one in my hand? Is this painting to be mine?” was the question in every mind.

                        <p id="d18997e1075">Amazing was the speedy development of the original visionary plan. From a membership
                           of 686 in 1840, it grew to the astonishing number of 18,960 by 1849, receipts in that
                           year amounting to $96,300. Conceived in the mind of John W. Francis to “bring to the
                           aid of struggling art, the advantages of associated effort,” it allotted a grand total
                           of 36 paintings valued at $3000 at the end of its first year. The successful expansion
                           of the organization was credited to the large and active group of honorary secretaries,
                           which embraced in its number of over 600 (in 1849), “some of the most intelligent,
                           refined, and active spirits of our country.” These secretaries were scattered over
                           a wide area, and represented such distant states as Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Mississippi,
                           and Texas, the latter having been annexed to the United States only four years before.

                           guests as the Minister of the French Republic, Major Poussin attended. On the walls
                           were displayed the recent purchases of the Art Union, soon to be allocated at the
                           annual drawing. They included one which had received top price ($1500) “The Wages
                           of War”, also one by George Inness ($600) which showed “marked improvement” over previous
                           work.

                           of murals illustrating “Quaker History”. Eight in number, the panels represent various
                           phases of the Quaker movement from the life of its seventeenth century founder, George
                           Fox, to the establishment of the American Friends’ Service Committee in 1917. The
                           work was done under the supervision of Hobson Pittman, instructor in art, but the
                           actual planning and painting was done by the students.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1135">The murals were done on composition board, each panel having to be twice painted in
                           opaque color to ensure adequate covering of the rough surface of the board. As they
                           stand now, the general impression of the color is of decisiveness without harshness.
                           As befits the essentially functional nature of mural painting, the design of the panels
                           is pre-eminently architectural. Almost exact symmetry is frequently used, as in the
                           first, “George Fox, The Founder of Friends”. Great simplification of both figures
                           and color is another characteristic.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1138">A great deal of the research necessary for historical accuracy was done by the students
                           themselves. However, inasmuch as the time spent on the murals was comparatively short,
                           additional information was given by a committee of parents and faculty, headed by
                           Esther C. Jones. The material thus obtained, though, was completely assimilated by
                           the students and was incorporated in their work in a vital manner. An example of this
                           can be seen in the panel “Period of Quietism, 1725–1825”. A certain lecturer had spoken
                           of the Quakers’ hedging themselves in from the rest of the world; the student responsible
                           for the composition of this panel has used a symbolic rectangular hedge as the principle
                           agent in the design.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1142">The original impetus for the murals was the decision made by the Philadelphia Friends
                           for each Quaker school in this vicinity to contribute some exhibit to be shown at
                           the Germantown Friends’ Conference. The murals were the project assigned to Friends’
                           Central. So successful was it, that two of the panels, “Separation”, largely done
                           by Virginia Stoll and Virginia Griscom, and “The American Friends’ Service Committee”,
                           the work of John F. Kleinz, Jr., Katherine J. Howell, and Ruth Massey, were reproduced
                           in the London Friends’ Magazine.

                           felt the need, so we spoke to the science department, and gradually we got under way.
                           We made a few rules which we all agreed to adhere to.

                           three rules will seem old stuff, but there are plenty of our schools which could use
                           them well. The grand part of this program is that a wonderful amount can be accomplished
                           for very little money.

                        <p id="d18997e1271">We’ve only started in a small way, but already we’ve done two three foot maps for
                           the astronomy room and are working on an eight foot square zodiac for a ceiling picture
                           in the same room. For the geology room next door we’ve started a series of panels
                           showing the various geologic ages to supplement the specimen cases.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1274">We plan to refurnish all the class rooms in such a way that each room will become
                           not only a place to recite one’s lesson but also a place where one can study comfortably.
                           We’ve installed in some of the rooms comfortable chairs, library tables, and bookshelves.
                           There are to be cases for travelling exhibits, and, if possible, curtains at the windows.
                           We believe that if the student is placed in such surroundings he will not only take
                           advantage of what is there but will do all in his power to improve it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1277">After the class rooms are taken care of, the halls are to be decorated with paintings
                           directly on the walls. We’ve one 10 by 12 foot world map started outside the geography
                           room and if it proves successful from both pupil’s and instructor’s standpoints, we
                           plan to do more.

                        <p id="d18997e1280">What I wish to stress in all this is that the work is student work and the exhibits
                           are either student made or student loaned. As I said, it’s only a start, but we feel
                           it’s one in the right direction.

                           through complete liberty of subject and material; where the technique attains Academy
                           standards—such classes sound utopian, but as a matter of fact they are realities.
                           The children’s and adults’ art classes at the Settlement Music School are based upon
                           these ideas.

                        <p id="d18997e1292">The primary objective of the Settlement Music School has, as the very name indicates,
                           been the teaching of music. But some eight years ago, it was decided to start a children’s
                           art class on Saturday morning, principally to keep the children busy while waiting
                           for their various music classes. Antonio Cortizas, then a student at the Pennsylvania
                           Academy of Fine Arts, volunteered to teach the class. It occupied two small rooms
                           at the back of a vacant house next door. Since that time, the number of classes has
                           been multiplied by five—there are three children’s classes on Saturday mornings and
                           classes for adults Monday and Friday evenings—and in place of the two small rooms,
                           the art students now have the large basement studio of the School building.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1295">Classes for children include instruction in sketching, water color, modelling, and,
                           this year, for the first time, oils. The results of this most recent innovation have
                           been more than successful. The children are using oils with originality and vitality.
                           One little boy in particular, evidently an ardent admirer of horses, has done several
                           oil sketches of horses in a broad, form-achieving manner that shows unusual understanding
                           of the medium in which he is working. Sculpture, for the younger groups, is confined
                           to modelling small figures and groups in clay—washerwomen, Goldilocks at her table,
                           strange and familiar animals—These are then colored and shellacked to simulate pottery.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1298">The older students do a great deal of sketching, occasionally in the newly-formed
                           life classes, clay modelling and direct stone carving, and murals.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1302">All of the art work done at the school is primarily of an experimental nature. The
                           greatest possible freedom is given to the student, the main idea being to bring out
                           a living quality. Technique comes later. But the School wishes to avoid any charge
                           of fostering dilettantism. The students are given thorough training. Three of this
                           year’s class have been admitted to the Academy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e1305">Once every year an exhibition of the School’s work is held at Broad and Spruce Streets,
                           and has always aroused interest and enthusiasm among the public. Last year between
                           twelve and thirteen thousand people visited the show.

                           development. This has been brought about through a necessity for safety leading to
                           a slow accumulative knowledge through experimentation. The result of all this is a
                           form of great beauty. It is almost perfect functional design. This has been not quite
                           so true in the development of the train. Overnight a complicity of wheels and stacks
                           has been housed in shining simplicity. It is true that this simplicity gave to the
                           train greater speed with less power. It is true that the “airflow” resulting from
                           this design gave a greater actual as well as apparent safety. But all of this was
                           not so much a matter of slow functional growth as in the airplane. It was more a matter
                           of aesthetics.

                           a consciousness made active in us because of a sense of rightness and fitness in the
                           form of an airplane.

                              to craftsmanship. In doing this we can observe how, from the primitive period there
                              gradually evolved different techniques whose influence and quick acceptance actually
                              created schools of painting. The four main periods of art might be classified as follows:
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1431">1st. The early orientals, Egyptians, Incas, and Mayas in which we find “Truth of Contour”.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1434">2nd. Classical and Medieval Epochs, up to the beginning of the 15th C. To the 12th
                              C., Germany is the chief European center. From 1150 to 1300, Central France with the
                              Gothic movement, takes the lead. Italy remains in the background until 1250. Here,
                              as in the next period, we find “Truth of Form”.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1437">3rd. The 15th and 16th centuries, The High Renaissance.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1441">4th. Beginning of the 17th C., in Flanders, Holland, Spain, France, England and America.
                              We now have “Truth of Space”. We may even, perhaps, add a fifth period, beginning
                              with the exhibition in Paris in 1871 where the moderns first disturbed art’s serene
                              tranquillity and have, ever since, caused gnashing of teeth, furor and excitement.
                              Like a quickly growing tree, from the original school of Impressionism rapidly branched
                              the Post Impressionists, these again dividing into groups of Futurists, Sur-Realists,
                              Dadaists, Les Fauves, who then give us the Ecole de Paris and Expressionism.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1444">In discussing the various schools of painting, we will not adhere to chronological
                              sequence but rather to the influences of the evolving techniques. We will, therefore,
                              omit references to painting before that of the Florentines, as the craftsmanship was
                              not developed to a degree of sufficient importance, with the exception, however, of
                              some of the early Grecian and Roman frescoes. This technique we will discuss briefly
                              when considering the Buon Fresco of the High Renaissance.

                           <p id="d18997e1447">Giotto (b. 1267—d. 1337) may be considered as the father of modern painting. Using
                              the new technique, which his master Cimabue had brought from Greece, namely, tempera,
                              Giotto becomes a powerful influence. Shaking off the shackles of Byzantinism, he inspires
                              a new movement, introducing more freedom of treatment luminosity, and greater realism.
                              We still, however, recognize the influence of fresco on the early Florentine easel
                              paintings. The picture, as a whole, is light in key, with the shadows lacking the
                              deep values so characteristic of the later schools.

                           <p id="d18997e1450">It may be of interest to pause here and explain just what is meant when the word “tempera”
                              is so frequently used in connection with the Florentine and later periods. Tempera
                              is the name given that technique in which, at first, the egg was used as the active
                              principle in binding the pigments as a paint on the surface to be decorated. Vasani
                              about 1550 and Cennino Cennini about 1442 give us a detailed description of this method.
                              Generally, the yolk was employed together with water as a medium. Pigments ground
                              in this solution yielded colors of a very short, buttery consistency, drying quickly
                              with a mat, opaque finish. In this medium, it is possible to paint in extremely fine
                              and accurate detail. Water is used as a vehicle to thin the colors while painting
                              Panels were prepared with a white, so-called, Gesso ground, composed of mixtures of
                              glue size and precipitated chalk, gypsum, china clay or plaster of Paris. On these
                              white, absorbent grounds, the painting was first drawn or painted in “grisaille”,
                              a grey monochrome, and further painted and modelled in white and colors over an underpainting
                              in which Terre Verte (a green earth pigment) and verdaccio (a green mixed tone prepared
                              of Black, White, Ochre or Light Sienna) was used. Sometimes, the entire egg content
                              was used, the white of the egg also being employed in the laying of gold leaf, which
                              was in many instances laid over large areas, backgrounds or entire skies.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1453">The finished paintings were then given an application of a varnish, the hand sometimes
                              being used to rub on the varnish in place of a brush. Cennini mentions the use of
                              bodied Linseed Oil, (sun thickened and heat tested) and a liquid varnish prepared
                              of linseed oil and resin. With the typical warm reddish tone of their varnishes, the
                              effect of a warm glaze over the otherwise rather cool tempera painting was obtained.

                        <p id="d18997e1616">Sid Quinn, a recent Industrial Art graduate, took several friends on a junket to New
                           York to visit Nicholas Riley, illustrator who has a studio in Tudor City. Riley, who
                           has crashed the big time in the past year, has had an interesting upward march. Trained
                           as a painter, he developed a flair for eating three times a day. For a while he indulged
                           in drawing still lifes for a plumbing concern, and that as you may know, is pretty
                           still. He gradually worked up to illustrating for pulps of the hectic bang-bang school,
                           and varied this with work from advertising agencies. The final achievement was a series
                           of illustrations for The Woman’s Home Companion, which proved that all those years
                           of workful waiting were not in vain. Riley, a gracious host, yarned with his young
                           friends for a whole afternoon and the tyros returned home with the look of men who
                           mean business.

                        <p id="d18997e1655">Conversations with both art students and some professionals around town led us to
                           believe that there are more people engaged in art work who are not informed on sources
                           of work than we had imagined. There are of course two places where these sources are
                           listed. The publication which lists advertising agency personnels, is not so easily
                           obtained, and the subscription price is prohibitive to the average art student. To
                           put it more bluntly, the price probably has the same effect on lots of professionals.
                           The one source that is readily accessible and which is used by everyone, is the old
                           reliable handbook put out by Mr. Bell Telephone and his gang. But here again we run
                           up against difficulties. One finds that he or she is constantly running into duds.
                           The term “dud” is not used disparagingly; we simply mean that said duds are places
                           not to go. (Typical dud; a publisher’s representative who is listed under “Advertising”
                           in the directory, but who is not authorized by his employer to buy art-work. Of course
                           there is always the chance that he may want a monogram designed for his own handkerchief,
                           so suit yourself.)

                        <p id="d18997e1658">The second reason for this column is that while many of you may know the places to
                           go, you are in a complete fog as to the name of the art directors at these places.
                           There’s some sort of psychological effect on yourself that rises from being able to
                           walk into an agency and nonchalantly reel off the art director’s name. Besides giving
                           you self-confidence, it sometimes impresses the girl at the switchboard. At any rate,
                           mentioning the A. D.’s name immediately enlightens her as to your mission and eliminates
                           the awkward explanation of why you’re there.

                           made the central motif a West Indies scene as viewed through a porthole. This was
                           done on a circle of celluloid in transparent oils, much the same process as that used

                           from $2.25 to $36.00. While these look dangerous, they operate on the scizzors principle
                           which make it difficult for the user to inflict serious personal injury. When you
                           get a cutting board be sure it has a metal cutting edge against which the knife-lever

                           Zip-A-Tone which goes on like Frisket Paper. More than 200 varieties of screen for
                           line reproduction are to be had. Use of Zip-A-Tone where practicable would materially
                           reduce the cost of plates in which Ben Day is ordinarily used.

                           for that fell purpose. It’s the man behind the box that does the trick, plus opportunity
                           and the given moment.

                        <p id="d18997e1830">The label of candid camera applied indiscriminately to all those cute little minnies
                           is a misnomer. They have their points, and are handy little gadgets to have around
                           all right, but their big brothers are just as good at swiping that fleeting expression.
                           It’s up to the boss.

                        <p id="d18997e1833">Many pictures are sniped when the sniped are unaware of the sniping. The size of the
                           camera is immaterial. The popular belief that the victim is blissfully ignorant of
                           the proximity of a small camera pointed directly at him is a fallacy. Big or little
                           he knows it’s no machine gun.

                        <p id="d18997e1836">On the other hand numerous successful candid camera pictures have been obtained from
                           unposed shots. While aware of the lurking camera, the subject doesn’t know just when
                           the shot did or shall occur. This sort of candid photography permits effecting effective
                           lighting. The accompanying picture is an example.

                           <p id="d18997e1898">After the games were over I returned to America for a while, but the nostalgia for
                              the boulevards lined with shady horse chestnut trees and cozy sidewalk cafes, spring
                              in the Bois, leisurely bookstalls fledging the indolent Seine and the lure of Adventure
                              in foreign lands soon proved too much for me. I just grabbed a handful of boat and
                              landed at Bordeaux with a roving commission to open a Paris bureau for the Acme Newspictures.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1901">France at that time was in a political turmoil and cabinets were falling and reforming
                              and falling again with unflagging regularity. I instructed my “femme de menage” to
                              awaken me each morning with my breakfast tray, mail, the information as to what day
                              it was, the weather, and did France have a new Cabinet? Because if France did have
                              a new over-night cabinet I had to do something about getting their pictures. Arrangements
                              had been made with a well known French photographic service to supplement the supply
                              of pictures for my bureau. They had a staff of ten or twelve cameramen that I utilized
                              and assigned whenever necessary and I generally depended on them to cover such routine
                              matters as pictures political. They hadn’t the faintest idea of the importance of
                              speedy transportation and would stare at me in amazement when I appeared at their
                              office at eight o’clock in the morning demanding pictures they had shot the day before.
                              I just Simon Legree’d ’em until I got pictures in time for the nine o’clock boat train,
                              translating their French captions into English while taxiing to the Gare St. Lazare.
                              But they soon learned. The French government, on the other hand, was well aware of
                              our methods of rapid transportation as they demonstrated when they seized the pictures
                              of the fatal Eiffel Tower airplane flight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1904">A French army officer went the rounds of the moving picture companies in Paris offering
                              to fly through the Eiffel Tower for a few thousand francs as a picture stunt. The
                              American movie companies refused to touch it as they knew the flight was against the
                              law and that the pilot could not get a permit for such a risky venture. The idea was
                              intriguing, nevertheless, and finally a prominent French cinema company offered to
                              go halves with an American syndicate and they decided to go ahead with it with the
                              greatest of secrecy. The Americans planned to have one of their cameramen in the plane
                              turning out film as the ship swooped through the base of the tower. They also placed
                              cameras on the ground to cover all angles. Fortunately for the photographer who was
                              to fly, the French pilot vetoed that part of it at the last minute as he feared the
                              risk of discovery if army officials saw him entering a plane with a cameraman and
                              his apparatus at the army field.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1907">Everything was ideal for the flight as the morning selected dawned clear and mild.
                              A minute or so before the scheduled time cameras appeared from nowhere in particular
                              and were soon in position as the plane droned leisurely in the sky and circled above
                              the tower. Presently it dipped and came down in a beautiful dive, roaring triumphantly
                              through the steel ribbed arch with plenty of space to clear while the cameras ground
                              out pictures. Then sudden tragedy. As the plane emerged from the other side a wing
                              caught in some unperceived radio wires and the ship whirled and crashed to the pavement.
                              In a fraction of a second it was such a roaring mass of flames no one dared approach
                              to attempt a rescue. The pilot perished as the photographers automatically cranked
                              and clicked away.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1911">The first fast boat leaving then was the Paris, and the films were rushed aboard only
                              to be confiscated at sea by orders of the French government. Had they been placed
                              on any other boat but a French liner the officials would have been powerless to seize
                              the films, but the Paris was the first to sail.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1914">Being more or less a lone wolf, so to speak, I would never leave Paris to cover a
                              story until the last minute. My assistant remained behind to keep an eye on things
                              in general and expedite the transportation of pictures relayed to him. On the occasion
                              of the funeral of the famous war-time prelate, Cardinal Mercier, I arrived in Brussels
                              the night before, too late to get a press pass from the Burgomeister. I was not particularly
                              worried about that, however, as I knew that the first to get on the spot always wangled
                              a few extra passes—just in case. So when I arrived at the Hotel Metropole I found
                              the crowd foregathered in the cafe and after the usual kidding and numerous Belgian
                              beers I soon found myself in possession of the coveted bit of cardboard. Noblesse
                              oblige.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1917">I instructed the night clerk to ring me at nine the next morning as the funeral started
                              at ten at the Gare du Nord. He neglected to do so, and upon awakening myself and consulting
                              my watch I found it was just ten o’clock. Helas! I flung myself into my clothes and
                              realizing it was too late to shoot the start of the procession at the Gard du Nord
                              I grabbed a taxi and told the chauffeur to take me to the cathedral. The closest we
                              could possibly get to if was three blocks away from it, so clutching my camera and
                              waving my pass I tried desperately to push through the solid crowd of spectators thronging
                              the street. I have fought my way successfully through New York crowds, Paris crowds
                              and London crowds, but this mass of stolid Belgians had me licked. It was no go. Three
                              blocks of massed humanity wedged cheek by jowl between me and the cathedral, held
                              in check there by rows of troops, their bayonettes gleaming in the sun. Lampposts,
                              balconies, yes—and chimneypots too, cluttered with human freight. The cathedral flowing
                              lacily into the sky. A magnificent sight. I decided that this was the picture after
                              all. I saw the movie men run to the steps of the cathedral and set up their tripods.
                              Royalty and Diplomacy, whose gorgeous uniforms vied with the splendor of ecclesiastical
                              robes mounted the long flight of steps and were engulfed in the sable draped doorway.
                              The catafalque arrived and as the casket was carried slowly and reverently up the
                              steps, I raised my camera high above my head and standing on tiptoe made five shots.
                              Here was the picture that told the whole story. Here all the color and pageantry,
                              the cathedral, the casket, troops and crowds. The other pictures I had missed, of
                              the procession, the Prince of Wales and King Leopold in line of march, meant nothing
                              compared with this. I bought all those pictures anyway for a song one hour later at
                              the local newspapers. Syndicates don’t care who click the pictures just so they get
                              them. One man can’t be in two places at once.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d18997e1920">Along with the rest of the boys I got my pictures off next morning from Paris on the
                              Albert Ballin boat train. Putting pictures aboard a boat is easy if you know how.
                              Just be at the station a few minutes before the train pulls out and watch the crowds
                              of homeward-bound Americans. Pick out one who is not worried about his baggage and
                              you have a seasoned traveler who will willingly take your small package of pictures.
                              Tell him all he has to do is take it with him aboard ship and leave it in a prominent
                              place in his cabin. Then note his name and cabin number and cable that together with
                              the name of the ship to the New York office, and that’s that. The package is picked
                              up at Quarantine direct from his cabin, without the necessity of searching all over
                              the ship. A large red label on each of my packages made them easy for the messenger
                              to spot in the most cluttered cabin. Most travelers are glad to oblige, and few if
                              any packages have missed their destinations.

                           <date id="d18997e1991" when="--01-31">January 31</date> issue. There is plenty of life and fire in the Philadelphia Art News—especially noticeable
                           in your clean-cut editorial on the Coffee bill and Weldon Bailey’s realistic and intelligent
                           view of what ails American art patronage.

                           I evidently concur in wanting the greatest betterment for ALL American artists—not
                           one particular minority that happens to shout their demands from a paternal government.
                           After careful examination, the unfortunate Coffee bill impresses me as an unholy alliance
                           between Fascism and Communism. Personally, I feed at neither trough.

                           on art and artists, not their economic circumstances nor any other personal affiliations.
                           The artist, as a person, an individual, and a citizen, as in every other phase of
                           human endeavour, should enjoy the rights and privileges of his chosen profession.
                           Let us be done with sentimental rights, and false ideas of patronage and kindness.
                           In the name of humanity, feed, clothe, and house all who need it; that is only decent
                           and right. But don’t confuse that necessity and make it an issue of art, medicine

                           for in the latest revised form of the Coffee Bill. The only one not included is the
                           selection of regional administrators by the vote of all practising artists in the
                           region. Artists would have no constitutional right to select Government officials
                           by vote. The bill provides their selection from a panel of names submitted by representatives
                           of the artists employed under the Bureau in order to assure employees a voice in their
                           own administration, a practise long in use in industry. There seems no reason for
                           artists not under the jurisdiction of the Bureau to have desire or permission to select
                           its administrators.

                           W.P.A. Federal Projects had shown concretely the benefits of such a program and how
                           it should function could it be considered practical. It is logical that the first
                           bill should have been drafted with the existant projects as a pattern but both project
                           and non-project artists are well aware of the limitations of the W.P.A. and eager
                           to rid a permanent Bureau of them.

                           the country. This committee with central headquarters in the Murray Hill Hotel, New
                           York City has a nation-wide membership with Lawrence Tibbet as its chairman. Burgess
                           Meredith is chairman of its executive board and sub-committees for various arts are

                           Max Weber. Local committees are being organized in cities throughout the country and
                           all interested in a Bureau of Fine Arts are urged to join one of these groups.

                           can be found in this new encyclopedia. The two volumes cover the field of art terms,
                           art activities, and art personalities from Yen Li-Pen (“Chinese painter of the 7th
                           century”) to Eugene Speicher, from the caves of Altamira to the Escurial, by means
                           of clear, if necessarily brief definitions.

                        <p id="d18997e2051">Originally compiled by Louis Hourticq, Member of the Institute of France, the encyclopedia
                           has been translated under the supervision of Tancred Borencus of the University of
                           London. Numerous modernizations and revisions have been made by J. Leroy Davidson
                           and Philippa Gerry, assisted by a staff of experts in various fields.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d18997e2054">This edition of Hourticq’s work has been very finely gotten up. The type, though not
                           large, is preeminently readable. There are a multitude of illustrations, including
                           two full color plates, one hundred and twenty-five groups of half-tone reproductions,
                           and innumerable black and white drawings scattered through the text.

                        <p id="d18997e2057">The price, $30.00 for the two volumes, may be out of the reach of most individuals,
                           but surely there must be many groups or clubs which could afford to obtain this very
                           valuable publication. Indeed, it would almost seem indispensable to any “art library”.
                           The wealth of clear, concise information it contains, will more than repay the original
                           purchase price.
