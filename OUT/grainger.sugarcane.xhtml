                              engaged themselves with the natives, was another hindrance to physical investigation.
                              But whether the

                              It is also equally uncertain whether Sugar was first made in the Islands or on the
                              Continent,
                              and whether the

                              <name id="d195791e302">Portuguese</name> were the first planters in the new world:
                              it is indeed most likely that the latter erected the first sugar-works in 
                              <placeName id="d195791e305">Brazil</placeName>, as they are

                              soon suffered a manifest decay. However, their sugar made them ample amends,
                              in which trade they continued almost without a rival for upwards of a century. At
                              last

                              during one and twenty years they kept that conquest, those industrious republicans
                              learned the art making sugar. This probably inspired the

                              The red requires a better mould, and always emits a disagreeable smell before rain.

                              be done at a moderate expence, it would be rendered inaccessible. The

                              <name id="d195791e746">Spaniards</name>, who opposed them, began to plant tobacco
                              here A.D. 1623. Two years after, the 
                              <rs id="d195791e749" type="properAdjective">English</rs>-settlers received a considerable reinforcement from their
                              mother-country; and, the chiefs of both nations, being men of sound policy, entered
                              
                              into an agreement to divide the island between them: the 
                              <name id="d195791e752">French</name> retaining
                              both extremities, and the 
                              <name id="d195791e755">English</name> possessing themselves of the middle parts of the island.
                              Some time after both nations erected sugar-works, but there were more tobacco, indigo,
                              coffee, and cotton-plantations, than Sugar ones, as these require a much greater fund
                              to
                              carry them on, than those other. All the planters, however, lived easy in their circumstances;
                              for, though the 
                              <name id="d195791e759">Spaniards</name>, who could not bear to be spectators of their thriving
                              condition, did repossess themselves of the island, yet they were soon obliged to
                              retire, and the colony succeeded better than ever. One reason for this, was that it
                              had
                              been agreed between the two nations, that they should here remain neutral whatever
                              wars their mother-counties might wage against each other in Europe. This was
                              a wise regulation for an instant settlement; but, when

                              repent their impolitic breach of faith; for the expelled planters, being assisted
                              by their

                              countries ere they could be prevailed upon to taste it; and it must be confessed.
                              that the

                              other hot ingredients. The tree often grows fifteen or twenty feet high, and is
                              streight and handsome. The pods which seldom contain less than thirty nuts of
                              the size of a flatted olive, grow upon the stem and principal branches. The tree
                              loves a moist, rich, and shaded soil: Hence those who plant cacao-walks, sometimes

                              they are past the danger of being destroyed by dry weather, &amp;c. Some recommend
                              planting cassada, or bananas, in the intervals, when the cacao-trees are young,
                              to destroy weeds, from which the walk cannot be kept too free. It is generally
                              three years before they produce good pods; but in six years, they are in highest
                              perfection. The pods are commonly of the size and shape of a large cucumber.
                              There are three or four sorts of cacao, which differ from one another in the colour

                              fewer than 100 eggs. These she carefully covers with sand. But, notwithstanding
                              this precaution, the gallinazo (a large species of carrion crow) conceals itself among
                              the thick boughs of the nieghbouring trees, and thus often discovers the hoard of
                              the
                              alligator which she no sooner leaves, than the gallinazo souses down upon it, and
                              greedily scraping off the sand, regales on its contents. Nor is the male alligator
                              less
                              an enemy to the increase of his own horrid brood, than these useful birds; for, when
                              instinct prompts the female to let her young fry out by breaking the eggs. he never
                              
                              fails to accompany her and to devour as many of them as he can: So that the mother
                              scarece ever escapes into the river with more than five out of all her hundred. Thus
                              providence doubly prevents the otherwise immense propacation of that voracious animal,
                              on the banks of the river

                              informs us. But we happily are not obliged to believe, implicitly, whatever that elaborate
                              compiler has told us. When poisons immediately operate on the nervous
                              system, and their effects are to be expelled by the skin, this electuary is no contemptible
                              antidote. But how many poisons do we know at present, which produce their 
                              effects in a different manner? and, from the 
                              <sic id="d195791e2516">acounts</sic> of authors, we have reason to
                              be persuaded, that the antients were not much behind us in their variety of poisons.
                              If, therefore, the King of Pontus had really intended to have destroyed himself, he
                              
                              could have been at no loss for the means, notwithstanding the daily use of this antidote.

                              <ref id="d195791e2737">the bending coco's]</ref> The coco-nut tree is of the palm genus; there are
                              several species of them, which grow naturally in the Torrid Zone. The coco-nut tree
                              is, by no means, so useful as travellers have represented it. The wood is of little
                              or no service, being spungy, and the brown covering of the nuts is of too rough a
                              texture to serve as apparel. The shell of the nut receives a good polishl and having
                              a hantle to put to it, is commonly used to drink water out of. The milk or water 
                              of the nut, is cooling and pleasant; but, if drunk too freely, will frequently occasion
                              a pain in the stomach. A salutary oil may be extracted from the kernel; which, if
                              old, and eaten too plentifully, is apt to produce a shortness of breathing. A species
                              of arrack is made from this tree, in the 
                              <placeName id="d195791e2740">East-Indies</placeName>. The largest coco-nut trees grow
                              on the banks of the 
                              <geogName id="d195791e2743">river Oronoko</geogName>. They thrive best near the sea, and look beautiful
                              at a distance. They afford no great shide. Ripe nuts have been produced from
                              them in three years after planting. The nuts should be macerated in water, before
                              they are put in the ground.

                              soon grows agreeable. Some authors have also confounded the coco-nit palm, with
                              the coco, or chocolate tree. The

                              proves immediate death; for, by driving all the blood from the body immediately

                        <p id="d195791e3365">Soon after my arrival in the 
                           <placeName id="d195791e3367">West-Indies</placeName>, I conceived the de-
                           sign of writing a poem on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane.
                           My inducements to this arduous undertaking were, not only the 
                           importance and novelty of the subject, but more especially this consideration; 
                           that, as the face of the country was wholly different
                           from that of 
                           <placeName id="d195791e3370">Europe</placeName>, so whatever hand copied its appearances,
                           however rude, could not fail to enrich poetry with many new and
                           picturesque images.
                           
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d195791e3374">I cannot, indeed, say I have satisfied my own ideas in
                           this particular: yet I must be permitted to recommend the precepts
                           contained in this Poem. They are the children of Truth, not of 
                           Genius; the result of Experience, not the productions of Fancy.
                           Thus, though I may not be able to please, I shall stand some
                           chance of instructing the Reader; which, as it is the nobler end of
                           all poetry, so should it be the principal aim of every writer who
                           wishes to be thought a good man.

                           are suited to every climate where Cane will grow; yet,
                           the more minute rules are chiefly drawn from the practice of St.
                           Christopher. Some selection was necessary; and I could adopt no
                           
                           
                           
                           modes of planting, with such propriety, as those I had seen practised 
                           in that island, where it was been my good fortune chiefly to
                           reside since I came to the

                        <p id="d195791e3383">I have often been astonished, that so little has been published
                           on the cultivation of the Sugar-Cane, while the press has groaned
                           under folios on every other branch of rural

                           unjust to suppose planters were not solicitous for the improvement
                           of their art, and injurious to assert they were incapable of obliging
                           mankind with their improvements.
