                        <p id="d47302e206">The Coffee Bill, officially called the “Federal Arts Act”, is primarily a piece of
                           imperialistic bureaucracy. It is filled with political plums. Under its terms the
                           government assumes a paternalistic attitude towards the family of artists it creates.
                           This family becomes a dynasty of princes and princesses who inbreed in the manner
                           of the ancient Egyptians. Poverty is sufficient proof of royal blood, admitting one
                           forever into the corridors of the Federal Arts palace, “entitled to all the rights
                           and benefits and privileges of Federal employees.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e210">The Federal Arts Bill as it was introduced in the House of Representatives on 
                           <date id="d47302e212" when="1937-08-16">August 16, 1937</date>, is not democratic. It would create a new class in a society which pretends to the
                           exclusion of class distinction. This class would be supported by taxation of the community-at-large.
                           It would be ruled by political appointees. Its chief Commissioner would wield enormous
                           political power. He himself would be answerable, not to the requisites of Art—but
                           to the whims of the political administration of the government.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e216">Those who would be on the payroll of the Federal Arts Act would be beautifully protected.
                           They, as a class, would enjoy an economic security not granted to any other professional
                           group.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e219">These two factors, one the political bureaucracy controlling the organization, and
                           two, its lesser members enjoying a guaranteed security based primarily on economic
                           need, are antagonistic. The former points directly toward fascism; the latter toward
                           communism. Combined, they would operate a mass production of art, lacking the tonic
                           of aesthetic selectivity, and ignoring the abilities of all those artists who are
                           not on the government payroll.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e222">As it now stands, the Federal Arts Act is an anomaly. It is politically inconsistent.
                           It proposes to take over the whole fabric of the art projects under W.P.A., a relief
                           measure, and transform it by fiat into a bureau for the development of American culture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e225">The industry of art suffers from an inadequate and cumbersome distribution system
                           of its products—a system which is filled with abuses. Something must be done to enable
                           art to function as a vital cultural factor in the life of the nation, but whatever
                           is done, should be harmonious with the spirit of American democracy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e228">Government support for art may be a necessity. Artists need an economic security which
                           seems unattainable under present conditions. However, economic need, per se, is not
                           a criterion of aesthetic value or cultural worth. We understand that the Federal Arts
                           Act is now being revised. Let us hope that it will be redesigned to insure the employment
                           of capable administrators and artists of high promise and proven ability; that the
                           bureau will have the specific function of promoting a vital national culture and will
                           not be merely a colorless annex to the Relief Administration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e232">Despite all the weaknesses of the Federal Arts Acts, it is without doubt one of the
                           most courageous and hopeful bills ever introduced into the House of Representatives
                           Intelligent revision can make it the most effective cultural aid in the history of
                           the country. If the government is going to operate a bureau of the Fine Arts, it must
                           do so with full responsibility to its citizens. The steps necessary for the democratic,
                           and at the same time aesthetically sound functioning of the Bureau are very clear
                           and easy. They are:—

                              into districts necessary for the impartial operation of the Bureau, and to administer
                              the business of the central office.

                              are on W.P.A., should select the regional administrators by untrammeled nomination
                              and vote. This would insure true democratic cultural representation.

                           a higher standard of living—not for one professional group—but for the whole nation.

                              as the “Bureau”. The Bureau shall consist of a Commissioner and six members.

                              and he may be reappointed.

                              work on the Bureau at an hourly rate equal to the rate of compensation payable to
                              them if they were employed as artists on the works projects provided in this Act.
                              The tenure of members of the Bureau shall be two years. In selecting the members of
                              the Bureau, the Commissioner shall consult with organizations representing artists

                        <p id="d47302e551">We can remember, a number of years ago, when our annual visit to the Pennsylvania
                           Academy of the Fine Arts, for the Oil and Sculpture show was an eagerly anticipated
                           emotional experience. We never knew exactly what we’d find there, but we were fairly
                           certain that it would be unusual, exciting and inclined to provoke a great deal of
                           dissension and discussion.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e554">Many a painter would hold forth, to some, with glorious verve of line and color—to
                           others, with impudence; while many another canvas may sparkle with the makings of
                           a grand fight between critics and public alike.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e558">But now we seem to have settled down, if the One Hundred and Thirty-third Annual Exhibition,
                           now current there, is a criterion. Here we find an evenness of pigmental conception
                           and execution that verges upon the monotonous. There is not one canvas in the exhibit
                           that rears itself proudly above its fellows—and very few that sink to the level of
                           definitely bad painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e561">We are not of the opinion that this sort of exhibit is a truthful cross-section of
                           contemporary American painting—at any rate we want to feel that there should be some
                           highlights.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e564">Occupying the most prominent position in the show is “Marianna” by Eugene Speicher,
                           manifesting little more than sound but uncompelling painting. Doris Lee, on the other
                           hand, does “Strawberry Pickers” replete with phantasy and provocative color. Fullness
                           of form and decorative concentration reminiscent of Peter Breughel is to be found
                           in James B. Turnbull’s “The Refugees”, while the same spirit, but accomplished with
                           vastly different technique, emanates from Paul Cadmus’ “Guilding the Acrobat”, a small
                           canvas, but one of the most arresting in the show, and, for its quality, badly placed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e567">An interesting comparison of opposite visions is to be made between Daniel Garber
                           and James Calder, both of whom contribute canvases of “Willows”, which unfortunately
                           are not placed together. Garber runs the gamut of meticulous technique and has not
                           missed a variation of the subtle greens found in a tree mass; Calder sees breadth
                           and no great variety of greens, and paints with a sweeping, dramatic brush stroke.
                           The Calder is the more vital.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e570">Ruthless honesty resides in Max Weber’s “Broken Tree”. It is refreshing to see a canvas
                           of Weber minus his accustomed pudgy distortion. The Martino brothers, Antonio and
                           Giovanni, are coming up, and show street scenes that would do credit to Hopper.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e573">Isaac Soyer sees “School Girls” with a subtlety that the girls themselves probably
                           do not possess; “Dream House”, by Alexander Brook, is not only an ironic comment (being
                           a shack in process of remodeling) but one of the show’s finest bits of painting. Louis
                           Eilshemius is represented by a peculiarly bad canvas, George Grosz by a riot of color
                           (a street fight on a large scale—seemingly war), William Glackens by his vague but
                           gorgeously effective iridescences, and Walter Gardner by a landscape rich in green,
                           and active, for all its peace of spirit.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e577">Earl Horter’s “Black Water” is one of the freshest oils we have seen from this artist.
                           Incidentally, it is in effect, more like his water colors—the quaint buildings, carriages
                           and ship masts are quite jewellike. From Rockwell Kent comes one of his most stolid,
                           and least expressive, mountain studies, and S. Walter Norris, on the other hand, shows
                           one of his most agreeable compositions of squarish buildings in a squarish world.

                        <p id="d47302e580">William Paxton’s “Nausicad” we should like to sub-title “Nausea”. We have never been
                           able to unearth a sufficient excuse for Paxton’s technique of the tinted photograph,
                           but this canvas of pretty-pretty nudes is particularly offensive.

                        <p id="d47302e594">Kuniyoshi’s “Toward Village” and Hobson Pittman’s “Early Spring” are well placed side
                           by side—they compliment each other and show great feeling for flow of color tone.
                           A view of “Steeplechase Park” by Reginald Marsh indicates that the painter should
                           be quite wealthy if paid by the figure; in this composition another would burst through
                           the frame. Marsh has a genuine claim to fame, but why must he overload his canvases?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e597">In “Sheldon Street” Francis Speight shows the beauty of hills in the city and has
                           made the most of it in a simple tonal way. Walter Stuempfig’s “Skating Party” strengthens
                           his reputation as an original colorist and happy composer of pictures; Emlen Etting’s
                           “Stone City” creates an eerie mood with its arch, background of drab stone buildings
                           and a few lonely figures. “Flower Seller”, by Herbert Jennings, is an accomplishment
                           of tonal paintings—vivid flowers are contrasted sharply to the darkly clad and almost
                           silhouetted negro vender.

                        <p id="d47302e600">Something is happening to Biago Pinto. Where are the Soutinesque swirls? Pinto’s “Checker
                           Game” is quite devoid of them—instead we find thick outlines and enormous solidity
                           of mass and color. It’s an interesting development and we’re anxious to see what will
                           happen.

                        <p id="d47302e604">Julius Bloch, we are convinced, has found his metier—American youth—as witness “The
                           Hitch-Hiker”. As the antithesis of this realism we may cite Stuart Davis, who, although
                           “skyed”, has contributed the most joyously patterned color in the exhibition: “Composition—Terminal”.

                        <p id="d47302e607">Walter Baum, in “Carversville”, continues to view small towns with looseness of handling,
                           much plastic strength and richness of color. Fred Wagner’s canvas is of ambitious
                           size and captures beautifully the spirit and motion of a large city’s busy harbor.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e610">Henry Varnum Poor’s study of Waldo Peirce is the best portrait here. As a character
                           study it is forceful and uncompromising, and as color tremendously striking: the sitter’s
                           blue sweater sings against a crimson background.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e613">Among the more conventional portraits, two are outstanding. Jean MacLane’s young girl
                           is most agreeable, and we should like to see what this painter might do with landscape.
                           The Sargeant-school type of technique found usually in the paintings of Wayman Adams
                           we do not care for, but his present portrait, that of Morris Gest, is one of the most
                           superb characterizations we have ever seen. Gest seems at any moment, ready to burst
                           into an orgy of elaborate theatrical production.

                        <p id="d47302e616">George Biddle’s “Family Portrait” is large and (for its size) very delicately handled.
                           Other arresting canvases (not portraits) are contributed by Virginia Armitage McCall,
                           Elliott Orr, Paul Mommer, Robert Phillips, Lucius Crowell and Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones.

                        <p id="d47302e619">The sculpture section is far from encouraging. There are the usual conventional nudes,
                           conventional heads and conventional animals—dull and without imagination, except for
                           a possible half-dozen works.

                        <p id="d47302e623">Walker Hancock’s “Fallen Boxer” has caught the beauty of an athlete even in defeat;
                           James Savage’s “Bell Ringer” manifests the simple strength of motion; Emma Lu Davis’
                           crouching football player, “Centre”, is full of imagination (executed in color); “Three
                           Bears” by Edmund Amateis and “Mother and Child” by Samuel Cashwan reveal great ingenuity
                           of geometric form; and Nathaniel Choate, with his “Morrocan Goat” has grasped the
                           amusing character of the animal.

                        <p id="d47302e629">It is a highly stimulating show, quite varied, and indicates that emphasis is being
                           placed upon our more youthful and progressive artists, which is largely as it should
                           be.

                        <p id="d47302e632">The future of American art lies in the hands of the young artists of today, and those
                           working under this project are making the most of their opportunities.

                        <p id="d47302e635">The oil section is particularly varied and vital. William Ferguson, well represented,
                           is a painter of vivid imagination, whether he turns to phantasy or a simple scene.
                           Thomas Flavell is improving tremendously in strength of conception and technique.
                           Leon Kelly’s oils, varying greatly in size, are executed with his accustomed vigor,
                           and Grace Gemberling, in “Harvesting”, has realized the joy of golden browns and greens.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e638">Michael Leone sees “Philadelphia from the Museum” with Dufy-like pattern, but with
                           a harder line. We like Salvatore Pinto’s “Ballet Girl” with her unusually pink body—the
                           whole a fine decorative color scheme. Another visionally expressed affection for the
                           Museum comes from Frank Stamato. Matthew Sharpe’s contributions are not his best.
                           Stewart Wheeler shows an increasing inclination for hard, black outlines, rather suggestive
                           of Van Gogh—particularly his oil “Zinnias and Squash”. Julius Bloch is represented
                           by three oils varied in style: a floral study, simple and fresh, an expressionistic
                           “Camp Meeting Evangelist” and a strong portrait: “The Marble Champ”.

                        <p id="d47302e642">Among the drawings, Daniel Rasmusson is most widely represented. He draws with much
                           verve, and his delineations of the nude are most sympathetic. Included is a large
                           mural study—“Te Deum”—in pastel. Striking drawings are likewise contributed by Leon
                           Kelly, Julius Bloch, William Ferguson, Hubert Mesibov and Salvatore Pinto.

                        <p id="d47302e645">Contributors of water colors include Glenn Pearce, whose “The Old Maid” is one of
                           the best water colors, revealing the exterior of old-fashioned houses, the sun shining
                           quietly, and convincingly, upon them; Lloyd Ney who concentrates upon the character
                           of his fellow man; Thomas Flavell, whose water colors range from bananas to the circus;
                           and Stewart Wheeler, who eyes a swimming hole.

                        <p id="d47302e648">Yoshimatsu Onaga’s colossal “Figure”, in stone, dominates the sculpture section. Michael
                           Gallagher, Richard Hood and Hubert Mesibov are the most generously represented in
                           the prints. Gallagher in a wood block, portrays Onaga engaged upon his large statue.

                           most effectively utilized in a number of prints by Gallagher, Mesibov and Dox Thrash.
                           Other print media are lithography, etching, aquatint, drypoint, mezzotint and linoleum

                           an Honorable Mention for “Macbeth—Act V”, apparently a doleful small-town funeral;
                           and an additional prize of $10.00 was granted Leonard Pytlak, of P. W. A., for his
                           color lithograph “Underground”, a subway station seen with definite power.

                           “Circus on the Move”—strong, colorful, not at all self-conscious; Gyula Zilzer: “The
                           Postman”—large, bold and amusing print; Jack Markow: “Seven Course Dinner”—painfully
                           frank comment on an obese gourmet; Kenneth M. Adams: “Miner”—fine, strong delineation;
                           Hubert Davis: “The Ocean View” and “Window on the Valley”:—unusual for Davis, large,
                           light and free; Meyer Wolfe: “I Hid My Face Before the Lord”—deeply rhythmic expression
                           of negroes singing.

                           a departure for Gag (death and destruction in China); Earl Miller: “Hot Country” and
                           “Design with Nudes”—the first an effective combination of brush and crayon, the second
                           delicately scratched white lines upon black ground, and pictorially powerful; Vera

                        <p id="d47302e680">As an artist, Mackie appears the possess a dual personality: of the portraitist and
                           the decorative painter. So at variance in spirit are the portraits with the decorative
                           paintings that they may well have been produced by different artists.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e683">The portraits, to be sure, embrace a great deal of the decorative themselves, but
                           of a very unlike nature. They are lively, and Mackie has successfully incorporated
                           acute character analysis and a genuine flair for the proper presentation of his sitter.

                        <p id="d47302e700">The decorative paintings, none of which are very large, for most part express the
                           happy vision of a man who loves the world he lives in and sees nothing unpleasant
                           in it. Such canvases as “On Lake Como”, “Antibes”, “Provencal Landscape” and “Near
                           Biot”, have immense variety of form, and color well proportioned in relation to their
                           complimentary grays.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e703">“Biot-Var” makes the most of the decorative roofs of quaint buildings clustered upon
                           hills. “Wild Flowers” is a sprightly canvas and offers the agreeable contrast of thick
                           impasto in the blooms and thin glazes of pigment in the vase and background. The only
                           nude in the exhibition is handled with simplicity and here no effort has been made
                           in the direction of color elaboration.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e707">The Artist’s Union is staging an exhibit of oils, water colors, and photographs at
                           the Union’s Club House.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e710">It is inclined to be a rather uneven show, although boasting several extremely fine
                           works.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e713">Ralston Crawford, for instance, has contributed one of his best canvases: “Steel Mill
                           #2”. Composed of flat patterns of gray-brown, pale blue and black, it is an accomplishment
                           of thoughtful, logical pattern. This and Charles E. Cockey’s “Landscape” are the best
                           in the exhibit. Following closely are Nat Koffman’s freely handled “Girl” and Josef
                           Presser’s “Cunegonde”, a nude of extraordinary vigor.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e716">Jof Tonnar’s “Suppertime” is an iridescent and well rounded human comment, and Samuel
                           Freed’s “Miners” is characterized by a most unpleasant distribution of two figures
                           which, in themselves, are well painted. Miriam P. Rosenbach shows an admirable landscape,
                           executed with free painter’s vision and composed of sensuous, expressive masses of
                           soft, thin pigment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e719">Isadore Possoffis “Sweatshop” has much in point of active design reinforced by vivid
                           color, and Nicholas Marsicano’s “Spain” is an inchoate bit of pigmental lust. Crude
                           and raw is Lisa O. Langley’s “Hillside in Glen Riddle”—we’ve seen much better from
                           this painter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e722">Among other exhibitors are Fritz Noyes, Robert Volz and A. L. Chanin.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e726">The most patent quality in the oils of Ben Wolf, now on exhibition at the Warwick
                           Galleries, is simplicity and concentration of color tone. From these canvases we assume
                           the painter’s philosophy to be one that admits of but a minimum of tonal variation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e729">It is, all things considered, a vision more at ease with landscape than figure, although
                           two “studies”, small nudes, are accomplished with a great deal of expressive freedom.
                           The better of the larger nudes is “Flesh Against Lemon Yellow”—the flesh, nevertheless,
                           is rather too putty-like.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e732">“Dyer Street, Provincetown”, is a solid composition of buildings, the color tastefully
                           grayed, except for the impact of its green tree. Rugged indeed is “When the Tide is
                           Out”, the harbor, with its pier, realized with vigor. In the beach the painter has
                           achieved convincingly the effect of its unevenly distributed sand.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e735">“Cold Day” and “Over the Hill” reveal the painter’s happiest subject-matter. Both
                           have quiet color—all elements of the pictures under control, and well balanced.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e738">Wolf’s best canvases are those in which blue is realized as the keynote. “The Witching
                           Hour”, “Thick Fog”, “Dark Against Light”, “The Solemnity” and “Reflections” embrace
                           the beauty of blue as Wolf sees it. The last named is the finest of these, wherein
                           the painter has enhanced the poetry of blue by an occasional, and well placed, spot
                           of orange.
                        </p>

                        </head>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e748">“I have just returned from my winter trips to the important exhibitions in the East.
                           It was a pleasant surprise to find three fresh copies of your dandy little paper waiting
                           for me. You have, it seems to me, undertaken a really worthwhile task in your publication
                           of a Philadelphia Art Digest. Philadelphia needs it. I wish your paper every possible
                           success.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e751">I have a suggestion to make. With the low price of your paper and with sufficient
                           general information together with feature articles concerning the Arts, it will not
                           be long before there is a wide distribution, which in turn surely will have a tremendous
                           effect (I hope!) on the public’s interest in works of art. Perhaps an appreciation
                           of what Art really is will grow from your noble endeavor. Perhaps you will help transform
                           public taste and encourage new standards. Perhaps you will sow the seeds for the feeling
                           of quality which is so necessary . . . for no art can endure if it cannot stand on
                           its own quality, regardless of all the ballyhooing and publicising and showmanship
                           employed to make it popular.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e754">Tell the truth and the public will eat it up!</p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e757">Among the shows I had chance to see, were of course the Dutch pictures at Knoedler’s.
                           I happened in last Sunday when they were being hung. The confusion didn’t spoil it
                           for me because there are so many wonderful works as only the seventeenth century Dutchmen
                           could produce them. I was in a glorious state of excitement. I was not only excited
                           by the busy men with ladders and hooks and the activity of my friend that helped decide
                           where the de Hoochs and the Cuyps and the Terburgs should hang, I also found time
                           to ooh and aah at the perfect examples of correct drawing and naturalistic representation
                           of the Ruysdaels. I was so happy with the exhibition ‘Holland Indoors and Out’ that
                           when I returned to my friend’s studio I felt like an academic pedagogue that had just
                           wakened from a dream in which everything conformed with my canons of good color and
                           proportion and notions of what the Golden Age of Dutch Art really is. The Dutch in
                           their fight for liberation from the Spanish situation of the day built up their national
                           character and developed the resources of their own country. Yet under conditions quite
                           dreary the genius of the seventeenth century masters discovered its own racial expression
                           in painting.

                        <p id="d47302e761">New York has had a great many other fine shows this season as have Washington, Richmond,
                           Pittsburgh and other cities. I was quite thrilled with the needlework shown at the
                           small Arden Gallery in New York. At Charlottesville in Virginia I ran across a small
                           Gallery managed by a Mrs. Speed who has a good deal of taste and is willing to arrange
                           for loans of pictures.”

                           negative one which is so general—is very necessary for the healthy growth of art.
                           This constructive appreciation must be evidenced by discriminating patronage. Every
                           great period of art in history has existed because of active selective financial support
                           of artists.

                           promote extensive private ownership”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1034">This new organization is a healthy symptom of the growth of American aesthetic consciousness
                           and confidence. Through such movements as this the day may come when the intelligent
                           American will feel free to think for himself and be guided by his individual taste
                           in the selection of art for his home. Art will then, but not until then, contribute
                           fully to the richness of living in this nation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1037">Those who begin now to share in the discriminating patronage of contemporary American
                           Art will profit thereby. They will help to find great art in America, and become the
                           owners of it. They will receive a substantial aesthetic return, and it is doubtful
                           if they could make a sounder financial investment.

                        <p id="d47302e1043">An organized effort is being made to bring into a more adequate ratio the problem
                           of supply and demand in contemporary American art. The Collectors of American Art,
                           Inc., a non-profit organization to promote extensive private ownership of contemporary
                           American art, has just been formed by a group of New York art lovers. The new organization
                           is basically a revival of the idea of the old American Art Union, which, started 99
                           years ago, grew in one decade to a membership of 18,960 and in 1849 distributed among
                           its members art works worth $96,300. Headquarters have been established at 38 West
                           57th Street, New York, where active preparations are now in progress for the first
                           monthly exhibition to open 
                           <date id="d47302e1045" when="--02-02">February 2</date>.

                        <p id="d47302e1049">As in the days of the old Art Union, funds obtained from lay membership will be utilized
                           to purchase paintings and prints from this and subsequent exhibitions for allocation
                           among members at the annual meeting of the Association in 
                           <date id="d47302e1051" when="1938-05">May, 1938</date>. Any American artist may submit pictures for these exhibitions, the exhibits for
                           which will be selected by the organization’s Exhibition Committee. Application for
                           invitation to submit work should be made to Collectors of American Art, Inc., at 38
                           West 57th Street, New York City. In line with the Association’s policy “to promote
                           extensive private ownership”, the public will be welcome at these exhibitions.

                           B. Tschudy, Mrs. M. B. Sinclaire, George H. Fitch, Dr. Alice I. Bryan, G. M. Dallas
                           Peltz III and Kenneth Howell, were later joined by Robert W. Macbeth, Peyton Boswell,
                           Jr., Frank D. Fackenthal, Robert M. McDonald, Lee Ault, J. Hamilton Coulter, Miss
                           Olive M. Lyford, Miss Grace Mayer and Mrs. Martin Frisch. This is the nucleus of an
                           organization that presents a call to the American can people to sustain and encourage
                           the native artist through the purchase of his work.

                        <p id="d47302e1059">Success of the organization’s aims will, naturally, depend upon the scope and loyalty
                           of its lay membership. Every subscriber of $5 is a member for the year, and entitled
                           to all the benefits of participation. According to the number of members, works of
                           art will be purchased from the monthly exhibitions for distribution among the members
                           in May. Each member will receive a painting or a print equivalent in monetary value
                           at least to the cost of membership—it may be an etching well worth $5, or it may be
                           a painting for which the Purchasing Committee has paid the maximum price of $250.

                        <p id="d47302e1083">The most uncomfortable thing we can think of concerning the artist is his name. Not
                           name in the sense of “reputation”, but as we use other nouns: butcher, baker and candlestick-maker.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1086">Today the word “artist” seems to possess a significance which it disdained even during
                           the magnificence of the Renaissance. Michaelangelo was, to himself, a tradesman, while
                           the brothers Van Eyck were little more than house-painters to their public. The fact
                           that they were artists was assumed, and upon that blessed name hung no fabulous jewels
                           of temperament: they were simply, and fruitfully, workers—worked as many another,
                           but perchance better.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1089">The appellation “artist” lacks today that erstwhile dignity, and implies in most minds
                           more of the cavorting of a prima-donna than the labor of a creator. And it is by no
                           means advantageous to the artist.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1093">In fact, herein resides one of the major tragedies of America, which, for all its
                           culture in certain respects, continues to insist upon things being definite. Her doctors
                           have their degrees and have duly served their internship. They are definitely doctors.
                           The lawyers have been admitted formally and officially to the bar after a logical
                           amount of preparation. They are definitely lawyers. The accountant is certified and
                           the plumber registered.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1096">But what, definitely, is the artist? To America, nothing. He may have studied at the
                           Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, or the Art Student’s League, or gone abroad
                           to Andre L’Hote. Likewise, he may have gone no where at all, like John Kane, or many
                           others. That is what confuses his own America. She accepts him because he has thrilled
                           her occasionally, and because she “couldn’t draw a straight line with a ruler”. But
                           she must be made to respect her artists as professional men.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1099">In this she has failed largely because many have taken undue advantage of the fact
                           that an artist may reach Parnassus without either diploma or degree. By the same token
                           an impostor can organize an exhibition of his work and consequently call himself “artist”.
                           In such a case, there is small wonder that America is a bit dubious concerning her
                           artists, when the bad is touted equally with the good.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1102">Try as we may, there seems but one solution to this evil: time.</p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1105">The artistic parasite shall gradually be weeded out by the inevitable scythe, but
                           not before he has accomplished a bit of emotional swindling. Meanwhile, it is to be
                           hoped that the process of absorbing pictures shall add considerably to intelligent
                           buying by the public, and that a purchase shall mean, not merely an investment or
                           the slavish devotion to the advise of a friend, but the acquisition of a work of art
                           genuinely loved by its purchaser, where neither pity nor charity for the artist exist—only
                           the satisfaction of buying what one desires from a respected source.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1108">This is our legacy from past civilizations, and it will one day arrive with interest.
                           It needs, however, every iota of possible cooperation from our artists; as they desire
                           respect, they must, in turn, respect. When the best of art removes from the studio
                           into the open air, on a pedestal not too high for the people to see, there may come
                           an emotional reenactment of that greatest of all spiritual weddings: Cimabue and the
                           people of Florence.

                        <p id="d47302e1143">“Some of my students can draw better than I,” said Jerry Doyle, “professor” of the
                           world’s only University chair of cartooning. “But drawing is only ten per cent of
                           cartooning. The other ninety percent? Why, the idea behind the drawing.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1146">Jerry, sun-tanned from his recent West Indies cruise, mustache waxed, eyes sparkling,
                           sat in his class room on the tenth floor of Temple’s Cromwell Hall. In the class seventeen
                           year old hopefuls sit next to high school teachers. Some aspire to the same type career
                           as Mr. Doyle, who does political cartoons for the Philadelphia Record, the New York
                           Evening Post and the Courier-Post newspapers of Camden. Others dream of a Walt Disney
                           career.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1149">“If they have ideas, it is easy enough to teach the techniques,” believes Doyle, “and
                           if they can be taught to incorporate those ideas in their drawing, they will make
                           good.” If four of the class become successful cartoonists, Mr. Doyle will consider
                           the class a success, and he is confident that more than that number will make the
                           grade.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1153">Twenty per cent of the class are former art students, having studied at the Academy
                           or the School of Design. It is this group that sketches so well. However, the difficulty
                           of the former art student is in learning to draw from imagination rather than from
                           models.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1156">Most of the instruction is individual, and informality is the keynote. “Professor”
                           Doyle is affectionately known to the class as Jerry. On his desk the other evening
                           were candy canes wrapped in a big bow; the evening before, an apple.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1159">Jerry Doyle never took an art course. He boasts that Homer’s “Iliad” was his only
                           art teacher. It seems that Jerry was so bored during Greek classes at Philadelphia’s
                           St. Joseph’s College that for diversion during those classes, he drew. There were
                           so many and such lengthy classes that he became quite a proficient and imaginative
                           artist. Jerry’s first major cartoon was drawn during an important Greek examination.
                           He glanced at the questions and proceeded to sketch in the examination book his impression
                           of Attic Greek. The drawings, but for a Jesuit teacher with a sense of humor, would
                           have meant expulsion. The cartoon? Jerry doesn’t recall exactly, but he has a vague
                           memory of an over-ancient cheese depicting an over-ancient language.

                        <p id="d47302e1174">An illustrator who had achieved great success in his field had maintained a growing
                           interest in the fine arts during the years.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1177">At last came a time of awakening, when he interrupted his commercial career to make
                           purely aesthetic expressions of the concepts which had been developing in his mind.
                           After a period of trial and error he painted a group of remarkable canvases which
                           synthesized his great experience with life and his keen emotional responses to Nature
                           and Man.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1180">These canvases were unlike anything he had previously painted, except that in them
                           he employed the great facility of craftsmanship he had acquired in commercial practice.
                           In color, form and content they had assumed a new personality and individuality which
                           was astonishing and stimulating to those who visited his studio. Many asked him when
                           he was going to exhibit his work. He replied that he was biding his time until he
                           himself had thoroughly digested his new point of view.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1183">In due course, the director of one of America’s greatest art museums visited the studio
                           of the illustrator. The director was on tour, inviting pictures for a forthcoming
                           exhibition. He immediately invited two of the illustrator’s new paintings.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1187">Shortly before the date set for the exhibition, the museum director found that he
                           had exceeded his quota of invited pictures. Therefore he wrote an apologetic note
                           to the illustrator, asking him to allow one of the two invited pictures to go before
                           the jury. The illustrator consented.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1190">The jury met. The illustrator’s striking canvas came before it. There was a concerted
                           gasp of approval. Someone asked, “Who painted that?”—and started forward to find the
                           painter’s signature.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1193">“Gentlemen,” urged the director, “won’t you vote on this picture according to its
                           merits, before you learn who did it?”
                        </p>

                        <p id="d47302e1201">“Why not?” agreed a juryman. “It’s a swell thing.” Acceptance was unanimous. Then
                           the jury chorused, “Who painted it?” They examined the signature. “Well I’ll be——!”
                           exclaimed one. “He’s nothing but a—illustrator!”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1204">“I might have known!” grumbled another. “Look at that bird!” He pointed to a detail
                           with a scornful snort. “It’s an illustrator’s bird—”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1208">“And the way he’s done this bit,” complained a third. “Only an illustrator would have
                           done it that way.”
                        </p>

                           art and flowers. The window of one has been transformed into a section of art gallery
                           wall. In front of a black curtain are lovely framed flower compositions and Japanesque
                           still lifes, done in living flowers, frequently changed and varied. The other window
                           uses a similar idea in the background, framed bowls of roses against silver, but the
                           central figure is a huge palette, the color being supplied by potted cyclamens ranging
                           from white through pinks to deep red.

                           . . . and vice-versa. Technically speaking. Jumping our shutter up to, say, a thousandth
                           of a second will certainly stop speed. That is the trouble. It will stop it dead,
                           reducing movement to inertia. The result is static. Buck tradition. Go into reverse
                           and slow down the shutter. Let the velocity of the approaching object spread over
                           the film, trapping and imprisoning the sensation of speed, juggernaut power, and rapid
                           rhythms.

                        <p id="d47302e1290">The accompanying photograph of the Broadway Limited was managed in such a manner.
                           Lying prone on the ground as close as was safely possible to the tracks, the shot
                           was made as the engine roared over head with the focal point about one third of the
                           distance photographed. Coupling this with the diminished shutter action necessary
                           enabled the capturing of speed sequences glimpsed in the foreground, meanwhile maintaining
                           adequate detail in the distance. The diaphragm was cut to fill.

                           exhibition now being held in the Parkway branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia.
                           Illuminated books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance are on view in the entrance hall
                           of the Library for a period of six or seven weeks

                        <p id="d47302e1313">Manuscript illustration, in general, follows the characteristics of the painting of
                           the period, if anything retaining certain archaisms or conventionalities a little
                           longer. A leaf from an Italian Antiphonarium of the late thirteenth century, probably
                           executed in Florence, shows an idyllic, carefully done landscape with much the same
                           qualities of space, quiet and symmetry as those in contemporary Florentine painting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1316">Again, in exhibit No. 99, a Flemish Book of Hours of the Early fifteenth century,
                           the Last Judgment shows many similarities with early Flemish easel and wall painting.
                           The marvelous reds and blues of the Van Eycks are echoed in the colors of the manuscript;
                           the intense, yet whimsical, realism that inspired Geertgen reappears in the partly
                           buried souls whom a diminutive and greatly winged St. Michael assists to the Throne
                           of Heaven; the gaping Mouth of Hell indicates the fascination with the grotesque which
                           the elder Breughel displayed.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1320">One of the dominant traits of English art has always been the feeling for graceful
                           line, and the manuscripts reassert this feeling. In an English Bible of the early
                           thirteenth century, No. 29, the dominant decorative note comes in the marginal patterns
                           of fine, suave curves.

                           Vergil, a Greek Psalter of the thirteenth century, and the Augustinus Aurelius of
                           the late twelfth century French School.

                        <p id="d47302e1444">Last summer we heard curious rumors concerning Nantucket. One rumor whispered that
                           it was about to secede from these United States. Another that Windsor and his Duchess
                           were to be urged to establish a Duchy on this island in the sea. And thus Romance
                           reared its lovely head over the rocks and dunes of this mellow, sun-rich land.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1447">On this island so touched with royal romance, two Philadelphia artists built a home.
                           Being two buildings, they called it the “Greater and Lesser Light.” From an old New
                           England barn and little carpenter shop Gertrude and Hanna Monaghan created a poetic
                           fancy. They created Romance of their own in wood and iron and stone.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1451">In this small home is a poetry warm and rich, a poetry as of some calm soul set dreaming;
                           dreaming a tiny castle in the sand. Within its walls it seems to soar afar into distant
                           lands and ages. It relates to its place as a dreamer to his soil and there is the
                           same rich joy in it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1454">As you enter in you are enveloped by a sense of feudal richness—a flavor of old Phillip
                           of Spain or the Medici or of Richard of England.

                        <p id="d47302e1457">The windows that see you come and the studded door that lets you in are of rich chinese
                           red. The large tiled floor is in deep blacks and grays. The pillars by the yawning
                           fireplace and a door near by are of antique gold Italian polychrome. The thick hand-hewn
                           beams are oiled to a deep, rich tone. Two antique gold pillars flank the tall doorway
                           leading to a bright, well-appointed breakfast room.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1460">Heavy wooden stairs descend to a sunken garden on the lower level and on the site
                           of the old pig pen is a small brick Patio. A pair of large wrought iron grilles enrich
                           the Patio with a frozen black lace.

                        <p id="d47302e1463">The old carpenter shop in the garden is now a rose-covered Guest House, the “Lesser
                           Light,” and on its top is a wrought iron weather vane, drawn from a favorite grey-hound.

                        <p id="d47302e1466">With fine sense of selection the Misses Monaghan have gathered here and there, from
                           auction rooms and junk yards. With these bits they have dreamed on paper and with
                           tiny models. They have dreamed the romance of rich ages and have achieved a harmony
                           that only comes through deep appreciation.

                           There is not a part of this “Greater and Lesser Light” that was not conceived with
                           loving consideration. It is as much a part of these two artists as their own breath
                           and blood. It is the outward expression of the inner soul.

                           and several examples from the recent Daumier exhibition are included. Two Degas, the

                        <p id="d47302e1537">This statement is taken from the circular announcing the One Hundred and Thirty-Third
                           Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. At first reading,
                           it sounds pre-eminently fair. Any artist is urged to submit his work, and each work
                           so submitted is assured of being fairly judged. But is this exactly the case?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1540">For last year’s Annual, between seventeen and eighteen hundred paintings were submitted
                           to the painting Jury. There were 258 canvases in the show. BUT 160 of these 258 had
                           been invited. In other words only a mere fraction, 98 to be exact, of the 1700 or
                           1800 were actually accepted by the Jury. Has the Jury been reduced to a group of artistic
                           yes-men? The figures for this year’s show have not been made public, but we can infer
                           from the very secrecy which surrounds them that they are substantially the same.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1544">Is this either a fair or sensible arrangement? The expense of transporting, framing,
                           insuring the pictures is not only enormous, but to the great majority of the 1700
                           or 1800 artists worthless. But an even more important situation derives from this
                           practice. Will not many worthwhile artists be deterred from submitting work because
                           of the apparent hopelessness of being one in eighteen?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1547">In view of these facts, should there not be some changes in the organization of the
                           Annual Exhibition? Two alternatives seem to present themselves. The show should be
                           entirely invited, as is the American painting show at the Whitney Museum, and thus
                           cease to flutter so many false hopes. OR the number of invited pictures should be
                           enormously reduced so that the Academy Annual may substantiate the belief that it
                           is an attempt to present the best of American painting, and not merely the work to
                           which established names are affixed.

                           painting, is now holding his first New York one-man show in five years. Twenty-eight
                           of Mr. Garber’s paintings are on view at the Tricker Galleries, 19 West 57th St.,
                           New York, until 
                           <date id="d47302e1566" when="--02-10">February 10</date>. There is also a group of thirty-three etchings and drawings, the drawings being
                           shown for the first time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e1570">The titles of Mr. Garber’s pictures recall the Pennsylvania landscape he paints so
                           frequently—“Birmingham Meeting”, “Lambertville”, “Tohickon”, “Springtime: Tohickon”.
                           The portrait of “Lathrop”, owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, is
                           included among the oils, while in the group of etchings and drawings is Garber’s “Self-Portrait”.

                        <p id="d47302e1579">The Atelier du Mode, a display shop at 1728 Ludlow St., has started a school of display
                           carrying out the idea, long in practice in New York, that the student should learn
                           display by carrying out practical problems of display merchandising. The school which
                           will be held in the actual shop, will work out ideas that are salable. In this way
                           students will be confronted with the problems that arise in the display man’s world
                           and learn by actuality rather than theory.

                           <p id="d47302e1887">The history of art has been directly influenced throughout the various schools of
                              painting by the materials available to the artist. During each period, we find the
                              artist keenly feeling the limitation of his materials and, in striving to give expression
                              to his artistic creations, seeking and developing new media. Even today, with the
                              more or less rapid advance of chemistry and physics as sciences during the last hundred
                              years, it has not been possible to develop an ideal medium serving the emotional demands
                              of the painter. Today we are indebted to the industrial paint chemist for a selection
                              of brilliant, permanent and durable color pigments, far exceeding in numbers the palette
                              of the painter at any other time. In fact, it is just this, which causes the artist
                              to have technical difficulties. If he is not somewhat acquainted with the properties
                              of the pigments he uses, he runs into trouble. Pigments, chemically unalterable, but
                              improperly used cause loss of color, cracking, lower tones; luminosity, tonal values
                              and glazes are disturbed or entirely lost. Frequently we find the artist condemning
                              the materials he used; but only seldom, today, is this the true cause. Lack of even
                              elemental knowledge of the craftsmanship and technique of painting is causing more
                              damage in modern pictures than use of faulty materials. Modern pigments, oils and
                              varnishes, if used properly, will yield works of art equal in every respect, in color,
                              brilliancy and permanency, to those of any other earlier period. With the very extended
                              selection of materials at the artist’s command today he may paint in any of the methods
                              of the early schools. If the Florentine, Venetian, Flemish, and Early Dutch Masters
                              had had available the rich, strong, and bright colors recently introduced, undoubtedly
                              their art would have been appreciably influenced.

                           <p id="d47302e1898">As we advance through the history of painting, from the very earliest evidences of
                              art—namely the wall paintings of paleolithic man in Altamira, Spain through the early
                              Egyptian, Assyrian, Phoenician, Mycenean and later Grecian painting—we recognize not
                              only an exceedingly limited palette of colors, but also a very elementary or primitive
                              craftsmanship. At first we find glue size, later eggs and wax, used as a painting
                              medium. Later, the Byzantines used oil and bitumen as varnish over glue, egg and wax
                              paintings. It was this practice which caused the darkening and destruction of so many
                              of these paintings.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47302e1901">Throughout the four main periods of art, we find the artist’s implements, painting
                              grounds, pigments and mediums, evolving from such primitive types to such sound techniques
                              as the tempera and true Buon Fresco established by the Florentines and to the mixed
                              oil-emulsion employed by the Flemish. The influence of this latter technique is evident
                              even in modern painting. The study of the chemistry, physics of light and color of
                              these early methods shows what remarkable craftsmen these painters were, particularly
                              if one considers that chemistry and physics had not as yet been highly developed.
                              And yet, we often hear the contemporary painter excusing his own technical deficiencies
                              by stating that the Old Masters had better materials with which to paint. The Old
                              Masters did not have the largely augmented selection of durable products which are
                              at the disposal of the modern painter. Neither did he have chemistry and physics to
                              help him solve his studio problems. It was, perhaps, his salvation that he had only
                              such a restricted palette; his factor of safety was greater.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d47302e1905">Any modern deficiencies of technique should be rather laid to lack of training. The
                              Medieval or Renaissance artist had first to serve an apprenticeship in the painter’s
                              guild. He underwent several years of rigid training, having assigned to him the duties
                              of preparing and refining the pigments, oils, mediums, and varnishes. The apprentice
                              was then gradually entrusted with more advanced work, becoming a Master only after
                              years of intensive work. It was during the last half of the nineteenth century that
                              we find the artist beginning to run into technical difficulties. The preparation of
                              his materials had become by then a separate industry. Industrial chemistry began to
                              develop and introduce a wide range of very brilliant, tempting colors with fanciful
                              names that sometimes hid the true identity of dangerous, fugitive colors. The artist
                              rather welcomed the severance of this, to him, uninspirational phase of his traditions,
                              but at the cost, unfortunately, of placing the durability of his efforts at the mercy
                              of frequently untried, new and recently developed products. No longer being intimately
                              acquainted with his materials, be became an emotional painter. We have glaring examples
                              of late nineteenth century paintings changed and degenerated. Men like Sargent, Whistler,
                              Eakins, who are representative of their period, have left some paintings the souls
                              of which departed not long after those of their creators. Laboratory research has
                              definitely shown that only in a few isolated instances are the changes so rife in
                              recent painting—darkening, cracking, yellowing, peeling, blistering and loss of glazes—caused
                              by faulty materials. They are directly traceable to faulty craftsmanship and lack
                              of technical knowledge. There is absolutely no reason why pictures today cannot be
                              painted equalling or surpassing in brilliancy, permanency, and durability those of
                              any other period.

                           comes with a 22x28 inch composition top suitable for use as a palette. This table
                           has three drawers divided into neat compartments to hold the odds and ends with which

                           airplane aluminum which will make perfect rectangles easy. The T-square costs $3.60
                           for 24 inches and 50c for each additional 6 inches. Its adjustable head can be removed

                           and private schools who should not be there, and two reasons present themselves: 1—inadequate
                           preparation and 2—lack of ability to perform creatively in their own right.

                        <p id="d47302e1980">I grant you that it is impossible to teach in the public schools without some sort
                           of academic degree or state certificate. Those diplomas and certificates, however,
                           cover a multitude of sins of omission as any holder of one would tell you if he spoke
                           truthfully. Somehow requirements must be raised and courses offered changed so that
                           people graduating from such institutions will go forth into the teaching field better
                           equipped to cope with the complex situation that presents itself today to the sincere
                           art teachers.

                           hearts of his students by his own creative example.

                           laugh this off. There is a blot, and you know it! You feel like I do, I know, that

                           pioneers were. We hold the common denominator in the hollow of our hands and as a
                           group we refuse to make it manifest. There can be only one answer—we do not because

                           at his own expense after being dropped from the Federal Art Project last August because
                           it was discovered only citizens are allowed to work on the Project. His heroic figure
                           of American youth, cut direct from a block of stone which weighed more than three
                           tons before carving, is now on view in connection with the Museum’s W.P.A. show.

                        <p id="d47302e2067">Hirshman’s background is strictly—Art and Philadelphia, beginning with the Graphic
                           Sketch Club. He gave up painting several years ago and made three films with Jo Gerson
                           and Lewis Jacobs, the latter founder and editor of “Experimental Cinema”. From the
                           film, Hirshman turned to the use of cartoon and gradually worked out his present individual
                           method of three-dimensional caricature, an example of which is reproduced here in
                           the portrait of Harpo Marx. When he did “Haille Selassie”, Vanity Fair bought it and
                           used it in its last issue. The Associated and United Press flashed reproductions of
                           it from coast to coast by wirephoto for use in all its newspapers and Hirshman posed
                           for a clip in the newsreels.

                        <p id="d47302e2096">You will feel that you have known Adolph Borie well, when you have read George Biddle’s
                           book, “Adolph Borie”, published by the American Federation of Arts, Washington, D.
                           C.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2099">Borie was born in Philadelphia in 1877, received his education at the University of
                           Pennsylvania; in 1896 he studied at The Academy under William M. Chase and Thomas
                           Anshutz. In 1899 Borie studied in Munich where he remained until his return to Philadelphia
                           in 1902. The remainder of his life was spent in Philadelphia and New York, punctuated
                           by travel.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2102">To list the prizes and medals awarded the man Borie during his full and vigorous life
                           would more than fill this column. It is curious however in the light of public recognition
                           of his work how exceedingly little seems to have been known concerning his most pertinent
                           art experiments. His portraits, for which he is known chiefly, represent only a fraction
                           of his artistic expression. As is so frequently the case the conservative in Borie
                           profited from the work of the radicals, but the radical painters were inclined to
                           disdain his work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2106">Mr. Biddle tells us that Borie was subjected to three deep influences, the Munich
                           School, French Impressionism, and Paris Modernism. “Through his eclectic sensitivity
                           sometimes one, sometimes another of these influences was dominant. But throughout
                           and from the earliest days he was always a colorist, individual, sensitive, rich.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2109">“In estimating Borie’s importance, many friends and critics have tried to separate
                           the portraitist from the artist, usually depreciating one side of him at the expense
                           of the other. I believe we should think of both expressions as equally important parts
                           of the man”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2112">It is this extreme versatility that makes Borie such an astounding personality. It
                           was not until after his death in 1934, however, that the general public had an adequate
                           opportunity to appreciate the artist’s experiments outside the realm of portraiture.
                           That opportunity was in the form of a memorial exhibition at the Pennsylvania Museum
                           of Art.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2115">There is a profusion of fine black and white reproductions of Adolph Borie’s work
                           in Mr. Biddle’s book that, while they undoubtedly lose much because of the absence
                           of color, give a splendid resumé of the artist’s ventures in the field of Modernism.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2118">This reviewer has acquired unto himself a considerable reputation as a “Doodler”.
                           In case there be any benighted readers among us who are not acquainted with doodling,
                           it is the practice of nervously scribbling with pen or pencil upon paper, desk tops,
                           telephone booth walls, etc. Seriously, doodling as it has come to be called, is something
                           of a psychic phenomenon. It finds its origin in the subconscious mind. When you talk
                           on the telephone your conscious mind is completely absorbed in understanding and being
                           understood, yet all the while your subconscious mind is making graphic notes on the
                           handiest material.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2121">That is why we are so interested in “Art and the Subconscious” published by the Research
                           Studio, Maitland, Florida with thirty-eight reproductions of water colors by Andre
                           Smith. Mr. Smith tells us that they are totally unconscious reproductions, being recordings
                           of his subconscious, and not “drawings”. The book contains an explanation by Mr. Smith
                           which seemed quite clear and logical to this reader. Let me quote:
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2125">“What happened was simple enough. I took a blank sheet of drawing paper, the kind
                           that I use for water colors, thumb-tacked it to the board, and, with pencil in hand,
                           proclaimed (inwardly, of course) my readiness and willingness to proceed and then
                           I waited.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2128">“Later I realized that I had quite unconsciously hit upon the right approach to this
                           method of ‘Automatic’ drawing; I had expressed a readiness, willingness, and ‘Waitingness’.
                           I put myself at once in a mood halfway between passive indifference and hopeful expectancy.
                           And so when, after a short pause, it ‘came to me’ to draw a gothic arch, I followed
                           this suggestion in faint pencil line on the blank sheet before me.” This marked the
                           beginning of a truly remarkable experiment. We find Gothic arches, American flags,
                           snakes, skeletons, stars suspended by balloons, all united in curiously unified compositions.
                           The pictures all have titles which, Mr. Smith explains, he gave them primarily for
                           exhibition purposes after the entire group was completed. However, these titles too,
                           he explains, were the result of “passive waiting”.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2131">This art might be placed somewhere between Goya and surrealism. The picture entitled,
                           “What makes you think you can take it with you”, showing a skeleton lying with its
                           head on a tomb stone in a boat filled with gold, reminded us particularly of Goya’s
                           famous plate in which the finger writes upon the tomb stone the word “Naja” (nothing).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d47302e2134">Printed in a limited edition of five hundred copies, this book, we venture to predict,
                           will take its place among the important creations of our time.
