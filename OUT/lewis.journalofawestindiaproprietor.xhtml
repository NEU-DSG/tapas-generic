                           But I thought, that the advance was dearly purchased 
                           by the terrible night which the storm
                           made us pass. The wind roaring, the waves dashing
                           against the stern, till at last they beat in the
                           quarter gallery; the ship, too, rolling from side 
                           to side, as if every moment she were going to roll
                           over and over! 
                           <persName id="d72447e910" ref="#mr_j_0001">Mr. J―</persName> was heaved off
                           one of the sofas, and rolled along, till he was
                           stopped by the table. He then took his seat upon
                           the floor, as the more secure position; and, half an
                           hour afterwards, another heave chucked him back
                           again upon the sofa. The

                           could not relight it with the other: so the

                           came to do it; when a sudden heel of the ship
                           made him extinguish the second candle, tumbled 
                           him upon the sofa on which I was lying, and made 
                           the candle which he had brought with him fly out
                           of the candlestick, through a cabin window at his
                           elbow; and thus we were all left in the dark.
                           Then the intolerable noise! the cracking of bulkheads!
                           the sawing of ropes! the screeching of the

                           flying to one end of the room; and the next moment

                           perpetual tempestuous weather which we have 
                           experienced has so shaken the planks of the vessel,
                           that the sea enters at all quarters. About one
                           o'clock in the morning I was saluted by a stream
                           of water, which poured down exactly upon my
                           face, and obliged me to shift my lodgings. The
                           
                           <anonPers id="d72447e1240">carpenter</anonPers> had been made aware that there was a 
                           leak in my cabin, and ordered to caulk the seams;
                           but, I suppose, he thought that during only a two
                           months' voyage, the rain might very possibly never
                           find out the hole, and that it would be quite time
                           enough to apply the remedy when I should have
                           felt the inconvenience. The best is, that the 
                           
                           <anonPers id="d72447e1243">carpenter</anonPers> happening to be at work in the next
                           cabin when the water came down upon me, I 
                           desired him to call my 
                           <anonPers id="d72447e1246">servant</anonPers>, in order that I
                           might get up, on account of the leak; on which he 
                           told me 
                           <said id="d72447e1250" style="quotes; " direct="false">that the leak could not be helped;</said>
                           grumbled a good deal at calling up the

                           and seemed to think me not a little unreasonable
                           for not lying quietly, and suffering myself to be 
                           pumped upon by this shower-bath of his own providing.

                           a gun, which drove against him, threw him off his

                           which had never struck me before. The

                           egregious blunder, he never so much as hints a

                           has stated, but only begs to know her reasons for
                           taking a step so extraordinary.

                           (the cabin boy), and his friend the

                           came on deck, and sat themselves down on a 
                           gun-carriage, to read by the light of the moon. I 
                           looked at the

                           He said that it had been made a present to him,
                           and so he had read it almost through, for he had

                           that it was feared he would break

                           of this fish: while covered by the waves he was 
                           entirely green; and as the water gave him a case
                           of transparent crystal, he really looked like one
                           solid piece of living emerald; when he sprang into 
                           the air, or swam fatigued upon the surface, his fins 
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d72447e2466"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>

                           alone preserved their green, and the rest of his body
                           appeared to be of the brightest yellow, his scales shining
                           like gold wherever they caught the sun; while
                           the blood which, as long as he remained in the sea, 
                           continued to spout in great quantities, forced its
                           way upwards through the water, like a wreath of
                           crimson smoke, and then dispersed itself in separate
                           globules among the spray. From the great loss of 
                           blood, his colours soon became paler; but when he 
                           was at length safely landed on deck, and beating
                           himself to death against the floring, agony renewed 
                           all the lustre of his tints: his fins were still
                           green and his body golden, except his back, which
                           was olive, shot with bright deep blue; his head and 
                           belly became silvery, and the spots with which the 
                           latter was mottled changed, with incessant rapidity,
                           from deep olive to the most beautiful azure. Gradually 
                           his brilliant tints disappeared: they were
                           succeeded by one uniform shade of slate-colour;
                           and when he was quite dead, he exhibited nothing
                           but dirty brown and dull dead white. As soon as
                           all was over with him, the first thing done was to
                           convert one of his fins into the resemblance of a

                           eight months hence. The sky this evening presented
                           us with quite a new phenomenon, a rose-
                           coloured moon: she is to be at her full to-morrow;
                           and this afternoon, about half-past four, she rose
                           like a disk of silver, perfectly white and colourless;
                           but, as she was exactly opposite to the sun at the 
                           time of his setting, the reflection of his rays spread
                           a kind of pale blush over her orb, which produced
                           an effect as beautiful as singular. Indeed, the size
                           and inconceivable brilliance of the sun, the clearness
                           of the atmosphere, which had assumed a faint
                           greenish hue, and was entirely without a cloud,
                           the smoothness of the ocean, and the aforesaid
                           rose-coloured moon, altogether rendered this sunset
                           the most magical in effect that I ever beheld; and
                           it was with great reluctance that I was called away
                           from admiring it, to ascertain whether the merits 
                           of our new acquaintance, the 
                           <fauna id="d72447e2510">dolphin</fauna>, extended
                           any further than his skin. Part of him, which was
                           boiled for yesterday's dinner, was rather coarse
                           and dry, and might have been mistaken for
                           indifferent

                           <food id="d72447e2519">pepper and salt</food>, had improved him wonderfully;

                           In point of heat, there is no difference between the 
                           days and the nights; or if there is any, it is that
                           the nights are rather the hottest of the two. The
                           lightning is incessant, and it does not show itself
                           forked or in flashes, but in wide sheets of mild blue
                           light, which spread themselves at once over the sky
                           and sea; and, for the moment which they last,
                           make all the objects around as distinct as daylight.

                           o'clock, and during her absence the size and brilliancy
                           of the stars are admirable. In

                           About three years ago a fleet of merchantmen was 
                           becalmed near 
                           <placeName id="d72447e3267">St. Vincent's</placeName>: in a few days after
                           their arrival, there happened a violent eruption of
                           a volcano in that island, nor was it long before a
                           favourable breeze sprang up. Unluckily, one of
                           the ships had anchored rather nearer to the shore 
                           than the others, and was at the distance of about
                           
                           <measure id="d72447e3270">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> from the stream of the

                           crew, by tacking, by towing, or otherwise, ever
                           enable the vessel to conquer that

                           as if there were not such a thing as a 
                           breath of wind in the universe; and on the one 
                           hand she had the mortification to see the rest of the 
                           merchantmen, with their convoy (for it was in the 
                           very heat of the war), sail away with all their canvass
                           spread and swelling; while, on the other
                           hand, the 
                           <rs id="d72447e3277" type="persGroup">sailors</rs> had the comfortable possibility of

                              Bay
                           </placeName>, about a mile from my own estate, a
                           figure presented itself before me, I really think
                           the most picturesque that I ever beheld: it was 
                           a

                           <anonPers id="d72447e5156">overseer</anonPers> of a neighbouring estate had obtained
                           my permission to exchange for

                           him; but, as yet, he has been unable to procure a
                           substitute, owing to the difficulty of purchasing
                           single negroes, and 
                           <persName id="d72447e5166" ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary Wiggins</persName> is still my slave.
                           However, as she is considered as being manumitted,
                           she had not dared present herself at 
                           <placeName id="d72447e5169">Cornwall</placeName> on
                           my arrival, lest she should have been considered as
                           an intruder; but she now threw herself in my way to
                           tell me how glad she was to see me, for that she
                           had always thought till now (which is the general
                           complaint) that

                           By this universal complaint, it appears
                           that, while

                           contemptuous reproaches that can be cast upon

                           hear on Wednesday evening that my carriage was

                           to be dark—it was more of an ash-dove colour
                           than any thing else; her teeth were admirable,
                           both for colour and shape; her eyes equally mild
                           and bright; and her face merely broad enough
                           to give it all possible softness and grandness of
                           contour: her air and countenance would have

                              strongly tempted to set him at liberty at once;
                              but if I were to begin in that way, there would
                              be no stopping; and it would be doing a kindness
                              to an individual at the expense of all my other

                              I must either contrive to cultivate my estate 
                              with fewer hands—or must cease to cultivate
                              it altogether—and, from inability to maintain
                              them, send my

                              selves—which, as two thirds of them have been

                              cruel. Even when

                           more than three persons at a time: to me they appeared
                           to be movements entirely dictated by the
                           caprice of the moment; but I am told there is
                           a regular figure, and that the least mistake, or a
                           single false step, is immediately noticed by the rest.
                           I could indeed sometimes fancy, that one story
                           represented an old duenna guarding a girl from
                           a lover; and another, the pursuit of a young woman
                           by two suitors, the one young and the other old;

                           told, that they have dances which not only represent
                           courtship and marriage, but being brought 
                           to bed. Their music consisted of nothing but

                           principal part of the music to which they dance is
                           vocal; one girl generally singing two lines by
                           herself, and being answered by a chorus. To 
                           make out either the rhyme of the air, or meaning
                           of the words, was out of the question. But one

                           rushed upon him, and lifted the bill-hook, with

                           <rs id="d72447e7213" type="persGroup">his shipmates</rs>, it appeared that he had

                           For my own part, the symptoms of 
                           his complaint were such as to make me suspect
                           him of having tasted something poisonous, especially as,
                           just before his first fit, he had been observed
                           in

                           all, that nothing could possibly have induced him

                           just as well as blacks and whites; but they

                           and thus their children are very difficult to rear.
                           On a sugar estate one black is considered as more
                           than equal to two mulattoes. Beautiful as are their
                           forms in general, and easy and graceful as are their
                           movements (which, indeed, appear to me so striking,
                           that they cannot fail to excite the admiration

                           greatly increased. It runs away on being encountered,
                           and conceals itself; and it is only dangerous
                           if trampled upon by accident, or if attacked; but
                           then its bite is a dreadful one, not only from its
                           tongue being armed with a sting (the venom of 
                           which is very powerful, although not mortal), but
                           from its teeth being so brittle that they generally
                           break in the wound, and as it is hardly possible to
                           extract the pieces entirely, the wound corrupts,
                           and becomes an incurable sore of the most offensive
                           nature. Luckily, these reptiles are very scarce,
                           but nothing can exceed the terror and aversion in
                           which they are held by the

                           and the claws of the feet very long and sharp:
                           altogether it is a very hideous and disgusting creature.

                           character for probity and humility. He was
                           both attorney and overseer; and it was a particular

                           although it was so evident that nothing was

                           never been in the bush to hurt him, nor any where
                           else; on the contrary, that he had always loved
                           him, and wished him well; and that he now begged
                           him to be friends with him again, to forget and forgive
                           all former quarrels, and to accept the hand
                           which he offered him in all sincerity. The sick

                           I would buy for him exactly a set of such

                           should bring them to his house, to show that he

                           and I then desired to see them shake hands. They
                           did so, with much apparent cordiality;

                           seems that this morning,

                           on that station insisted on their doing their duty,
                           a little fierce young devil of a 
                           <persName id="d72447e10006" ref="#whaunica_0001">Miss Whaunica</persName> flew
                           at his throat, and endeavoured to strangle him:
                           the agent was obliged to be called in, and, at
                           length, this petticoat rebellion was subdued, and
                           every thing went on as usual. I have, in consequence,
                           assured the women, that since they will 
                           not be managed by fair treatment, I must have
                           recourse to other measures; and that, if any similar
                           instance of misconduct should take place, I
                           was determined, on my return from

                           more. This threat, at the time, seemed to produce
                           a great effect; all hands were clasped, and all voices
                           were raised, imploring me not to leave them, and
                           assuring me, that in future they would do their
                           work quietly and willingly. But whether the impression
                           will last beyond the immediate moment is
                           a point greatly to be doubted.

                           every thing that was right and necessary.

                           too, the runaway cooper, who had applied to me to
                           obtain his pardon, had been suffered to return to his
                           work unpunished; and as it had been found that
                           his flight had in a great measure been occasioned by
                           his being in a bad state of health, which rendered

                           one in the trade. But I found it a more difficult
                           matter to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the
                           charges brought to me on Sunday last: the books
                           positively contradicted them, but the register

                           <measure id="d72447e11282">twelve miles</measure> from the
                           
                           <rs id="d72447e11286" type="place">toll-house</rs>, where we rested for the night. To be
                           sure, the road was so rough, that it was enough
                           to make one envy the 
                           <rs id="d72447e11289" type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> women, who,
                           having no souls at all, could not possibly have them
                           jolted out of their bodies; but the beauty of the
                           scenery amply rewarded us for our bruised sides
                           and battered backs. The road was, for the most 
                           part, bounded by lofty rocks on one side, and a
                           deep precipice on the other, and bordered with a
                           profusion of noble trees and 
                           <flora id="d72447e11292">flowering shrubs</flora> in
                           great variety. In particular, I was struck with the 
                           picturesque appearance of some wild 
                           <flora id="d72447e11295">fig-trees</flora> of 
                           singular size and beauty. Although there were 
                           only two of us, besides 
                           <rs id="d72447e11298" type="persGroup">servants</rs>, we found it necessary
                           to employ seven

                           and, as our cavalcade wound along through the
                           mountains, the 
                           <rs id="d72447e11308" type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> look of our

                           us quite the appearance of a caravan; nor should I
                           have been greatly surprised to see a trap-door open
                           in the middle of the road, and

                           of beauty, when compared with the north; however,
                           it certainly seemed to me more beautiful than

                           has no recommendation whatever; the houses are
                           mostly built of wood: the streets are very irregular
                           and narrow; every alternate building is in a ruinous
                           state, and the whole place wears an air of gloom
                           and melancholy. The 
                           <rs id="d72447e11375" type="place">government house</rs> is a large
                           clumsy-looking brick building, with a portico the 
                           stucco of which has suffered by the weather, and it
                           can advance no pretensions to architectural beauty.

                           time. Nor was he married; for he was still young,
                           and afraid that he could not break off his bad habits,
                           and be contented to live with no other woman than 
                           his wife; and so he thought it better not to become

                           to be built over the river, but a storm had demolished

                           throw itself upon its back in order to take wing;
                           but this I have, again, heard others contradict.
                           When confined in a glass, the light seems almost
                           extinguished; nothing can be discered but two
                           pale yellow spots; but on being pressed by the hand
                           it becomes more brilliant than any emerald, and
                           when on the wing it seems entirely composed of 
                           the most beautifully coloured fire.

                           innocence, although some suspicion attached

                           her conduct through the whole transaction. She

                           witnessed his agonies without one expression of

                           the room, she pretended to be fast asleep, and not
                           to hear what was said to her. Even since her imprisonment,
                           she could never be prevailed upon to

                           no lawyers employed on either side; consequently

                           at all the worse. Nobody appeared to be either for
                           or against the prisoner; the only object of all present
                           was evidently to come at the truth, and I sincerely
                           believe that they obtained their object. The 
                           only part of the trial of which I disapproved was the
                           ordering the culprit to such immediate execution,

                           too narrow to admit of his turning round to go
                           back again, his escape was impossible, and a ball,
                           lodged near his eye, soon put an end to him. I
                           went over to see him this morning; but I was not
                           contented with merely seeing him, so I begged to
                           have a 
                           <food id="d72447e13362">steak</food> cut off for me, brought it home, and
                           ordered it to be broiled for dinner. 
                           <anonPers id="d72447e13365">One of the

                           news spread through the estate like wildfire; and
                           I had immediately half a dozen different deputations,
                           all hoping that

                           eating the alligator, for it was poisonous. However,
                           I was obstinate, and found the taste of the flesh,
                           when broiled with 
                           <food id="d72447e13371">pepper and salt</food>, and assisted by

                           the consistence of the meat was disagreeable, being
                           as tough as a piece of 
                           <food id="d72447e13377">eel-skin</food>. Perhaps any body
                           who wishes to eat alligator stakes in perfection,
                           ought to keep them for two or three days before
                           dressing them; or the animal's age might be in fault,
                           for the fellow was so old that he had scarcely a tooth
                           in his head; I therefore contented myself with two

                           a rascal, sluiced him with the dirty water, and
                           finally knocked him down with the broom. The
                           
                           <rs id="d72447e13430" type="properAdjective">African</rs> came to me instantly;

                           who were examined separately, proved the truth of

                           witnesses to the assertion; and that, if he
                           grounded his claim to being believed merely upon
                           his having a white skin, he would find that, on
                           
                           <placeName id="d72447e13441">Cornwall</placeName> estate at least, that claim would not be 
                           admitted. The fact was established as evident as
                           the sun; and nothing should induce me to retain
                           him on my property, except his finding some means
                           of appeasing the injured negro, and prevailing on
                           him to intercede in his behalf. This was an humiliation
                           to which he could not bring himself to
                           stoop; and, accordingly, the man has left the

                           would have been unsuccessful; for when one

                           conceal his having such a complaint, till it
                           has made so great a progress that its effects are

                           perceived by others. Even then, they will never
                           acknowledge the way in which they have contracted 
                           it; but men and women, whose noses 
                           almost shake while speaking to you, will still insist
                           upon it that their illness arises from catching a cold,
                           or from a strain in lifting a weight, or, in short,
                           from any cause except the true one. Yet why
                           they act thus it is difficult to imagine; for certainly
                           it does not arise from shame.

                        <p id="d72447e14772">Indeed, it is one of their singular obstinacies,
                           that, however ill they may be, they scarcely ever
                           will confess to the physician what is really the
                           matter with them on their first coming into the
                           hospital, but will rather assign some other cause
                           for their being unwell than the true one; and it is
                           only by cross-questioning, that their superintendents
                           are able to understand the true nature of their
                           case. Perhaps this duplicity is occasioned by
                           fear; for in any bodily pain it is not possible to be
                           more cowardly than the negro; and I have heard
                           strong young men, while the tears were running
                           down their cheeks, scream and roar as if a limb
                           was amputating, although 
                           <anonPers id="d72447e14774">the doctoress</anonPers> was only 
                           applying a poultice to a whitlow on the finger. I
                           suppose, therefore, that dread of the pain of some
                           unknown mode of treatment makes them conceal
                           their real disease, and name some other, of which
                           they know the cure to be unattended with bodily
                           suffering or long restraint. In the disease I allude
                           to, such a motive would operate with peculiar

                           wished to thank me, the words in which he thought

                           to credit. His pulse was regular, his skin

                           declared nothing whatever to be the matter with
                           him. However, on my arrival, he began to moan,
                           and groan, and grunt, and all so lamentably, that
                           every soul in 
                           <rs id="d72447e14961" type="place">the hospital</rs>, sick or well, burst into
                           a fit of laughter. For my part, I told him that I
                           really believed him to be very bad; and that, as he 
                           met with no sympathy in

                           I had a comfortable bed made for him 
                           in a separate house. Here he was plentifully supplied

                           enjoy perfect repose during his illness, he doors
                           were kept locked, and no person allowed to disturb
                           him with their conversation; while, by

                           doses of

                           not suffer him to get well all at once; so yesterday
                           he still complained of a pain in his chest, and
                           begged to be blooded. His request was granted;
                           and the blood proved to be so pure and well-
                           coloured, that every one exclaimed, that for a man 
                           who had such good blood to part with it so wantonly
                           was a shame and a folly. The fellow was
                           at length convinced that his tricks would serve no
                           object; and this morning he begged me to suffer
                           him to return to his duty, and promised that I
                           should have no more cause to complain of him.
                           So I contented to consider his cure as completed,
                           and he set off for the field perfectly satisfied with
                           his release.

                           and by their insidious practices and dangerous

                           and to promoted disorder and confusion.

                           to infringe them; and that, otherwise, it was imperiously

                           persons; the jury always making proportionable
                           abatements of belief, from bearing in mind the bad
                           habits of most negroes, their general want of probity
                           and good faith in every respect, and their
                           total ignorance of the nature of religious obligations.
                           At the same time, these defects may be
                           counterbalanced by the respectable character of the
                           particular negro; by the strength of corroborating
                           circumstance; and, finally, by the irresistable conviction
                           which his evidence may leave upon the 
                           minds of the jury. They are not obliged to

                           a negro witness, but I maintain that he ought to

                           <emph id="d72447e15065" style="font-style: italic;">heard</emph>, and then let the jury give their verdict
                           according to their conscience. But this, in the

                           Besides the distance saved, there was another reason

                           he soon managed to clear up the mystery: and

                           better luck in a similar attempt on board of a
                           different vessel. He contrived to secrete himself

                           there came on a gale of wind truly tremendous.

                           a mountain of waves broke over the vessel, and
                           pouring itself through the sky-light, paid the same

                              she conceived that these must needs be the most
                              valuable; and, therefore, made a point of selecting
                              those three which seemed to be the greatest gossips

                              it best not to return into the hut, and, accordingly,
                              set forward on her return home; but she had not
                              yet reached the

                              her to break one of the 
                              <food id="d72447e18143">eggs</food>. To her 
                              infinite disappointment it proved to be empty;
                              and she soon found cause to wish that the second
                              had been empty too; for on her dashing it against the 
                              the ground, out came an enormous

                              which flew at her with dreadful hissings. Away

                              stumbled over it, and fell. In her fall the third

                              would have obtained the same good fortune; but
                              that as she had shown her nothing but rudeness, and
                              told her nothing but lies, she must be contented to
                              carry home nothing but the empty

                           voyage I was extremely afflicted with sea-sickness;
                           and between eight o'clock on a Monday morning,
                           and twelve on the following Thursday, I actually
                           brought up almost a thousand lines, with rhymes at
                           the end of them. Having nothing better to do at
                           present, I may as well copy them into this book. 
                           Composed with such speed, and under such circumstances,
                           I take it for granted that the verses
                           cannot be very good; but let them be ever so bad,
                           I defy any one to be more sick while reading them
