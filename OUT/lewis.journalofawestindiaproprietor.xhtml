                           and came bearing down close upon us. The danger,
                           indeed, from the difference of size, was all
                           upon the side of the brig; but, luckly, the vessels

                           A boat came from the shore this evening, and reported
                           that several vessels have been dismasted, 
                           lost their anchors, and injured in various ways. A

                           But I thought, that the advance was dearly purchased 
                           by the terrible night which the storm
                           made us pass. The wind roaring, the waves dashing
                           against the stern, till at last they beat in the
                           quarter gallery; the ship, too, rolling from side 
                           to side, as if every moment she were going to roll
                           over and over!

                           the floor, as the more secure position; and, half an
                           hour afterwards, another heave chucked him back
                           again upon the sofa. The

                           of the candles, and both being tied to the table,
                           could not relight it with the other: so the

                           came to do it; when a sudden heel of the ship
                           made him extinguish the second candle, tumbled 
                           him upon the sofa on which I was lying, and made 
                           the candle which he had brought with him fly out
                           of the candlestick, through a cabin window at his
                           elbow; and thus we were all left in the dark.
                           Then the intolerable noise! the cracking of bulkheads!
                           the sawing of ropes! the screeching of the

                           flying to one end of the room; and the next moment

                           time yesterday, was rent from top to bottom; and

                           perpetual tempestuous weather which we have 
                           experienced has so shaken the planks of the vessel,
                           that the sea enters at all quarters. About one
                           o'clock in the morning I was saluted by a stream
                           of water, which poured down exactly upon my
                           face, and obliged me to shift my lodgings. The
                           
                           <anonPers id="d146658e1240">carpenter</anonPers> had been made aware that there was a 
                           leak in my cabin, and ordered to caulk the seams;
                           but, I suppose, he thought that during only a two
                           months' voyage, the rain might very possibly never
                           find out the hole, and that it would be quite time
                           enough to apply the remedy when I should have
                           felt the inconvenience. The best is, that the 
                           
                           <anonPers id="d146658e1243">carpenter</anonPers> happening to be at work in the next
                           cabin when the water came down upon me, I 
                           desired him to call my 
                           <anonPers id="d146658e1246">servant</anonPers>, in order that I
                           might get up, on account of the leak; on which he 
                           told me 
                           <said id="d146658e1250" style="quotes; " direct="false">that the leak could not be helped;</said>
                           grumbled a good deal at calling up the

                           and seemed to think me not a little unreasonable
                           for not lying quietly, and suffering myself to be 
                           pumped upon by this shower-bath of his own providing.

                           a gun, which drove against him, threw him off his

                           he gorged a line which was fastened to the stern,

                           that it was feared he would break

                           can picture nothing more beautiful than the colours
                           of this fish: while covered by the waves he was 
                           entirely green; and as the water gave him a case
                           of transparent crystal, he really looked like one
                           solid piece of living emerald; when he sprang into 
                           the air, or swam fatigued upon the surface, his fins 
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d146658e2466"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>

                           alone preserved their green, and the rest of his body
                           appeared to be of the brightest yellow, his scales shining
                           like gold wherever they caught the sun; while
                           the blood which, as long as he remained in the sea, 
                           continued to spout in great quantities, forced its
                           way upwards through the water, like a wreath of
                           crimson smoke, and then dispersed itself in separate
                           globules among the spray. From the great loss of 
                           blood, his colours soon became paler; but when he 
                           was at length safely landed on deck, and beating
                           himself to death against the floring, agony renewed 
                           all the lustre of his tints: his fins were still
                           green and his body golden, except his back, which
                           was olive, shot with bright deep blue; his head and 
                           belly became silvery, and the spots with which the 
                           latter was mottled changed, with incessant rapidity,
                           from deep olive to the most beautiful azure. Gradually 
                           his brilliant tints disappeared: they were
                           succeeded by one uniform shade of slate-colour;
                           and when he was quite dead, he exhibited nothing
                           but dirty brown and dull dead white. As soon as
                           all was over with him, the first thing done was to
                           convert one of his fins into the resemblance of a

                           eight months hence. The sky this evening presented
                           us with quite a new phenomenon, a rose-
                           coloured moon: she is to be at her full to-morrow;
                           and this afternoon, about half-past four, she rose
                           like a disk of silver, perfectly white and colourless;
                           but, as she was exactly opposite to the sun at the 
                           time of his setting, the reflection of his rays spread
                           a kind of pale blush over her orb, which produced
                           an effect as beautiful as singular. Indeed, the size
                           and inconceivable brilliance of the sun, the clearness
                           of the atmosphere, which had assumed a faint
                           greenish hue, and was entirely without a cloud,
                           the smoothness of the ocean, and the aforesaid
                           rose-coloured moon, altogether rendered this sunset
                           the most magical in effect that I ever beheld; and
                           it was with great reluctance that I was called away
                           from admiring it, to ascertain whether the merits 
                           of our new acquaintance, the 
                           <fauna id="d146658e2510">dolphin</fauna>, extended
                           any further than his skin. Part of him, which was
                           boiled for yesterday's dinner, was rather coarse
                           and dry, and might have been mistaken for
                           indifferent

                           In point of heat, there is no difference between the 
                           days and the nights; or if there is any, it is that
                           the nights are rather the hottest of the two. The
                           lightning is incessant, and it does not show itself
                           forked or in flashes, but in wide sheets of mild blue
                           light, which spread themselves at once over the sky
                           and sea; and, for the moment which they last,
                           make all the objects around as distinct as daylight.
                           The moon now does not rise till near ten
                           o'clock, and during her absence the size and brilliancy
                           of the stars are admirable. In

                           About three years ago a fleet of merchantmen was 
                           becalmed near 
                           <placeName id="d146658e3267">St. Vincent's</placeName>: in a few days after
                           their arrival, there happened a violent eruption of
                           a volcano in that island, nor was it long before a
                           favourable breeze sprang up. Unluckily, one of
                           the ships had anchored rather nearer to the shore 
                           than the others, and was at the distance of about
                           
                           <measure id="d146658e3270">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> from the stream of the 
                           trade wind; nor could any possible efforts of the 
                           crew, by tacking, by towing, or otherwise, ever
                           enable the vessel to conquer that

                           as if there were not such a thing as a 
                           breath of wind in the universe; and on the one 
                           hand she had the mortification to see the rest of the 
                           merchantmen, with their convoy (for it was in the 
                           very heat of the war), sail away with all their canvass
                           spread and swelling; while, on the other
                           hand, the 
                           <rs id="d146658e3277" type="persGroup">sailors</rs> had the comfortable possibility of
                           being suffocated every moment by the clouds of
                           ashes which continued to fall on their deck every
                           moment, from the burning volcano, although they
                           were not nearer to

                           guns down the hatchways. It was near three 
                           hours before she filled, then down she went with a

                           land to-day; but on shipboard our not seeing a thing
                           
                           <emph id="d146658e3581" style="font-style: italic;">to-day</emph> by no means implies that we shall not see it

                           to conclude at noon, when the solar observation is
                           taken; and, therefore, the making land

                           dangerous, extremely narrow, and full of sunken

                           a sudden squall. We were, therefore, obliged to
                           drop anchor, and are now riding within a couple 
                           of miles of the shore, but with as utter an incapability

                           consequence was, that we were within an ace of
                           striking upon a rock, and very much obliged to
                           a sudden gust of wind, which, blowing right off
                           shore, blew us right out of the channel, and left us at

                           took up a fish of a very singular shape and most
                           brilliant colours, as it floated along upon the water.
                           It seemed to be gasping, and lay with its belly upwards;
                           it was supposed to have eaten something 
                           poisonous, as wherever it was touched it appeared
                           to be full of life, and squirted the water in our
                           faces with great spirit and dexterity. But no
                           sooner was he suffered to remain quiet in the tub,
                           than he turned upon his back and again was gasp-

                           intersected with red veins, under the belly, which
                           some imagined to proceed from a rupture, and to
                           be the occasion of his disease. But I could not

                           was quite solid to the touch; neither did the fish
                           appear to be sensible when it was pressed upon.
                           No one on board had ever seen this kind of fish

                           the fruit. Then the seeds, being of a dark purple,

                           have served me still. I really felt quite humiliated
                           at the moment, and was tempted to tell him,—

                           more than three persons at a time: to me they appeared
                           to be movements entirely dictated by the
                           caprice of the moment; but I am told there is
                           a regular figure, and that the least mistake, or a
                           single false step, is immediately noticed by the rest.
                           I could indeed sometimes fancy, that one story
                           represented an old duenna guarding a girl from
                           a lover; and another, the pursuit of a young woman
                           by two suitors, the one young and the other old;

                           but this might be only fancy. However, I am
                           told, that they have dances which not only represent
                           courtship and marriage, but being brought 
                           to bed. Their music consisted of nothing but

                           principal part of the music to which they dance is
                           vocal; one girl generally singing two lines by
                           herself, and being answered by a chorus. To 
                           make out either the rhyme of the air, or meaning
                           of the words, was out of the question. But one

                           requisite for their immediate occasions, they will

                           corpse will then refuse to go any road but the one
                           which passes by the habitation of the suspected

                           the most singular and exquisite flavour, perhaps, is

                           they are so passionately fond of salted provisions,
                           that, instead of giving them

                           just as well as blacks and whites; but they
                           are almost universally weak and effeminate persons,
                           and thus their children are very difficult to rear.
                           On a sugar estate one black is considered as more
                           than equal to two mulattoes. Beautiful as are their
                           forms in general, and easy and graceful as are their
                           movements (which, indeed, appear to me so striking,
                           that they cannot fail to excite the admiration
                           of any one who has ever looked with delight on

                           greatly increased. It runs away on being encountered,
                           and conceals itself; and it is only dangerous
                           if trampled upon by accident, or if attacked; but
                           then its bite is a dreadful one, not only from its
                           tongue being armed with a sting (the venom of 
                           which is very powerful, although not mortal), but
                           from its teeth being so brittle that they generally
                           break in the wound, and as it is hardly possible to
                           extract the pieces entirely, the wound corrupts,
                           and becomes an incurable sore of the most offensive
                           nature. Luckily, these reptiles are very scarce,
                           but nothing can exceed the terror and aversion in
                           which they are held by the

                           the room in terror, and was at the bottom of the

                           appeared to be like shagreen in looks and strength,
                           and was almost entirely composed of layers of very
                           small scales; the colours were brownish-yellow
                           and olive-green, the teeth numerous and piercing,
                           and the claws of the feet very long and sharp:
                           altogether it is a very hideous and disgusting creature.

                           his letters were filled with the most absolute injunctions

                           character for probity and humility. He was
                           both attorney and overseer; and it was a particular

                           and I then desired to see them shake hands. They

                           plainly, but shakes his head, and evidently gives
                           me to understand, that 
                           <rs id="d146658e9993" type="place">the estate</rs> cannot be
                           governed properly without the cart-whip. It
                           seems that this morning, 
                           <rs id="d146658e9996" type="persGroup">the women</rs>, one and all,

                           the slightest pretence: in consequence, the mill
                           was obliged to be stopped; and when

                           on that station insisted on their doing their duty,
                           a little fierce young devil of a 
                           <persName id="d146658e10006" ref="#whaunica_0001">Miss Whaunica</persName> flew
                           at his throat, and endeavoured to strangle him:
                           the agent was obliged to be called in, and, at
                           length, this petticoat rebellion was subdued, and
                           every thing went on as usual. I have, in consequence,
                           assured the women, that since they will 
                           not be managed by fair treatment, I must have
                           recourse to other measures; and that, if any similar
                           instance of misconduct should take place, I
                           was determined, on my return from

                           more. This threat, at the time, seemed to produce
                           a great effect; all hands were clasped, and all voices
                           were raised, imploring me not to leave them, and
                           assuring me, that in future they would do their
                           work quietly and willingly. But whether the impression
                           will last beyond the immediate moment is
                           a point greatly to be doubted.

                           every thing that was right and necessary.

                           too, the runaway cooper, who had applied to me to
                           obtain his pardon, had been suffered to return to his
                           work unpunished; and as it had been found that
                           his flight had in a great measure been occasioned by
                           his being in a bad state of health, which rendered

                           matter to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the

                           positively contradicted them, but the register

                           <measure id="d146658e11282">twelve miles</measure> from the
                           
                           <rs id="d146658e11286" type="place">toll-house</rs>, where we rested for the night. To be
                           sure, the road was so rough, that it was enough
                           to make one envy the 
                           <rs id="d146658e11289" type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> women, who,
                           having no souls at all, could not possibly have them
                           jolted out of their bodies; but the beauty of the
                           scenery amply rewarded us for our bruised sides
                           and battered backs. The road was, for the most 
                           part, bounded by lofty rocks on one side, and a
                           deep precipice on the other, and bordered with a
                           profusion of noble trees and 
                           <flora id="d146658e11292">flowering shrubs</flora> in
                           great variety. In particular, I was struck with the 
                           picturesque appearance of some wild 
                           <flora id="d146658e11295">fig-trees</flora> of 
                           singular size and beauty. Although there were 
                           only two of us, besides 
                           <rs id="d146658e11298" type="persGroup">servants</rs>, we found it necessary
                           to employ seven

                           and, as our cavalcade wound along through the
                           mountains, the 
                           <rs id="d146658e11308" type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> look of our

                           and of our kittereens (which are precisely the

                           us quite the appearance of a caravan; nor should I
                           have been greatly surprised to see a trap-door open
                           in the middle of the road, and

                           of beauty, when compared with the north; however,
                           it certainly seemed to me more beautiful than

                           has no recommendation whatever; the houses are
                           mostly built of wood: the streets are very irregular
                           and narrow; every alternate building is in a ruinous
                           state, and the whole place wears an air of gloom
                           and melancholy. The

                           clumsy-looking brick building, with a portico the

                           time. Nor was he married; for he was still young,
                           and afraid that he could not break off his bad habits,
                           and be contented to live with no other woman than

                           to be built over the river, but a storm had demolished

                           in perfection; but as soon as it is touched, the
                           
                           <fauna id="d146658e12446">fly</fauna> struggles violently, and bends itself together with
                           a clicking noise like the snap of a spring; and I
                           understand that this effort is necessary to set it in 
                           motion. It is sufficiently strong to turn itself upwards
                           with a single movement, if lying on its
                           back: some people say that it is always obliged to
                           throw itself upon its back in order to take wing;
                           but this I have, again, heard others contradict.
                           When confined in a glass, the light seems almost
                           extinguished; nothing can be discered but two
                           pale yellow spots; but on being pressed by the hand
                           it becomes more brilliant than any emerald, and
                           when on the wing it seems entirely composed of 
                           the most beautifully coloured fire.

                           innocence, although some suspicion attached

                           her conduct through the whole transaction. She

                           the room, she pretended to be fast asleep, and not
                           to hear what was said to her. Even since her imprisonment,
                           she could never be prevailed upon to

                           at all the worse. Nobody appeared to be either for

                           was evidently to come at the truth, and I sincerely
                           believe that they obtained their object. The 
                           only part of the trial of which I disapproved was the

                           shade or perspective; the hair was a large black
                           patch, and the face covered with an uniform layer
                           of flesh-colour, with a red spot in the centre of 
                           each cheek. As to likeness, there was not even
                           an attempt to take any. But still, such as they 
                           were, there were eyes, nose, and mouth, to be sure.

                           and that I wished to give them something more

                           from a large 
                           <fauna id="d146658e13358">alligator</fauna> which had wandered from
                           the morass, and, in the hope of finding his way to
                           the river, and swam up the mill-trench till he
                           found himself stopped by the grating; and the 
                           banks being too high for him to gain them by
                           leaping upwards, and the place of his confinement
                           too narrow to admit of his turning round to go
                           back again, his escape was impossible, and a ball,
                           lodged near his eye, soon put an end to him. I
                           went over to see him this morning; but I was not
                           contented with merely seeing him, so I begged to
                           have a

                           ordered it to be broiled for dinner.

                           I had immediately half a dozen different deputations,
                           all hoping that

                           eating the alligator, for it was poisonous. However,
                           I was obstinate, and found the taste of the flesh,
                           when broiled with

                           the consistence of the meat was disagreeable, being
                           as tough as a piece of

                           who wishes to eat alligator stakes in perfection,
                           ought to keep them for two or three days before

                           for the fellow was so old that he had scarcely a tooth
                           in his head; I therefore contented myself with two

                           finally knocked him down with the broom. The

                           admitted. The fact was established as evident as
                           the sun; and nothing should induce me to retain
                           him on my property, except his finding some means
                           of appeasing the injured negro, and prevailing on
                           him to intercede in his behalf. This was an humiliation
                           to which he could not bring himself to

                           would have been unsuccessful; for when one

                           extracted in time, the flesh around it corrupts, and
                           a sore ensues not easily to be cured. No vigilance
                           can prevent the attacks of the

                           regularly. The negroes are all provided
                           with small knives for the purpose of extracting
                           them: but as no pain is felt till the sore is produced, 
                           their extreme laziness frequently makes
                           them neglect that precaution, till all kinds of dirt
                           getting into the wound, increases the difficulty of
                           a cure; and sometimes the consequence is lameness

                           ragages among them; for although in this climate

                           cured in its beginning, the negro will most carefully 
                           conceal his having such a complaint, till it

                           perceived by others. Even then, they will never
                           acknowledge the way in which they have contracted 
                           it; but men and women, whose noses 
                           almost shake while speaking to you, will still insist
                           upon it that their illness arises from catching a cold,
                           or from a strain in lifting a weight, or, in short,
                           from any cause except the true one. Yet why
                           they act thus it is difficult to imagine; for certainly
                           it does not arise from shame.

                        <p id="d146658e14772">Indeed, it is one of their singular obstinacies,
                           that, however ill they may be, they scarcely ever
                           will confess to the physician what is really the
                           matter with them on their first coming into the
                           hospital, but will rather assign some other cause
                           for their being unwell than the true one; and it is
                           only by cross-questioning, that their superintendents
                           are able to understand the true nature of their
                           case. Perhaps this duplicity is occasioned by
                           fear; for in any bodily pain it is not possible to be
                           more cowardly than the negro; and I have heard
                           strong young men, while the tears were running
                           down their cheeks, scream and roar as if a limb
                           was amputating, although 
                           <anonPers id="d146658e14774">the doctoress</anonPers> was only 
                           applying a poultice to a whitlow on the finger. I
                           suppose, therefore, that dread of the pain of some
                           unknown mode of treatment makes them conceal
                           their real disease, and name some other, of which
                           they know the cure to be unattended with bodily
                           suffering or long restraint. In the disease I allude
                           to, such a motive would operate with peculiar

                           declared nothing whatever to be the matter with
                           him. However, on my arrival, he began to moan,
                           and groan, and grunt, and all so lamentably, that

                           a fit of laughter. For my part, I told him that I

                           I had a comfortable bed made for him 
                           in a separate house. Here he was plentifully supplied

                           not suffer him to get well all at once; so yesterday
                           he still complained of a pain in his chest, and
                           begged to be blooded. His request was granted;
                           and the blood proved to be so pure and well-
                           coloured, that every one exclaimed, that for a man 
                           who had such good blood to part with it so wantonly
                           was a shame and a folly. The fellow was
                           at length convinced that his tricks would serve no
                           object; and this morning he begged me to suffer
                           him to return to his duty, and promised that I
                           should have no more cause to complain of him.
                           So I contented to consider his cure as completed,
                           and he set off for the field perfectly satisfied with
                           his release.

                           time adverted to another subject connected with
                           the above. Many out of the country, and

                           and by their insidious practices and dangerous

                           and to promoted disorder and confusion.

                           abatements of belief, from bearing in mind the bad
                           habits of most negroes, their general want of probity
                           and good faith in every respect, and their
                           total ignorance of the nature of religious obligations.
                           At the same time, these defects may be
                           counterbalanced by the respectable character of the

                           circumstance; and, finally, by the irresistable conviction
                           which his evidence may leave upon the 
                           minds of the jury. They are not obliged to

                           according to their conscience. But this, in the

                           the responses. I explained the

                           the

                           slowly, in hopes of impressing it upon their memory.
                           Then came

                           they positively denied having tasted themselves;

                           several other people, and we were unanimous in
                           opinion, that it might have been mistaken for a

                           o'clock in the afternoon:

                           and port-holes, and sustain themselves upon the

                           arrive to take them off. As she filled, she gradually
                           sunk, and in a quarter of an hour she had 
                           disappeared totally.

                           he soon managed to clear up the mystery: and

                           better luck in a similar attempt on board of a
                           different vessel. He contrived to secrete himself

                           a mountain of waves broke over the vessel, and
                           pouring itself through the sky-light, paid the same

                              turned out of the house, and ordered not to return
                              till she could bring back as good a one. As she
                              was going along, weeping, she came to a large

                              made her gaze rather too earnestly, for the

                              yet reached the

                              and she soon found cause to wish that the second
                              had been empty too; for on her dashing it against the 
                              the ground, out came an enormous

                              which flew at her with dreadful hissings. Away

                              told her nothing but lies, she must be contented to
                              carry home nothing but the empty

                           voyage I was extremely afflicted with sea-sickness;
                           and between eight o'clock on a Monday morning,
                           and twelve on the following Thursday, I actually
                           brought up almost a thousand lines, with rhymes at
                           the end of them. Having nothing better to do at
                           present, I may as well copy them into this book. 
                           Composed with such speed, and under such circumstances,
                           I take it for granted that the verses
                           cannot be very good; but let them be ever so bad,
                           I defy any one to be more sick while reading them
