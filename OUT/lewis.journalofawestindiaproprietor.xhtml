                           lost their anchors, and injured in various ways. A

                           the trap-door of the store-hole open; of course, I 
                           immediately contrived to step into it, and was on 
                           the point of being precipitated to the bottom,

                           across the corner of the trap, and managed to support 
                           myself, till I could effect my escape with a

                           carried us through the

                           formed by the

                           <placeName id="d73163e907">Isle of Ushant</placeName>.  
                           But I thought, that the advance was dearly purchased 
                           by the terrible night which the storm
                           made us pass. The wind roaring, the waves dashing
                           against the stern, till at last they beat in the
                           quarter gallery; the ship, too, rolling from side 
                           to side, as if every moment she were going to roll
                           over and over! 
                           <persName id="d73163e910" ref="#mr_j_0001">Mr. J―</persName> was heaved off
                           one of the sofas, and rolled along, till he was
                           stopped by the table. He then took his seat upon
                           the floor, as the more secure position; and, half an
                           hour afterwards, another heave chucked him back
                           again upon the sofa. The 
                           <rs id="d73163e913" type="person" ref="#boyes_0001">captain</rs> snuffed out one
                           of the candles, and both being tied to the table,
                           could not relight it with the other: so the 
                           <anonPers id="d73163e916">steward</anonPers>
                           came to do it; when a sudden heel of the ship
                           made him extinguish the second candle, tumbled 
                           him upon the sofa on which I was lying, and made 
                           the candle which he had brought with him fly out
                           of the candlestick, through a cabin window at his
                           elbow; and thus we were all left in the dark.
                           Then the intolerable noise! the cracking of bulkheads!
                           the sawing of ropes! the screeching of the
                           tiller! the trampling of the 
                           <rs id="d73163e919" type="persGroup">sailors</rs>! the clattering
                           of the crockery! Every thing above deck and
                           below deck, all in motion at once! Chairs, writing-
                           desks, books, boxes, bundles, fire-irons and fenders,

                           time yesterday, was rent from top to bottom; and

                           perpetual tempestuous weather which we have 
                           experienced has so shaken the planks of the vessel,
                           that the sea enters at all quarters. About one
                           o'clock in the morning I was saluted by a stream
                           of water, which poured down exactly upon my
                           face, and obliged me to shift my lodgings. The
                           
                           <anonPers id="d73163e1240">carpenter</anonPers> had been made aware that there was a 
                           leak in my cabin, and ordered to caulk the seams;
                           but, I suppose, he thought that during only a two
                           months' voyage, the rain might very possibly never
                           find out the hole, and that it would be quite time
                           enough to apply the remedy when I should have
                           felt the inconvenience. The best is, that the 
                           
                           <anonPers id="d73163e1243">carpenter</anonPers> happening to be at work in the next
                           cabin when the water came down upon me, I 
                           desired him to call my 
                           <anonPers id="d73163e1246">servant</anonPers>, in order that I
                           might get up, on account of the leak; on which he 
                           told me 
                           <said id="d73163e1250" style="quotes; " direct="false">that the leak could not be helped;</said>
                           grumbled a good deal at calling up the

                           and seemed to think me not a little unreasonable
                           for not lying quietly, and suffering myself to be 
                           pumped upon by this shower-bath of his own providing.

                           a gun, which drove against him, threw him off his

                           is as disagreeable and perverse as it can well be;
                           indeed, I understand that in these latitudes

                           calms, which makes them particularly pleasant

                           and so he had read it almost through, for he had

                           he gorged a line which was fastened to the stern,

                           and strong fish, his efforts to escape were so powerful,
                           that it was feared he would break

                           struck, and three of the prongs were buried in his

                           can picture nothing more beautiful than the colours
                           of this fish: while covered by the waves he was 
                           entirely green; and as the water gave him a case
                           of transparent crystal, he really looked like one
                           solid piece of living emerald; when he sprang into 
                           the air, or swam fatigued upon the surface, his fins 
                           <span class="-teibp-pb" id="d73163e2466"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span>

                           alone preserved their green, and the rest of his body
                           appeared to be of the brightest yellow, his scales shining
                           like gold wherever they caught the sun; while
                           the blood which, as long as he remained in the sea, 
                           continued to spout in great quantities, forced its
                           way upwards through the water, like a wreath of
                           crimson smoke, and then dispersed itself in separate
                           globules among the spray. From the great loss of 
                           blood, his colours soon became paler; but when he 
                           was at length safely landed on deck, and beating
                           himself to death against the floring, agony renewed 
                           all the lustre of his tints: his fins were still
                           green and his body golden, except his back, which
                           was olive, shot with bright deep blue; his head and 
                           belly became silvery, and the spots with which the 
                           latter was mottled changed, with incessant rapidity,
                           from deep olive to the most beautiful azure. Gradually 
                           his brilliant tints disappeared: they were
                           succeeded by one uniform shade of slate-colour;
                           and when he was quite dead, he exhibited nothing
                           but dirty brown and dull dead white. As soon as
                           all was over with him, the first thing done was to
                           convert one of his fins into the resemblance of a

                           eight months hence. The sky this evening presented
                           us with quite a new phenomenon, a rose-
                           coloured moon: she is to be at her full to-morrow;
                           and this afternoon, about half-past four, she rose
                           like a disk of silver, perfectly white and colourless;
                           but, as she was exactly opposite to the sun at the 
                           time of his setting, the reflection of his rays spread
                           a kind of pale blush over her orb, which produced
                           an effect as beautiful as singular. Indeed, the size
                           and inconceivable brilliance of the sun, the clearness
                           of the atmosphere, which had assumed a faint
                           greenish hue, and was entirely without a cloud,
                           the smoothness of the ocean, and the aforesaid
                           rose-coloured moon, altogether rendered this sunset
                           the most magical in effect that I ever beheld; and
                           it was with great reluctance that I was called away
                           from admiring it, to ascertain whether the merits 
                           of our new acquaintance, the 
                           <fauna id="d73163e2510">dolphin</fauna>, extended
                           any further than his skin. Part of him, which was
                           boiled for yesterday's dinner, was rather coarse
                           and dry, and might have been mistaken for
                           indifferent

                           In point of heat, there is no difference between the 
                           days and the nights; or if there is any, it is that
                           the nights are rather the hottest of the two. The
                           lightning is incessant, and it does not show itself
                           forked or in flashes, but in wide sheets of mild blue
                           light, which spread themselves at once over the sky
                           and sea; and, for the moment which they last,
                           make all the objects around as distinct as daylight.
                           The moon now does not rise till near ten
                           o'clock, and during her absence the size and brilliancy
                           of the stars are admirable. In

                           About three years ago a fleet of merchantmen was 
                           becalmed near 
                           <placeName id="d73163e3267">St. Vincent's</placeName>: in a few days after
                           their arrival, there happened a violent eruption of
                           a volcano in that island, nor was it long before a
                           favourable breeze sprang up. Unluckily, one of
                           the ships had anchored rather nearer to the shore 
                           than the others, and was at the distance of about
                           
                           <measure id="d73163e3270">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> from the stream of the

                           crew, by tacking, by towing, or otherwise, ever
                           enable the vessel to conquer that

                           as if there were not such a thing as a 
                           breath of wind in the universe; and on the one 
                           hand she had the mortification to see the rest of the 
                           merchantmen, with their convoy (for it was in the 
                           very heat of the war), sail away with all their canvass
                           spread and swelling; while, on the other

                           <rs id="d73163e3277" type="persGroup">sailors</rs> had the comfortable possibility of
                           being suffocated every moment by the clouds of
                           ashes which continued to fall on their deck every
                           moment, from the burning volcano, although they
                           were not nearer to

                           a sudden gust of wind, which, blowing right off

                           some imagined to proceed from a rupture, and to
                           be the occasion of his disease. But I could not
                           discover any vestige of a wound; and the globule
                           was quite solid to the touch; neither did the fish
                           appear to be sensible when it was pressed upon.
                           No one on board had ever seen this kind of fish

                           in my life; the pulp is of a faint greenish yellow,

                           the fruit. Then the seeds, being of a dark purple,
                           present the happiest imitation of drops of clotted

                           appearance), when I had put a single bit into my

                           figure presented itself before me, I really think
                           the most picturesque that I ever beheld: it was 
                           a

                           <anonPers id="d73163e5156">overseer</anonPers> of a neighbouring estate had obtained
                           my permission to exchange for

                           substitute, owing to the difficulty of purchasing
                           single negroes, and 
                           <persName id="d73163e5166" ref="#mary_wiggins_0001">Mary Wiggins</persName> is still my slave.
                           However, as she is considered as being manumitted,
                           she had not dared present herself at 
                           <placeName id="d73163e5169">Cornwall</placeName> on
                           my arrival, lest she should have been considered as
                           an intruder; but she now threw herself in my way to
                           tell me how glad she was to see me, for that she
                           had always thought till now (which is the general
                           complaint) that

                           By this universal complaint, it appears

                           to be dark—it was more of an ash-dove colour
                           than any thing else; her teeth were admirable,
                           both for colour and shape; her eyes equally mild
                           and bright; and her face merely broad enough
                           to give it all possible softness and grandness of
                           contour: her air and countenance would have

                              it altogether—and, from inability to maintain
                              them, send my

                           more than three persons at a time: to me they appeared
                           to be movements entirely dictated by the
                           caprice of the moment; but I am told there is
                           a regular figure, and that the least mistake, or a
                           single false step, is immediately noticed by the rest.
                           I could indeed sometimes fancy, that one story
                           represented an old duenna guarding a girl from
                           a lover; and another, the pursuit of a young woman
                           by two suitors, the one young and the other old;

                           told, that they have dances which not only represent
                           courtship and marriage, but being brought 
                           to bed. Their music consisted of nothing but

                           principal part of the music to which they dance is
                           vocal; one girl generally singing two lines by
                           herself, and being answered by a chorus. To 
                           make out either the rhyme of the air, or meaning
                           of the words, was out of the question. But one

                           <rs id="d73163e7213" type="persGroup">his shipmates</rs>, it appeared that he had

                           him of having tasted something poisonous, especially as,
                           just before his first fit, he had been observed

                           all, that nothing could possibly have induced him

                           fell a victim to established habit? There is a question for
                           the bishops: those clergymen who reside constantly
                           on their livings (as all clergymen ought to do, or
                           they ought not to be clergymen), I shall, in charity,
                           believe to have something better to do with their 
                           time than to solve it.

                           and thus their children are very difficult to rear.
                           On a sugar estate one black is considered as more
                           than equal to two mulattoes. Beautiful as are their
                           forms in general, and easy and graceful as are their
                           movements (which, indeed, appear to me so striking,
                           that they cannot fail to excite the admiration

                           greatly increased. It runs away on being encountered,
                           and conceals itself; and it is only dangerous
                           if trampled upon by accident, or if attacked; but
                           then its bite is a dreadful one, not only from its
                           tongue being armed with a sting (the venom of 
                           which is very powerful, although not mortal), but
                           from its teeth being so brittle that they generally
                           break in the wound, and as it is hardly possible to
                           extract the pieces entirely, the wound corrupts,
                           and becomes an incurable sore of the most offensive
                           nature. Luckily, these reptiles are very scarce,
                           but nothing can exceed the terror and aversion in

                           and was almost entirely composed of layers of very

                           and the claws of the feet very long and sharp:
                           altogether it is a very hideous and disgusting creature.

                           character for probity and humility. He was
                           both attorney and overseer; and it was a particular

                           However, having already been so grossly deceived,
                           I will never again place implicit confidence in any

                           never been in the bush to hurt him, nor any where
                           else; on the contrary, that he had always loved
                           him, and wished him well; and that he now begged
                           him to be friends with him again, to forget and forgive
                           all former quarrels, and to accept the hand
                           which he offered him in all sincerity. The sick

                           I would buy for him exactly a set of such

                           should bring them to his house, to show that he
                           had rather give him things than take them away;
                           and I then desired to see them shake hands. They
                           did so, with much apparent cordiality;

                           then went back to his work; and this evening,

                           on that station insisted on their doing their duty,
                           a little fierce young devil of a 
                           <persName id="d73163e10006" ref="#whaunica_0001">Miss Whaunica</persName> flew
                           at his throat, and endeavoured to strangle him:
                           the agent was obliged to be called in, and, at
                           length, this petticoat rebellion was subdued, and
                           every thing went on as usual. I have, in consequence,
                           assured the women, that since they will

                           recourse to other measures; and that, if any similar
                           instance of misconduct should take place, I
                           was determined, on my return from

                           more. This threat, at the time, seemed to produce
                           a great effect; all hands were clasped, and all voices
                           were raised, imploring me not to leave them, and
                           assuring me, that in future they would do their
                           work quietly and willingly. But whether the impression
                           will last beyond the immediate moment is
                           a point greatly to be doubted.

                           beautiful scenes, from beginning to end. Instantly on

                           <geogName id="d73163e11273">May-day Mountains</geogName>, and it was not till after travelling

                           <measure id="d73163e11276">five and twenty miles</measure>, that we found ourselves
                           at the foot of them on the other side, at a place
                           called 
                           <placeName id="d73163e11279">Williamsfield</placeName>, about 
                           <measure id="d73163e11282">twelve miles</measure> from the
                           
                           <rs id="d73163e11286" type="place">toll-house</rs>, where we rested for the night. To be
                           sure, the road was so rough, that it was enough
                           to make one envy the 
                           <rs id="d73163e11289" type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> women, who,
                           having no souls at all, could not possibly have them
                           jolted out of their bodies; but the beauty of the
                           scenery amply rewarded us for our bruised sides
                           and battered backs. The road was, for the most 
                           part, bounded by lofty rocks on one side, and a
                           deep precipice on the other, and bordered with a
                           profusion of noble trees and 
                           <flora id="d73163e11292">flowering shrubs</flora> in
                           great variety. In particular, I was struck with the 
                           picturesque appearance of some wild 
                           <flora id="d73163e11295">fig-trees</flora> of 
                           singular size and beauty. Although there were 
                           only two of us, besides 
                           <rs id="d73163e11298" type="persGroup">servants</rs>, we found it necessary
                           to employ seven

                           and, as our cavalcade wound along through the
                           mountains, the

                           us quite the appearance of a caravan; nor should I
                           have been greatly surprised to see a trap-door open
                           in the middle of the road, and

                           whiskers make their appearance. Every one spoke

                           of beauty, when compared with the north; however,
                           it certainly seemed to me more beautiful than

                           has no recommendation whatever; the houses are
                           mostly built of wood: the streets are very irregular
                           and narrow; every alternate building is in a ruinous
                           state, and the whole place wears an air of gloom
                           and melancholy. The 
                           <rs id="d73163e11375" type="place">government house</rs> is a large
                           clumsy-looking brick building, with a portico the 
                           stucco of which has suffered by the weather, and it
                           can advance no pretensions to architectural beauty.

                           had the satisfaction of hearing from him, that for a

                           and for some offence so flagrant that it was impossible
                           to pass it over; and he assured me, that

                           time. Nor was he married; for he was still young,
                           and afraid that he could not break off his bad habits,
                           and be contented to live with no other woman than

                           asserts that mulattos never breed except

                           the assertion was a mistake, arising from such a
                           connection being very rarely formed; the females
                           generally preferring to live with white men, and
                           the brown men having thus no other resource

                           <fauna id="d73163e12440">fire-flies</fauna>, and in the
                           evening the hedges are all brilliant with their numbers.
                           In the day they seem to be torpid 
                           <fauna id="d73163e12443">beetles</fauna> of a
                           dull reddish colour, buat at night they become of a
                           shining purple. The fire proceeds from two small
                           spots in the back part of the head. It is yellow in
                           the light, and requires motion to throw out its radience
                           in perfection; but as soon as it is touched, the
                           
                           <fauna id="d73163e12446">fly</fauna> struggles violently, and bends itself together with
                           a clicking noise like the snap of a spring; and I
                           understand that this effort is necessary to set it in 
                           motion. It is sufficiently strong to turn itself upwards
                           with a single movement, if lying on its
                           back: some people say that it is always obliged to
                           throw itself upon its back in order to take wing;
                           but this I have, again, heard others contradict.
                           When confined in a glass, the light seems almost
                           extinguished; nothing can be discered but two
                           pale yellow spots; but on being pressed by the hand
                           it becomes more brilliant than any emerald, and
                           when on the wing it seems entirely composed of 
                           the most beautifully coloured fire.

                           be poison, and had given it to her master at

                           a fabrication: there was no doubt of the

                           innocence, although some suspicion attached

                           <anonPers id="d73163e12491">mother's</anonPers> influence; but as to the

                           her conduct through the whole transaction. She
                           stood by the bed to see 
                           <anonPers id="d73163e12495">her master</anonPers> drink the poison;
                           witnessed his agonies without one expression of
                           surprise or pity; and when she was ordered to leave
                           the room, she pretended to be fast asleep, and not
                           to hear what was said to her. Even since her imprisonment,
                           she could never be prevailed upon to 
                           say that she was sorry for

                           that when she went down the steps of the courthouse,

                           no lawyers employed on either side; consequently

                           at all the worse. Nobody appeared to be either for
                           or against the prisoner; the only object of all present
                           was evidently to come at the truth, and I sincerely
                           believe that they obtained their object. The 
                           only part of the trial of which I disapproved was the
                           ordering the culprit to such immediate execution,
                           that sufficient time was not allowed for the exercise

                           estate about four miles off, that the water-mill did
                           not work properly, and it was concluded that the
                           grating was clogged up with rubbish. To clear it

                           from a large 
                           <fauna id="d73163e13358">alligator</fauna> which had wandered from
                           the morass, and, in the hope of finding his way to
                           the river, and swam up the mill-trench till he
                           found himself stopped by the grating; and the 
                           banks being too high for him to gain them by
                           leaping upwards, and the place of his confinement
                           too narrow to admit of his turning round to go
                           back again, his escape was impossible, and a ball,
                           lodged near his eye, soon put an end to him. I
                           went over to see him this morning; but I was not
                           contented with merely seeing him, so I begged to
                           have a 
                           <food id="d73163e13362">steak</food> cut off for me, brought it home, and
                           ordered it to be broiled for dinner.

                           news spread through the estate like wildfire; and
                           I had immediately half a dozen different deputations,
                           all hoping that 
                           <distinct id="d73163e13368" type="dialect">massa</distinct> would not think of
                           eating the alligator, for it was poisonous. However,
                           I was obstinate, and found the taste of the flesh,
                           when broiled with 
                           <food id="d73163e13371">pepper and salt</food>, and assisted by

                           the consistence of the meat was disagreeable, being
                           as tough as a piece of 
                           <food id="d73163e13377">eel-skin</food>. Perhaps any body
                           who wishes to eat alligator stakes in perfection,
                           ought to keep them for two or three days before
                           dressing them; or the animal's age might be in fault,
                           for the fellow was so old that he had scarcely a tooth
                           in his head; I therefore contented myself with two
                           or three morsels; but

                           be very palatable; nor have the negroes who live
                           near morasses, the same objection with those of
                           
                           <placeName id="d73163e13395">Cornwall</placeName> to eating the flesh; it is, however, true

                           fully, will render the whole animal unfit for food;
                           and when this gall is reduced to powder, it forms a
                           poison of the most dangerous nature, as the negroes
                           know but too well.

                           I had given the most positive orders that no
                           person whatever should presume to strike a negro,

                           a rascal, sluiced him with the dirty water, and
                           finally knocked him down with the broom. The
                           
                           <rs id="d73163e13430" type="properAdjective">African</rs> came to me instantly;

                           who were examined separately, proved the truth of

                           witnesses to the assertion; and that, if he
                           grounded his claim to being believed merely upon
                           his having a white skin, he would find that, on
                           
                           <placeName id="d73163e13441">Cornwall</placeName> estate at least, that claim would not be 
                           admitted. The fact was established as evident as
                           the sun; and nothing should induce me to retain
                           him on my property, except his finding some means
                           of appeasing the injured negro, and prevailing on
                           him to intercede in his behalf. This was an humiliation
                           to which he could not bring himself to
                           stoop; and, accordingly, the man has left the

                           would have been unsuccessful; for when one

                           (although sown and cultivated with the utmost

                           be that of lameness. It is chiefly occasioned by

                           the feet to lay its eggs, and, if it be not carefully
                           extracted in time, the flesh around it corrupts, and
                           a sore ensues not easily to be cured. No vigilance
                           can prevent the attacks of the

                           soldiers, but the very cleanest persons of the highest
                           rank in society, are obliged to have their feet examined
                           regularly. The negroes are all provided
                           with small knives for the purpose of extracting
                           them: but as no pain is felt till the sore is produced, 
                           their extreme laziness frequently makes
                           them neglect that precaution, till all kinds of dirt
                           getting into the wound, increases the difficulty of
                           a cure; and sometimes the consequence is lameness
                           for life.

                           cured in its beginning, the negro will most carefully 
                           conceal his having such a complaint, till it

                           perceived by others. Even then, they will never
                           acknowledge the way in which they have contracted 
                           it; but men and women, whose noses 
                           almost shake while speaking to you, will still insist
                           upon it that their illness arises from catching a cold,
                           or from a strain in lifting a weight, or, in short,
                           from any cause except the true one. Yet why
                           they act thus it is difficult to imagine; for certainly
                           it does not arise from shame.

                        <p id="d73163e14772">Indeed, it is one of their singular obstinacies,
                           that, however ill they may be, they scarcely ever
                           will confess to the physician what is really the
                           matter with them on their first coming into the
                           hospital, but will rather assign some other cause
                           for their being unwell than the true one; and it is
                           only by cross-questioning, that their superintendents
                           are able to understand the true nature of their
                           case. Perhaps this duplicity is occasioned by
                           fear; for in any bodily pain it is not possible to be
                           more cowardly than the negro; and I have heard
                           strong young men, while the tears were running
                           down their cheeks, scream and roar as if a limb
                           was amputating, although 
                           <anonPers id="d73163e14774">the doctoress</anonPers> was only 
                           applying a poultice to a whitlow on the finger. I
                           suppose, therefore, that dread of the pain of some
                           unknown mode of treatment makes them conceal
                           their real disease, and name some other, of which
                           they know the cure to be unattended with bodily
                           suffering or long restraint. In the disease I allude
                           to, such a motive would operate with peculiar

                           declared nothing whatever to be the matter with

                           and groan, and grunt, and all so lamentably, that
                           every soul in 
                           <rs id="d73163e14961" type="place">the hospital</rs>, sick or well, burst into
                           a fit of laughter. For my part, I told him that I

                           I had a comfortable bed made for him 
                           in a separate house. Here he was plentifully supplied

                           were kept locked, and no person allowed to disturb
                           him with their conversation; while, by

                           not suffer him to get well all at once; so yesterday
                           he still complained of a pain in his chest, and
                           begged to be blooded. His request was granted;
                           and the blood proved to be so pure and well-
                           coloured, that every one exclaimed, that for a man 
                           who had such good blood to part with it so wantonly
                           was a shame and a folly. The fellow was
                           at length convinced that his tricks would serve no
                           object; and this morning he begged me to suffer
                           him to return to his duty, and promised that I
                           should have no more cause to complain of him.
                           So I contented to consider his cure as completed,
                           and he set off for the field perfectly satisfied with
                           his release.

                           <emph id="d73163e15058" style="font-style: italic;">heard</emph> against white
                           persons; the jury always making proportionable
                           abatements of belief, from bearing in mind the bad
                           habits of most negroes, their general want of probity
                           and good faith in every respect, and their
                           total ignorance of the nature of religious obligations.
                           At the same time, these defects may be
                           counterbalanced by the respectable character of the
                           particular negro; by the strength of corroborating
                           circumstance; and, finally, by the irresistable conviction
                           which his evidence may leave upon the 
                           minds of the jury. They are not obliged to 
                           <emph id="d73163e15061" style="font-style: italic;">believe</emph>
                           a negro witness, but I maintain that he ought to
                           be 
                           <emph id="d73163e15065" style="font-style: italic;">heard</emph>, and then let the jury give their verdict
                           according to their conscience. But this, in the

                           and behaved with great attention and propriety.
                           I read the

                           there came on a gale of wind truly tremendous.
                           The ship pitched and rolled every minute, as if she

                           embraced the opportunity of the window being
                           open, to whip itself through, and half filled the
                           after-cabin with water; and in half an hour more
                           a mountain of waves broke over the vessel, and
                           pouring itself through the sky-light, paid the same
                           compliment to the fore-cabin, with which it had
                           already honoured the after one. About for in the

                           and twelve on the following Thursday, I actually
                           brought up almost a thousand lines, with rhymes at
                           the end of them. Having nothing better to do at
                           present, I may as well copy them into this book. 
                           Composed with such speed, and under such circumstances,
                           I take it for granted that the verses
                           cannot be very good; but let them be ever so bad,
                           I defy any one to be more sick while reading them
                           than the

                           This strange story was found by me in an old
