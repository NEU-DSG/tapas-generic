                        <p id="d58070e209">OUR little Verivic has written this small book, and it is a great comfort to us all
                           to see it in print. It is something done—a triumph. The wisest man, they tell us,
                           says there is no end of this—vanity. We hope so.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d58070e212">The world keeps going over and over, and yet some of it does not "see itself as others
                           see it." This seems a pity. Who is there that would not be the better by knowing how
                           he looks in the eyes of others? To put a strong case, possibly even the "righteous"
                           might be benefited by knowing exactly how they and their opinions appear to the "wicked."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d58070e215">Books are other people's eyes to see ourselves and our pets with. Is it really wise
                           for the bad to 
                           <hi id="d58070e217" style="font-style: italic;"></hi>taboo the eyes of the good, or the reverse? It is abundantly done, nevertheless, between
                           different classes, both, of course, esteeming themselves pretty good.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d58070e220">Almost every one has opinions, more or less settled, in regard to our various social
                           and religious institutions, including the stage. Our Verivic has the peculiarity of
                           having seen the latter from many points of view, without ever hating been "behind
                           the scenes," of any of the others, and of proceeding, from first to last, on the very
                           unpopular assumption, that if there is any salt on earth that retains its savor, it
                           cannot and will not shrink from familiarity with anything that needs to be saved.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d58070e226">The adult theatre seems to Verivic to have unfortunately lost much of the pure and
                           natural spirit of the child's, by the tide of sanctimony setting upon it so strong
                           as to drive it even to doubt whether its result is innocent, while it is conscious
                           that its intention is. Hence, perhaps, out of contempt for the uncharitableness of
                           the onslaught, it indulges in language and manners most shocking to the nerves of
                           sanctimony, but which, when carefully weighed, will be found as unmeaning, if not
                           as void of profanity and wickedness, as some of the prayers and conventionalities
                           so highly valued outside. Unseemly excrescences were better avoided on both sides.
                           Granting the wickedness, if charity can cover a multitude of sins, might it not, and
                           had it not better, prevent them? Why not cherish and cultivate, the theatre, as so
                           much preserved childhood, useful, like occasional sleep, to reinvigorate the earnestness
                           of later life? This is Verivic's question.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d58070e229">If your own opinion of this peculiar institution, once fondly nurtured but long since
                           anathematized by the church, is not stereotyped or copper-faced, possibly you will
                           become, by a decree of your own private judgment, one of Verivic's readers. What a
                           precious confidence! For there is not the slightest probability that any Sunday school
                           committee, or Young Men's Christian Association committee, or any Dramatic Fund committee,
                           or even any Public Library committee, or the Œcumenical Council will authorize the
                           reading of this little book at present. The poor fledgeling will have to work its
                           own way in the wide world, or not go at all beyond being a blessing to the family
                           nest where it was hatched.

                              of uncommunicative aspect, obscured sometimes by dingy wooden shutters, and always
                              by dust. A large entrance, invitingly open, displayed walls with brightly painted
                              panels. Two black, giant-lettered posters, just outside, announced that more alluring
                              sights wore to be seen within. At one side, and down a narrow archway, where only
                              once a day a single sunbeam stole, could be found a door, that, in the pure light,
                              looked half ashamed, as if it had exhausted its spirits in the night's festivities,
                              and just awakened. It was notched and blotched, and with the paint washed off in streaks.

                              and swiftly, passing the black giant-lettered posters as if they dazzled her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e346">The building was the old Union Theatre, and the child was Abigail Hart. In the neighborhood
                              of the theatre was Abigail's home—a brick house, one of a block, that was unlike its
                              fellows only in having, a pleasanter face, for in a little iron-fenced bit of ground
                              before it—a very grave-yard lot in itself—had sprung a grape-vine, that year by year
                              reached out its delicate tendrils, and clung to the rough bricks, till in time it
                              became powerful, and with its strong branches embraced the wall that had given it
                              protection, and in grateful return held sunshine in its rich green foliage and purple
                              bunches, to keep young the soul of the old house, that at times it might forget the
                              weary care and noise of the great city, and dream a little of nodding tree-tops far
                              away, and cool babbling streams, that ran between green banks decked with the bright
                              blooms of wild flowers. The best bunches and greenest leaves of the vine clustered
                              about the highest windows of the building, those nearest to heaven and the angels,
                              and where daily seven eager rosy faces peered into the wide world. The room, warmed
                              thus with the vine's sunniest smiles, was called by the parents "the children's room."
                              The apartment extended from end to end of the old house, and was oddly furnished.
                              Its walls were papered with pictures, and a set of long shelves were covered with
                              books. Study books, story books, and fairy tales were alike there; for the rest there
                              were seven little desks, and as many little chairs, a piano, an easel, and a huge
                              box that was filled with toys. Flowers grew in large pots, and tame birds flew at
                              will among them, or lit on the pretty heads and hands of the children. A philosopher
                              had conceived the idea that to educate children, you had only to turn them loose into
                              a library, and an artist had modelled this bower with his own hands. When this philosopher
                              and artist combined had completed his work all but the soul, he opened the room to
                              his seven little children; and behold, it was no longer a thing without life. It was
                              no longer a room, but a very land of dreams. The careless, eager young feet went dancing
                              over the flowery paths opened for them into the wonderful world, through all the books
                              and pictures about them, and tasted such fruit as fed the first vague hankerings of
                              deeper passions yet in the germ. The children made of this bower a city in the imaginary
                              world in which they lived. The world was called the "made-up world," and the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="10-11"> </a></span> city, "Fosus." Each book was a house, wherein dwelt a family of paper dolls. These
                              were the common people of the world. It had also its aristocracy. The aristocracy
                              occupied the little desks; and ink bottles, papers, and pens found an abode where
                              they might be subservient to the wants of the 
                              <foreign id="d58070e350" xml:lang="FRA">élite</foreign>—an ink bottle doing nicely for a stove, and the paper being turned to account for
                              dresses. "The wild country" outside, known to grown folks as a store-room, grew old
                              boxes and bits of pasteboard, that were hewn down by the presiding geniuses of the
                              city, and manufactured into tables, chairs, and beds for the aristocracy. Each family
                              had its own home and name, each member its own peculiar voice, out of which it was
                              not allowed to speak, and in time its own history, for new events came with new days.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e355">There was in the largest desk a church, wherein weddings and funerals took place;
                              and in the largest flower-pot, under the oleander tree, was a burying-ground, covered
                              with little pasteboard tomb-stones, on each of which was inscribed a tiny epitaph.
                              A court-house occupied the window-seat. A theatre was built of the largest books,
                              and at night, so that the big lamp always used in the children's room, and christened
                              by them the "gloomer," on account of its doubtful effulgence, could stand behind a
                              bit of green glass, and emit a feeble green glimmer upon the stage. The families would
                              all flock out of their book and desk houses, and occupy the miniature benches placed
                              for them in the auditory. Gail owned the manager of this theatre, whose name was Monsieur
                              Belmont, and who talked broken English like the children's French dancing-master.
                              It was a gala night for the six others, when Gail would consent to play theatre, which
                              she did in this manner. The little theatre had its real orchestra, for the elder brother
                              William, to whom the piano belonged, possessed a subtile power, that hovered about
                              the ends of his lithe fingers, so that he had only to make passes over the keys of
                              the piano, and they would become mesmerized, and the air would be full of music.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e358">There were real actors also, who all spoke their parts in the voices of the big theatre
                              actors. Gail was the "unseen power" of the stage, while Jenny was the "genius" who
                              gave breath to the audience Gail would conceal herself behind the book structure,
                              and make her little puppets enter, by means of a thread attached to their waists—a
                              method often attended by difficulties not encouraging to he heart of manager Belmont,
                              who, being under the guidance of an unseen power, whose eyes were<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="7" data-tei-n="12-13"> </a></span> muffled by a shawl, often saw his Juliet enter on her head, and Romeo, when he should
                              have "taken the measure of an unmade grave," leap up like a harlequin, and make a
                              sudden exit through the top of the building.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e363">This climax would occasion so much breath to be given to the audience by the "genius"
                              in the act of laughing, as to cause them to disport themselves in a most unmannerly
                              way. The play could never be resumed till policeman Mander had ejected nearly the
                              entire crowd for disorderly conduct. Gail, who was very much in earnest about the
                              stage, did not enjoy this issue to her play nearly as well as her younger brother,
                              whose lungs gave a very rough voice to policeman Mander, and who occupied no small
                              time in marshalling the refractory individuals, one by one, off to his little station-house.
                              The sister preferred making actors of the presiding spirits, and an audience of Judy,
                              the stout servant girl, who did nicely to "sit and see." As Gail could not devise
                              a curtain to her extempore stage, the audience was respectfully requested by the management
                              to turn its back upon the preparations till such time as it should hear the prompter's
                              whistle.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e366">Gail always drew tears from her audience, but Judy's eyes were not critics.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e369">The children did not always live in their city. They took long rambles with their
                              father through woods and over hills, and listened to the wonderful things he read
                              to them from the open book of Nature, which, indeed, was a most exciting book to study
                              from, and one full of pictures. They played, too, on the Common, and on rare occasions
                              on the sidewalk. They mixed very little with the other children, and while they admired,
                              and made up histories, for each little one in the neighborhood, were shy and bashful
                              before them. It sometimes happened that they visited a real theatre. This was a great
                              event to them all, but to Abigail it was more. She drank there what fed the secret
                              fire in her soul, wile the rest listened, laughed, and were amused like children.
                              Abigail felt little shivers of enthusiasm run through her, and would picture strange
                              scenes before her, in which an ardent little being would rush upon the stage, and
                              plead to be admitted within the enchanted portals.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e372">O, how the bright lights and painted walls of the theatre, and all the gay faces,
                              took possession of her, while she sat alone in the great crowd, dreaming her wild
                              dreams! How, when the curtain fell in the last act, her heart would sink because it
                              was all over, and she would walk out in silence, while the rest chatted merrily over
                              the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="8" data-tei-n="14-15"> </a></span> play! On one night the curtain rose to reveal a new scene, far more beautiful than
                              the children had ever witnessed before. It was a fairy scene, and in it Gail beheld,
                              for the first time, "the fairy." When the music ceased, and the prompter's bell sounded,—a
                              time always of much excitement to the children,—the curtain rose on a picture that
                              made the fourteen wondering eyes open very wide. The stage was all glittering with
                              fleecy gold-tipped clouds, for it was the realm of the spirits of the air, and a circle
                              of fairy beings lined the centre of these clouds, gently stirring their native element
                              with long, silvery sticks, as if it was some ethereal pudding. In their midst stood
                              Germando, the fairy, by the extra brightness of her dress a trifle higher in the grades
                              of aerial aristocracy. Suddenly the children cried, "O!" and Gail's face grew paler
                              with the intensity of her emotion; for a huge, dazzling star slowly curled its points
                              inward, having taken fire, perhaps, from its own brightness, and a radiant queen stepped
                              forth: then the fairies all burst into a beautiful song, that rose like a sky-rocket,
                              and broke on some very high notes, in the words, "Behold our fai—ry queen." Gail felt
                              her little hands grow cold, and her lips tremble, the scene was so intensely exciting.
                              After the song, the fairy queen commanded silence, in a voice sufficiently unnatural
                              to belong to a fay, but a voice that thrilled Gail, it was so like the theatre and
                              the stage. The queen addressed herself to an enchanted prince and a comic mortal,
                              whom the children had not before observed in the superior splendor of the fairies.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e378">"Rash mortal, what wouldst thou in these enchanted realms?" said the queen. "Knowest
                              thou not that this is the domain of the spirits of the air?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e381">The prince thus supposed to have trespassed on aerial premises replied, "Will your
                              most transcendent majesty deign to award me the magic rose?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e384">"Thankless mortal," responded the queen, "behold, the magic rose is thine. Germando,
                              conduct him to the enchanted grotto, there to witness the midnight revels of our fays."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e387">"I obey, I obey!" shouted Germando, who had quite won the children's hearts by standing
                              with her feet in the second position, and her cheek pursed up on one side in a manner
                              most interesting, though a trifle suggestive of obliviousness of what had been passing.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e390">The comic mortal withdrew his eyes from a couple of revolving barber-poles that had
                              held him apparently inthralled, and that were, indeed, dazzling, to smile upon Germando,
                              and to say,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="16-17"> </a></span> "Charming Germando, please to conduct me too;" and the trio made an exit, the fairy
                              backing off the stage, and describing imaginary circles in an uncomfortable proximity
                              to the nose of the enchanted one.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e395">When, after all the bright intervening scenes, the green curtain finally shut out
                              this unearthly paradise from Gail's eyes, she gathered it up in her heart, drew a
                              long breath, and said to herself, vehemently, "I will be an actress." That night,
                              before Gail slept, she added to her customary child's devotions, a brief petition
                              of her own. "Dear Father in heaven, when I grow up, let me go on the stage, for Christ's
                              sake. Amen." Then she tossed about on her bed, somewhat feverishly, rehearsing and
                              planning the little scenes for her own mimic theatre. The next day beheld each sister
                              with her pinafore rolled up tightly about her waist, and tied behind, and the short
                              delaine skirts of her gown decorated with bits of gold paper. Jennie, being a slender
                              girl, was selected as a fairy queen, and, for lack of a star, was mounted on some
                              chairs, to peep over the top of a door. Gail represented the prince. The material
                              was inadequate at best; but when the homely fairies stood stirring the air with curtain
                              sticks, in short stuff dresses, among clouds that were only shawls, Gail touched the
                              scene with the magic of her love, and lo, there was upon it a golden glow, reflected
                              from her imagination.

                           <p id="d58070e399">Once the real fairy was signalled by little Esther Hart from the high window. There

                              of glass. It was true, there could be no mistaking the fairy's identity, for although
                              she was a little less rosy, and a little more freckled by daylight, Gail's heart was
                              thrilled by the sight of very pink stockings, and a portion of a fairy dress visible
                              beneath her cloak. After this the faces peered through the window daily in the hopes
                              of again beholding the happy child actress.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e402">The street was a place at any time of no little interest to the children; for in one
                              of the tall brick houses—called by them the "dungeon keep," because its blinds were
                              always closed, and the boldest child dared not play on its steps—lived the princess,
                              guarded by a wicked fairy godmother. The princess had "long curling hair," made of
                              fine threads of the purest gold, and a face that was exquisitely beautiful. None of
                              the children but Jenny had ever seen the princess "near to;" and when Jenny saw her,
                              her lovely eyes and nose were red with weeping for the death of a sweet<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="18-19"> </a></span> brown mouse. The children were sorry for the poor princess, who wept and was lonely;
                              but, nevertheless, they whispered mysteriously to one another that it would be a fine
                              thing to be an unhappy though lovely princess, and live with a wicked fairy in a dungeon
                              keep.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e407">Between the dungeon keep and the theatre was a terrible archway, running along the
                              blind walls of two huge old buildings, and terminating in doors situated in the rear
                              of these buildings. This place was termed the Bannock's den, and was inhabited by
                              a creature half man and half monster, whose domestic habits were eccentric, as were
                              his ideas of diet. Though a being of huge proportions, he was wont to withdraw into
                              a rat-hole by day, issuing forth only at night, for the fell purpose of dragging in
                              any stray child that might pass that way alone. Even a big man, the children thought,
                              would have to "run by after it was dark." Now that Gail had seen the fairy by daylight,
                              a new dream entered her head. It began to seem possible to her that she might one
                              day meet the fairy, and that, being in truth a child, like herself, the fairy might
                              speak to her, and being at the same time a fairy, might give her the "open, sesame"
                              to the mysterious stage door; for surely it lay in the power of a fairy to change
                              common people into actresses, if she had the mind.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e410">Perhaps with the faint hope of this happy issue Gail and her sisters ventured oftener
                              out into the street. They came, in time, even to establish a sort of platform on the
                              sidewalk, in the near vicinity of the theatre, and to instruct their new companions
                              in the art of acting.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e413">The little ones of the street were greatly pleased with this, as a game particularly
                              appropriate to the place, and likely to strike with amazement any passing actor or
                              actress. In truth there did come about the issue Gail so ardently desired; for one
                              day, as they were occupied with their little theatre, the fairy actually appeared,
                              radiant in a pink dress, a yellow gauze bonnet, and a spangled veil. In one hand she
                              held a pickled lime, from which she occasionally took a careless suck, thereby completing
                              her conquest of the children; for what could be more suggestive of worldly ease?
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e416">One of the little amateurs—a girl of a practical turn of mind, and the happy possessor
                              of an old broom—was at the time personating a woman sweeping. She rendered the part
                              in a fine shrill voice, and through her nose. Her little spectators had been much
                              excited and pleased with her performance; but at the arrival of the new-comer, the
                              corps fell back, and there ensued that period of silence which preludes children's
                              getting<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="20-21"> </a></span> acquainted. For the most part, the little novices, in calico frocks and pantalets
                              to match, bowed bashfully, before the "real play-actress." They did not share Gail's
                              worship of her, but still felt much awe on account of her bright, fine dress. One
                              only among them, an unpoetical little girl, murmured to herself, with some defiance,
                              "I hope you see." The others did not heed her. The silence continued, and was again
                              broken by the most bashful of the party, who found it easier to speak to the stranger
                              through one of her own companions than directly to address her. "I guess she didn't
                              think much of Annie's making believe, she seen so much better herself, and her a real
                              play-actress." The other children joined the little speaker, each in her own way apologizing
                              for Annie's acting. Annie herself only opposed the current with a few pouts, and then
                              subsided, giving place to the stronger, attraction. Suddenly a clear, sweet voice
                              broke out from among them, addressing the fairy herself. "We were playing theatre,"
                              said the voice; "would you like to join us? Annie here was just acting beautifully,
                              I think," It was Jennie Hart who spoke, and she spoke with kindness, but with some
                              decision. There is a magic in a leading mind which tempts human beings to follow.
                              The children at once caught Jennie's spirit. It was agreed that they should resume
                              the play of theatre, as being the most appropriate in the presence of a real actress.
                              "Now, Annie," said Jennie Hart, "we are all ready to sit and see; so go on with your
                              part."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e422">"I daresn't?" responded Annie, promptly. The little girls each began to tease Annie;
                              but the child blushed and hung back. "Well, then," said Jennie, herself a little bashful,
                              "perhaps Ardel will show us what real acting is." The children of the street glanced
                              at one another, for it was current among them that Ardel's real name was Bridget Smith.
                              "I should hope," replied Ardel, "that I had enough of that before the footlights."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e425">The children were silent at this, for it seemed to imply that what was cake to them
                              was every-day food to Ardel.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e428">"Do you know the 'Lady of Lyons'?" inquired Ardel, with a condescending smile.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e431">"I don't, but my mother does," said Hattie Smith, not to be outdone.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e434">"I guess we are too big for that," put in the youngest of the party, in whose mind
                              was flitting infantile memories of a game called "Lions and Bears," best played around
                              the legs of a table.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e437">"I could perform 'The Lady of Lyons,'" hinted Ardel.</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="22-23"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e443">"O, do, if you can," responded the other children.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e446">After some giggling, and one or two false starts, the real actress commenced the real
                              play.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e449">Gail had taken no part in the scene, for the reason that she was the most interested.
                              Her interest made her timid before the being she would confide in. And now, while
                              Ardel played, Gail's heart beat fast with the thought that the play would soon end,
                              and she must speak or lose her chance. Ardel turned to her unexpectedly, and said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e452">"Here, you take me into your house, and show me your dresses and picture books."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e455">Gail accepted the proposal with a tremor of delight. The girls had walked but a few
                              steps, however, when a loud, somewhat harsh voice called to Ardel to come into the
                              house, and a pair of blinds shut, with a slam, over a retreating face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e459">"'Tis me mother," said Ardel; "you come in with me;" and Gail felt herself drawn into
                              the doorway of a wooden building from whence the voice had proceeded.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e462">The room the children had entered was far from clean, or orderly in appearance. The
                              chairs were occupied by tinsel coats, peasant dresses, and costumes of various kinds.
                              On the bureau appeared the evidences of a recent feast; sundry dishes, fragments of
                              food, and cigar stumps seemed quite at home in the company of the more legitimate
                              articles of rouge, powder, and a hair-brush. The bed was unmade, and the receptacle
                              of a pile of programmes, a tambourine, and some slippers. On the footboard was nailed
                              a string of false curls, and a pair of stockings newly pinked. The clutter gave the
                              room a noisy effect, although no one had spoken. The dress of Ardel's mother was like
                              everything else, at loose ends. She was engaged in fastening some of the most rebellious
                              rips and tears, preparatory to going out. On perceiving her daughter, she cried,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e465">"You're a nice girl, to go off and leave me with everything on my 'ands! You've no
                              dress picked out for to-night, and we're both on in the first scene. Now come, no
                              words about it; but get things ready for to-night; and you might pick out something
                              for me." The tone was not ill-natured, though it was both loud and harsh. "'Ow do
                              you do, my dear?" she continued, observing Gail. "Would you mind taking 'old and helping
                              Del a bit? And may be one of these days I'd get Jimmy Tucker to pass you round in
                              front." During this speech a man in shirt sleeves, with a cigar<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="13" data-tei-n="24-25"> </a></span> in his mouth, had come in, and stood surveying the party silently. "Who are you?"
                              cried the lady to this new-comer. "I don't know you: go home."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e470">The man, without heeding this bantering remark, responded,—</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e473">"On in the last act again—deuce! Want to see how Harry gets along at the Ash Street,
                              and can't."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e476">"Well, mind you," said Ardel's mother, soothingly, "we'ave to take things as they
                              come in this world; may be you'd get Thursday; the bill's not up."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e480">The man gave a significant whistle, as much as to say, "Catch them leaving the attraction
                              out of the programme," and strolled off.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e483">Mrs. Sands, who had by this time tied on a dirty bonnet, and whisked over it a dirtier
                              veil to conceal it, went out also.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e486">The girls being left alone, Gail confided to Del her aspirations, and Ardel patronized
                              her with a pitying toleration. When they parted, however, Gail had obtained from the
                              little actress the promise she desired.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e489">After this a great many days passed, and among them the day Del had selected to take
                              her new friend behind the scenes. It was not until hope had given place to suspense,
                              and suspense to despair, that the child again saw the fairy. They met on the street.
                              Del was accompanied by no less a luminary than the comic mortal, who by daylight had
                              all the serious aspect to be imparted by hair oiled and curled in a large number of
                              small rings, and a hat worn, with set carelessness, on one side. Gail's face flushed,
                              half in pride and half in diffidence; she waited for Ardel to bow first. Del, however,
                              only raised her eyebrows, and talked very familiarly to her companion, enjoying the
                              effect such a happy conjunction of stars must produce on any one so moon-struck as
                              to aspire to be a planet also. The little recluse, educated in no real-world school,
                              drew back at this, sensitively, and wept with an odd mixture of anger and sorrow.
                              The sudden dethroning of an ideal her heart had held sacred gave her acute pain; and
                              yet the rough touch of the fairy did not disenchant her with the fairy world.

                           <p id="d58070e503">JULIE WARD was the princess, and the dungeon keep was the place Julie called home.
                              Outside of the dungeon and along the street the princess sometimes sang softly to
                              herself, for she was by nature a merry princess; but she always stopped at the prison
                              gate, as though there had been a funeral inside, and stole in noiselessly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e506">The princess was afraid of the wicked fairy god-mother, who appeared to her in the
                              disguise of a step-mother. This step-mother was a woman angular in body and in soul
                              also, a relic of the old barbarous style of religion that had been well preserved
                              in the family, and handed down to the present day—the very imbodiment of all that
                              is unforgiving, cruel, and narrow in the age when a person was hanged for being so
                              unfortunate as to have the reputation of being possessed by a devil. Such a soul may
                              have few human sins, but plenty of inhuman. If her hard nature could have hugged anything,
                              it would have been the motto, "Spare the rod and spoil the child;" as it was, it clutched
                              it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e510">When Julie, with the natural elastic spirit of childhood, recovered from the sorrow
                              of her father's death, the hungry little heart began to look about for something to
                              love and to be happy in, and, finding a stone offered to her instead of bread, began,
                              with babyish arts, to try to draw from it the fluid appropriate to her age; but the
                              system of stern repulses and blows that met these advances, and punished each careless
                              thought and act, so soon alienated the child from the mother, that Mrs. Ward lost
                              the confidence of the little one, and knew nothing of the nature and needs of the
                              soul intrusted to her care. It was enough, however, for one so narrow, to see that
                              the child feared her, and was obedient.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e513">The little Julie was not happy, neither was she very unhappy, for it is as hard to
                              chain the spirit of a child as to catch and hold a little ball of quicksilver between
                              your thumb and finger; and while the step-mother held Julie's body in a servile fear,
                              the spirit contrived to elude her, and steal its sustenance from forbidden fruit.
                              It is true, out of school, the child's life was a dull round of work and prayer-meetings,
                              and she could count her recreations on her two first fingers; still she enjoyed<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="28-29"> </a></span> joyed these two recreations with a childish zest. She called them her "good ones."
                              Her first "good one" was a mouse. She had found the little fellow struggling to free
                              himself from a trap, and had released him with eager haste, and bore him, quaking,
                              up to her lonely little room, herself trembling not less than the mouse. She made
                              for him a box house, and concealed it beneath her bed. She talked to the mouse, and
                              found it less dull than thinking all by herself. Her second "good one" was the Sunday
                              school. Julie liked the Sunday school, because she could wear her best bonnet, and
                              because she felt sure she should have fallen in love with Jesus, "he was so good and
                              so interesting;" and then at the Sunday school the children all exchanged their real
                              sympathies in the dumb language of the little animals and the flowers, that the superintendent
                              and the teachers could not understand. One Sunday Julie came home from school with
                              fresh color in her pretty face. She straightway knelt down before the mouse to make
                              confession. "Look up, mouse," she whispered. "I have got a third; yes, mouse, and
                              it's the most depraved of all. It's—a—wicked—little—lover." Julie made her voice still
                              lower at the word "lover," and blushed. "His sinful name is Frederic Augustus Somerby.
                              He has lent me a book, mouse, that is not fitted for the minds of the young. Isn't
                              it nice? He slipped it into my hand, and said it was a funny book, all about hobgoblins.
                              To say the truth, mouse, I've met him once or twice before. We met by chance the usual
                              way, which, mouse, is not in the way of the Lord, and, therefore, not in the way of
                              step-mamma. It is all very nice, but it is not for the eternal welfare of my soul;
                              but I'm afraid I don't care for the eternal. Amen, mouse."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e518">A certain man visited Julie's step-mother, for whom the child had conceived an antipathy.
                              She called him the "Presiding Elder," because she had once heard the term from his
                              mouth, and it pleased her fancy. Whenever she talked of the presiding elder to the
                              mouse, she drew very near the cage, and put on a very sober manner. "I don't like
                              him a 
                              <emph id="d58070e520">bit,</emph> mouse. He talks like dull books, and he can think of nothing to say except about
                              rods, and such things, which, to people like you and me, mouse, the unelect, is personal,
                              and makes us feel ashamed, whether or no. His heart is hardened, too, and it ought
                              not to be, for he is very fat. He has got horrid little eyes, that keep saying disagreeable
                              things, and making people blush when he isn't speaking at all; and, O, mouse, if he
                              was to 
                              <emph id="d58070e523">touch</emph> you, he'd make you shiver all over, his hands<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="16" data-tei-n="30-31"> </a></span> are so damp and sticky; and then he is acquainted with seven devils, which I consider
                              bad company; but 
                              <emph id="d58070e528">then,</emph> he's not given over to the vanities of this world, because he has nothing to be vain
                              about; neither have any of us, mouse: we brought nothing into this world, and we shall
                              take nothing away; which is quite true of me and you, for we have got nothing to take
                              away; but don't you be a vain mouse, because you are not even a white mouse, but just
                              one of those common brown mice that are only 
                              <emph id="d58070e531">pests.</emph> The old cat will catch you one of these days, if you don't look out sharp."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e535">It sometimes happened that Mrs. Ward and the elder found it for Julie's moral welfare
                              to attend prayer-meetings without her. On these happy occasions Julie would make believe
                              her one stiff little chair was a rocking-chair, and move herself back and forth, while
                              she sang, as loud as she pleased, to a bit of wood tied up in a shawl. One night,
                              as Julie rocked and sang, Fred came and stood under her window, and whistled very
                              low. Julie, true to her coquettish instinct, pretended she did not hear, and went
                              on with her song; but the singing had a shy zest it did not possess before. Fred,
                              however, was not to be baffled. He called the name in a whisper, but distinctly. Julie
                              pinched the wooden baby to keep herself from laughing, and made him repeat the name
                              once or twice more. Then she peeped out of the window. "Go away, you bad boy," she
                              whispered. "Don't you know what will happen if you come so near? I told you always
                              to stop and whistle at No. 20."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e538">"I know it, Julie," answered Fred, with much excitement. "We should both catch it
                              if we were found out; but we won't be. 
                              <emph id="d58070e540">She's</emph> gone away, and I want you to come and go to the theatre with me. It's awful jolly
                              there. Come quick. You needn't open the front door; you can climb down on the trellis,
                              and I'll catch you if you fall."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e544">Julie's heart began to beat quite fast; but she drew her mouth down, and answered
                              soberly, "You won't catch me climbing down at all, Fred. I should break my neck."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e548">"No, you wouldn't," said Fred. "O, do be quick, or folks will see you, and tell. Your
                              can climb up again at night, and nobody will know you've been gone."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e551">"Lead us not into temptation," said Julie, solemnly. "For of such is the kingdom of
                              Heaven. Fred, I will not go."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e554">"O, bother, Jule! I didn't think you'd go back on a fellow," said Fred, half crying.
                              "The play will begin, and we shall lose the best part, and all because you will act
                              so plaguy silly."

                           <p id="d58070e559">"What do they do in theatres, Fred?" whispered Julie, with mysterious awe. "I suppose
                              it's a very wicked place; 'the presiding' says so, and he is a very godly man, you
                              know."

                           <p id="d58070e562">"I dare say he knows," answered Fred, with sarcasm. "He's been there often enough,
                              I'll be bound. It's a very jolly place, Julie, and just as good as their old churches
                              are. They have dancing there, and a fellow sings a song that's enough to make you
                              die a laughing."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e566">"But I'm not prepared to die, Fred," said Julie, again, with solemnity.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e569">"And there's an elopement, and a duel with swords, and in the third act a murder,
                              and everything nice," continued Fred, reproachfully, as his mind pictured these charms
                              in the act of passing away.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e572">"But, Fred, I'm tied at home with the cares of a family," remarked Julie, demurely.
                              "If you will not fix your mind on death and judgment, consider the mouse."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e575">"O, the mouse," said Fred, impatiently; "well, darn him! I mean give him a great hunk
                              of cheese, and come along. I never saw such a thing. What's the matter with you? I
                              should like to know."

                           <p id="d58070e578">"Fred, I am only thinking of Christ and holier things; that's the matter with me,"
                              said Julie, smiling secretly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e581">"What a tease you are, Jule! I think you ought not to act like that towards me. If
                              you don't come down quick, I shall come up and pull you down."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e585">"Then I shall scream," said Julie.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e588">"Then I won't," responded Fred, quickly. "I wouldn't care if I was caught; nobody'd
                              hurt me, but they would you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e591">There was a pause. Fred hacked the trellis impatiently with his knife, until Julie
                              again peeped out of the window, and whispered softly,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e594">"Fred, have you gone away?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e597">"No," said Fred, crossly; "but I'm going."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e600">"Because," continued Julie, "I feel as if I was coming down. Yes, I feel as if I was
                              going to put on my best bonnet, and descend; so you go off somewhere, and look at
                              something, while I climb down."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e604">Fred obeyed with alacrity, and stood facing the yard fence, dancing an impatient little
                              hornpipe, while Julie made a ladder of the trellis, and then ran to him, with two
                              bright spots burning in either cheek, and an excited light in her beautiful eyes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e607">"O, my eye, what a pretty girl you are!" said<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="34-35"> </a></span> the boy-lover, turning around smartly. "You are the very prettiest girl in the whole
                              world."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e612">"It's the bonnet," said Julie, slyly. "It 
                              <emph id="d58070e614">is</emph> a love. I found the flowers myself, and pinned them in. 
                              <emph id="d58070e617">She</emph> would never let me have any."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e621">"It isn't the bonnet, either," answered Fred, scornfully. "
                              <emph id="d58070e623">Other</emph> girls have prettier bonnets, and prettier dresses, too, but they haven't 
                              <emph id="d58070e626">near</emph> such pretty faces. It's 
                              <emph id="d58070e629">you,</emph> Julie; and if I was you, Julie, I'd chuck the bonnet off, when we get there; you've
                              got long curls, and you look better without it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e633">When they had got beyond hearing, Julie sniffed the fresh air, and was ready to jump
                              for joy. "O, Fred, isn't it nice?" she said. "I feel so light and free. Let's hop-skip
                              the rest of the way."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e636">"No, don't let's," said Fred; "people would look."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e640">"I know it's dreadful wicked to go, besides being sinful," said Julie, gleefully;
                              "and the theatre is a dreadful wicked place; but I guess I like wicked things and
                              wicked people best. Do you know, Fred," added Julie, slackening her pace, and turning
                              suddenly sober, "I sometimes think when I die I'd rather go to—you know—the wicked
                              place—than, to heaven, because—perhaps you never heard it mentioned, but father died
                              with an 
                              <emph id="d58070e642">unrepentant</emph> heart, and 
                              <emph id="d58070e645">he</emph> has gone there; and if he's there, I'd rather be there too; besides, Fred, 
                              <emph id="d58070e648">you</emph> are going there, too, when you die, and so is everybody that's pleasant."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e652">"Thank you," said Fred; "but I don't believe I'll ask old Unctious"—this was Fred's
                              name for the presiding elder—"where I shall go to when I die; besides, the theatre
                              ain't a wicked place, no more'n he is. 
                              <emph id="d58070e654">Father</emph> goes there, and he's good."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e658">"Is your father one of the elect, think?" said Julie.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e661">"No; I should hope not," answered Fred, indignantly. "He's something a great deal
                              jollier. He knows how to do a good thing, and not blow about it forever."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e664">"But you know, Fred," answered Julie, shaking her head, "it availeth not a man that
                              he shall do good if he have not faith in the word."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e667">"That's the way they always fetch us up," said Fred; "just as if 
                              <emph id="d58070e669">their</emph> word was the word. Father says, the word of God is a great deal too great to be contained
                              in only one book. It is written in—in all nature, you know, and in the brains and
                              hearts of all people, and that—And I guess he knows."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="36-37"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e676">Julie shook her head.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e679">"When we grow up," continued Fred, beginning to talk very fast, "I'm going to marry
                              you; then she shan't call everything pleasant wicked, and take it away from you. You
                              shall have a good time, and pretty things to wear on, like other people."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e682">"But, Fred," said Julie, archly, "perhaps I shan't fall in love with you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e685">"O, but you will, Julie," said Fred, hastily, and blushing with confusion, "because
                              it would be so plaguy mean if you didn't. I never shall love any other girl but you.
                              Then we are just the right age—you are eleven and I am twelve."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e688">"We are too old, I'm afraid," said Julie, mischievously.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e692">"You know what I mean," replied Fred; "what do you want to pester a fellow for? I
                              mean you will be sixteen when I am seventeen, and that will be just right."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e695">"O, hush!" said Julie. They had reached the theatre; the color in Julie's cheeks deepened,
                              and she held her breath, the lights in the long entrance were so bright, and the people
                              were dressed so gay and fine. It was so wicked, but O, so terribly fascinating! Julie
                              held Fred's hand tightly, and walked on tiptoe up the aisle, as they entered the auditory.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e698">"You needn't be so 
                              <emph id="d58070e700">very</emph> still," whispered Fred; "it isn't a meeting-house."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e704">"I fear it is not," answered Julie, under her breath, bewildered and scared. "O, Fred,
                              perhaps we had better go home before it is too late."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e707">"Pshaw! Julie said Fred; "what a silly girl you are!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e710">Julie ventured to steal a look about the place; it was like the prince's palace in
                              Fred's story book; the walls were all decorated with gold paper, and there was a great
                              chandelier, as grand as any king would want, hanging in the centre. When she and Fred
                              took their seats, the ladies about them glanced at her, and then at each other, and
                              Julie heard one of them say, "What a lovely child! I wonder who she is. I never saw
                              so sweet a face before." Then there was music. Julie had never heard anything but
                              an organ and a hand-organ; but this music made her feel like laughing and crying at
                              the same moment, and seemed to be telling her all manner of charming things, and showing
                              her all manner of bright, beautiful places, till all at once the music changed to
                              a quick, lively air, and Julie touched Fred's shoulder, and pointed to the stage;
                              for something like a dark wall began to rise swiftly, and there were children all
                              dressed in white and gold, with garlands of flowers, who danced so<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="20" data-tei-n="38-39"> </a></span> beautifully, that, with the music dancing in her ears, she longed to spring upon
                              the stage, and join them. Julie had never had a white dress, and the angels in shining
                              robes could not be more beautiful than were these children. Then came a play that
                              was better than a story. It was more real; life was not dull and long; the people
                              grew up and got married in only a little while; they did not wear homely dresses;
                              they talked and laughed; for this was not the tragedy Fred had seen, but a comedy.
                              They danced together, and made love, and there was nobody to say it was wicked. Julie
                              forgot she was in a theatre, and all about how she had run away from home, and sat
                              with eyes wide open till the act drop fell and was ready to rise again, when she would
                              whisper to Fred, "O, look quick; it is coming up again." But at last the green curtain
                              fell, and the play was over; the lights were put down, and every one rose to go. Julie
                              heaved a deep sigh, and she and Fred walked out in silence, with hearts too full to
                              speak. Once in the street, however, Fred found his voice, and said, "Well, Julie,
                              wasn't it nice?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e716">"O, Fred!" sighed Julie, and was again silent.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e719">"Didn't I tell you that comic fellow would make you laugh?" said Fred, triumphantly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e722">"Yes, Fred," replied Julie; "but what I liked most was those beautiful children that
                              danced. I can shut up my eyes, and see them now."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e725">"
                              <emph id="d58070e727">Those</emph> wasn't children," said Fred, with emphasis. "How green you are, Julie! they were
                              big people."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e731">"They wasn't," said Julie. "How small they looked!"—"Didn't you think that was nice,
                              that scene in the woods, where 
                              <emph id="d58070e733">he</emph> comes in with a lantern?" Fred began; but Julie stopped him suddenly, and turned
                              very white.—"O, Fred, see there; it's the 'presiding elder;' it really is."—"Where?"
                              said Fred, becoming suddenly red.—"There," whispered Julie, not daring to look around,
                              "not far behind us, near the theatre."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e737">"Well, then, he's been there himself," said Fred, defiantly. "So 
                              <emph id="d58070e739">he</emph> can't say anything."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e744">"Yes, he can," said Julie, her teeth chattering. "You don't know him; he can say that
                              he was there to report the wickedness thereof. You know he can, and he will too, and
                              he'll tell about us," added Julie, wringing her hands, and beginning to cry faintly.
                              "O, I wish we hadn't come at all."—"If he does, I'll punch his head," said Fred between
                              his teeth; "but perhaps he didn't see us," he continued, glancing around. "He seems
                              to be going in another way; so come along, Julie, and don't cry."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e747">The children ran on breathlessly a few paces,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="40-41"> </a></span> and then Fred said, "Pshaw! Julie; what a girl you are to take a scare! I don't believe
                              it was him at all." Julie made no answer, and the children hastened on until they
                              reached the head of the street on which Julie lived.—"Now I'll go the rest of the
                              way alone," whispered Julie. "I can make less noise so."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e752">"No, you shan't," answered Fred, "somebody will run away "with you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e755">"No, they won't," replied Julie, with emphatic earnestness; "you mustn't go. I don't
                              want to have people disturbed, and a great row made, because I want to go to sleep,
                              and see if I can't dream it all over again, it would be so nice! Do you know, Fred,
                              I am always glad when night comes—to dream, you know. So you let me run alone, and
                              I'll watch my chance, and steal in just as soft as my mouse. O, Fred," added Julie;
                              and she heaved another sigh.—"Well, Julie," said Fred, tenderly; but Julie was silent.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e758">"O," said Fred, "I thought you was going to say something about me." Julie's eyes
                              were fixed on the stars and the distance, and Fred saw that there were tears in them.
                              "Pshaw! Julie, what are you thinking about?" continued he—"death and judgment, and
                              such things."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e761">"I was just thinking," answered Julie, "that I wish it wasn't wicked to go there;
                              for do you know, Fred, it makes me love God so much better, and feel so sorry for
                              all the unkind things I've thought about him, and sometimes even about poor Jesus,"
                              added Julie, in a low voice; "and that was so wrong; because you know 
                              <emph id="d58070e763">he</emph> said that about 'suffer little children.' Good night, Fred."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e768">"Good night, Julie," said Fred; "I'll look after you till you are out of sight."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e771">The boy stood watching the little fluttering figure till it was lost in the darkness,
                              and turned away. Julie ran along, in truth very much scared to be alone in the great
                              dark streets at night. Suddenly she stopped, and thought of the "Bannock's den," which
                              she must pass. Julie was familiar with the legend of the "Bannock," and the place
                              itself was repulsive enough in appearance, stained as it was, and blackened with grease,
                              littered with old bones and refuse, matter, the plank flooring rotten and gnawed away
                              by rats. Julie's heart stopped beating for very fear, but there was no help for it.
                              She summoned up her resolution, instinctively closed her eyes, and prepared to run
                              by, when something moved stealthily out of the old archway. Julie felt two damp hands
                              laid heavily over her mouth. She grew cold and numb with terror, and gave one frightened
                              glance behind<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="22" data-tei-n="42-43"> </a></span> her. What she saw was not the fiery eyes of the "Bannock," but the fat, repulsive
                              face, and the small browless eyes of the "presiding elder." If the look she saw in
                              the face had meant blows, Julie would have been less terrified; but, child as she
                              was, she instinctively felt the more devilish purpose in the mean leer of the brute.
                              She made an effort to struggle, but she could not move; she was paralyzed with fright.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e776">"Sweet little blossom! Sweet little fluttering bird!" murmured the dastard, huskily,
                              as he pressed his fat hand yet more closely over the child's mouth, and began with
                              a show of abstraction to draw her under the archway. Julie, frightened to desperation,
                              forced the hand a little from her mouth, and uttered a faint cry. Then came to her
                              senses what seemed a little flash of light, and the sound of footsteps. The coward,
                              alarmed, released her, and slunk into the den. More dead than alive, Julie forced
                              her numb limbs to move, and ran along the street blindly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e779">The alarm had been, false, for presently she heard steps pursuing her, that she knew
                              but too well. This gave her strength to quicken her pace. She reached the door; it
                              was locked. She sank down on the steps with a pitiful cry. There was a light inside
                              that moved along the entry. Julie knocked with all her strength. The "presiding elder"
                              reached the steps the same moment that Mrs. Ward opened the door. If she had been
                              an angel, with a sceptre of peace in her hand, instead of a harsh woman with a rod,
                              she could not have been more welcome to the frightened child. Julie stole past her;
                              and now that the danger was over, the poor child found herself sobbing and crying
                              violently, she knew not why.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e782">"What is it, brother Mesher?" said Mrs. Ward, knitting her brow sternly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e785">"Verily," returned brother Mesher, whose face was somewhat paler than usual, and whose
                              hand shook a little, "the sinful flee when none pursue. The spirit of the evil one
                              must have entered the guileless heart of the young sister, and tempted her into the
                              path of vanity, for she has this night visited the very nest of all vanities—the theatre.
                              I thought, at first, knowing your righteous and just views of the like iniquitous
                              places, that my eyes had deceived me; but, stopping the young damsel, I found it but
                              too true. The sinful heart quaketh," added brother Mesher, closing his eyes and smacking
                              his lips with a relish. "But spare not the rod, sister Ward, for who spareth the flesh
                              destroyeth the soul."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e789">"I know my duty, brother Mesher, and shall do<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="44-45"> </a></span> it. I am obliged to you," returned Mrs. Ward, with a dark, hard look in her face,
                              that the orphan girl knew but too well.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e794">Brother Mesher took his departure, and Julie turned pale in the appalling silence
                              that followed for a moment. She dared not reveal her adventure with the hypocrite.
                              The purity of the child shrank with a mixture of terror and shame from even the thought
                              of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e797">Mrs. Ward was a woman of few words. She did not question and argue with Julie, neither
                              did Julie beg and promise, as another child might; even her instincts bowed to her
                              inexorable fate. She trembled, clasped her hands, and prayed for strength.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e800">Mrs. Ward beat her without mercy; and when the child stood before her, white and breathless
                              with fear and pain, she said, coldly, "If you offend again, you shall be punished
                              more severely."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e803">When poor Julie lay awake in her lonely little room, she no longer cried, either with
                              the pain or the shame, for there was something in her heart new to it, something very
                              like hate for her step-mother.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e806">She lay quite still and clutched the bed-clothes, while her angry thoughts pressed
                              themselves through her brain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e810">"I will run away, some day, and live among those happy people. If she didn't strike
                              me, I'd stay; but as it is, I won't—I 
                              <emph id="d58070e812">won't.</emph> I love Satan better than God; he's a great deal kinder to people in this world. O,
                              I wish I was dead!" And Julie pounded the pillow for emphasis. "I wish she'd killed
                              me—that would have been good. I wonder how 
                              <emph id="d58070e815">she</emph> would like it, if a great giant came along, and took away the meeting-house and everything
                              she thought was nice. I wish one would, and would fling the 'presiding elder' clear
                              off, where nobody would ever find him."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e819">When Julie thought of the "presiding elder" she shuddered, and the step-mother seemed
                              far less detestable. "O, O, O! if, when they were so 
                              <emph id="d58070e821">cruel</emph> to me to-night, some angel had come down out of heaven, and took me away from them,
                              they would have been sorry, I guess."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e825">Julie's pride gave way, and she began to sob and cry with so much violence that she
                              frightened herself. She strove in vain to be quiet, and to sleep; but the little body
                              tossed restlessly about the bed, and the golden hair mussed itself in her tears, and
                              made poor Julie yet more uncomfortable, till at last—she hardly knew when—the feverish
                              thoughts changed to bad dreams. She seemed to get up, and with her bare feet and night-gown
                              glide softly<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="24" data-tei-n="46-47"> </a></span> down stairs, and out into the street! O, how deathly still the street was! How each
                              great house seemed a tomb, wherein sleep mocked death! How the air was peopled with
                              noiseless, fluttering phantoms! And as she moved along, not walking, but still gliding,
                              something crawled out of a by-place, and looked at her with a white face, showed its
                              teeth, and snarled. The face seemed neither human nor that of a brute. Its body was
                              huge, and shaped like a rat. Julie dared not move her eyes from the face, and there
                              came into it the same look she had seen in the "presiding elder's." Again she could
                              not scream. The creature reached out its claws to clutch her. She sank down with a
                              weak, trembling shock, and the darkness gathered about her. She opened her eyes. She
                              was in her own room; but there, before her bed, was still the face. The cold perspiration
                              stood on her forehead, and her eyes remained fixed. The face faded, and still Julie
                              lay for some moments unable to move, for the air about her seemed filled with other
                              horrors, and she dared not look around. She hid her face at last in the bed-clothes,
                              trembling and exhausted. The quivering lips repeated the child's prayer she had been
                              taught to say, for it came into this poor little head, tortured by church fairy tales,
                              what if hell should be like her dream! "I will be good," thought Julie. "I'll never
                              go there again, and I'll never make fun to my mouse." In her fear she almost resolved
                              to call her step-mother, but the choice of evils was not great; so she contented herself
                              by feeling about for the mouse-box, and drawing it into her bed, that she might have
                              some living thing near her. She tried not to sleep, lest she should again see the
                              face; and while she fancied she was still lying with her hand on the mouse-box, the
                              beautiful dancers came trooping into the room, and wafted her away to where there
                              was green grass, shaded by tall trees, and where she danced with the dancers in and
                              out among the trunks of the trees, until the sun stole in under the shadows and touched
                              her eyes, and Julie opened them to find the real sun shining into her room.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e830">With the pleasant dream and the daylight the ugly phantoms took their flight, and
                              left her natural again. She peeped into the mouse-box, cried, "Boo, mouse!" loud and
                              sudden, that she might startle her little pet from his slumbers, and see him scramble
                              about the box in his efforts to run away. When she had effected this end, and the
                              mouse sat blinking and trembling in the farther side of his box, Julie laughed, and
                              said, "Wake up, mouse, and say you are glad to see it's a pleasant<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="25" data-tei-n="48-49"> </a></span> day." But she made no confession to the mouse; she ran to the window instead, and
                              looked out. There was the street looking quite natural by daylight; and it came quite
                              natural to wonder if Fred would ever come again, and take her to the theatre. She
                              looked back into the room and sighed. The room was so dull! and the prayer-meeting
                              would seem duller than ever, and even the school would be dull by comparison. She
                              dreaded more than ever, to descend into the dark dining-room, and sit under the stony
                              gaze of her step-mother. But the day must be gone through with, and other days like
                              it must follow, and Julie could only sigh and wish.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e835">So many days, dull and alike, followed, with no Fred, that Julie's poor little brain
                              ached with wishing. Even the mouse was not satisfactory. She sighed to him each day,
                              "O, mouse, you are So dull! You are not even so lively as you used to be. What have
                              you done, mouse? Have you joined the church, and become a church mouse? You are worse
                              company than Fred; and I wouldn't be that, because Fred is only a young man, while
                              you are a fine gay mouse, with sharp, diamond eyes; think of that, mouse." But on
                              one of the days Julie forgot Fred and the theatre for the mouse. Peeping into his
                              little house, she found his poor little body all limp and shrunken, and his sharp
                              eyes blurred, quite cold, and dead. The child burst into tears of real grief. The
                              little creature had been almost the only thing her loving heart had had to caress.
                              She stole down into the street to wait till Fred should pass, on his way from school.
                              Fred took lessons of a private teacher, and Julie's school hours were always over
                              first.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e838">While she stood wringing her little hands in distress, Jennie Hart came by. It made
                              Jennie sad to see the princess in tears; and though Jennie was a little bashful before
                              princesses, she stopped, and inquired kindly if she could be of any service; but the
                              princess only cried harder. "Can't I?" said Jennie; "I should like to."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e842">"O, O," cried the princess, "something dreadful has happened; a dear, cunning little
                              mouse, that I loved, is dead," and the princess burst into fresh sobs.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e845">"O, it's too bad," said Jennie. "I know what it is to lose a mouse; because we lost
                              a dear little bird once. Should you like to bury your mouse?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e848">"O, my mouse! my poor mouse!" sobbed the princess; "and now he's dead!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e851">"Who's dead?" said Fred, coming up; "the 'presiding'? Good!"</p>

                           <p id="d58070e856">"O, no; my poor mouse."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e860">"Pshaw, Julie!" responded Fred, in a very different tone. "Cat get him? Cracky! Don't
                              cry though! I'll give you my marbles instead; or stay—I'll catch you another mouse.
                              Our house is overrun with them. We'd just as lieve you'd have one as not. In fact
                              we wouldn't mind sparing two."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e863">"But I don't want another mouse," said Julie. "No mouse could ever be to me what he
                              was. O, now I think of it, I remember how he got out of his box once, and gnawed a
                              hole in my slipper," sobbed Julie, overcome by this tender memory. "I 
                              <emph id="d58070e865">should</emph> like to bury him," she added, turning to Jennie.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e869">"Yes, let's bury him," said Fred; "that will be jolly. O, no; I don't mean that; I
                              mean it will be consoling."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e872">"I'll run home and bring Kaycander," said Jennie. "He officiates at funerals, and
                              is very happy on such occasions."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e875">"He ought to be very unhappy, 
                              <emph id="d58070e877">I</emph> should think," said Fred, looking at Julie, and blushing slightly, for Jennie was
                              a stranger to him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e881">Jennie laughed, and ran off on her errand, while Fred whispered to Julie, "I'll be
                              the grave-digger, and we'll have the hole in my back yard, because, you know, 
                              <emph id="d58070e883">she</emph> might see us."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e888">Jennie Hart soon came running back. She found Fred and Julie waiting for her with
                              the mouse.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e891">The three repaired solemnly to Fred's yard, and seated themselves on the back doorstep.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e894">"You, don't think it's a judgment upon me because we went 
                              <emph id="d58070e896">there</emph>—do you?" whispered Julie to Fred.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e900">"Nonsense, Julie!" replied Fred. "You have had that mouse ever since he was a baby.
                              I mean ever since 
                              <emph id="d58070e902">you</emph> was, and I don't suppose such things do live forever."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e906">"He was not then taken in his early flower?" Jennie made Kaycander say, with a very
                              stiff bow; for Kaycander possessed a fine straight spine, and was in truth the leg
                              to an old-fashioned bureau.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e909">Julie smiled through her tears, and thought Jennie was a funny girl to give a name
                              to a red bureau-leg.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e913">"I hope you don't object to a minister of color?" said Jennie, pleased to see Julie
                              smile, "because we are all anti-slavery; and so is pa."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e916">"The dear departed was not exactly white," said Fred.</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="52-53"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e921">"Sure enough," said Jennie, "but he's just as good for all that."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e924">"He's a good deal better," murmured Julie, affectionately. The little dress being
                              ready, Kaycander made another stiff bow, while Julie bent her head solemnly, and Fred
                              held his handkerchief to his mouth, instead of his eyes; for the ceremony did not
                              strike him as an occasion for tears.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e927">"I say unto you, Verily," began Kaycander, so exactly like a real minister, that Fred
                              pressed his handkerchief still more closely to his lips, "that all men are but as
                              the worms of the earth that perish; therefore a mouse is as good as a man; for verily
                              a mouse is as good as a worm, and some better."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e931">"Mr. K. Candor," interrupted Fred, "is a jolly come-outer, I take it."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e934">"Hush!" whispered Julie; and Kaycander continued,—</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e937">"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the Lord."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e940">"Would you say that, if you was me?" asked Julie.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e943">"What?" said Fred.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e946">"That about blessed, you know, I'm afraid it would be telling a lie—wouldn't it?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e950">"O, no; it wouldn't," responded Jennie, enthusiastically; "because, you know, he giveth,
                              too."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e953">"O, 
                              <emph id="d58070e955">she</emph> don't know how much he gives," Fred informed Jennie, "on account of 
                              <emph id="d58070e958">her.</emph>"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e962">"Blessed be the name of the Lord," whispered Julie. "I forgot."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e965">"Amen," echoed Jennie. "I do often."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e968">So the children buried the mouse, and Jennie ran home with her little minister, while
                              Fred, as he escorted Julie, whispered something to her that had been on his mind for
                              some time.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e971">"If you wouldn't call pa's and ma's opinion a judgment, Julie, I'd tell you something.
                              It's kind of good and kind of not. I thought I'd wait till she'd got gone before I
                              said anything about it. It's this: I'm going to school way off somewhere, to be gone
                              four years; and then I'm only coming back for a little while, for I'm going to college."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e975">"Fred, it does look like a judgment, or a special dispensation of divine Providence,
                              or something," said Julie, sadly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e978">"Of course it's something," said Fred.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e981">Julia sighed.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e984">"Are you sorry, though?" returned Fred, with<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="54-55"> </a></span> glee. "I say, Julie, you're my girl; now remember, and don't let the other fellows
                              say anything you while I'm gone. Good by, Julie;" and Fred gave Julie a quick, impulsive
                              kiss, and ran off, blushing and whistling.

                           <p id="d58070e998">THE princess was not poor: she owned a portion of the dungeon keep, and also quite
                              a large bag of gold dollars that were at present flying about in the disguise of little
                              paper birds, and that, when the princess married, or came of age, she could call in,
                              and change back to their former shapes, if she had the mind.

                              had a son, and, being a tender-hearted father, he saw not why his son should be denied
                              the pleasure of catching the birds. The cage was large enough for all; and, provided
                              the princess's mother bird would only let herself be caught, the young birds might
                              in time be brought to perch on the hands of father and son.

                           <p id="d58070e1004">The younger Mesher was a fat boy of about the same age as Fred—an unfinished impression
                              of the father, in somewhat softer and cheaper material. He was given to bewailing
                              his sins at the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="56-57"> </a></span> Sunday school, and to knocking down the smaller boys at the day school. He was very
                              greedy at table, and covetous generally.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1010">After Fred went away, the dull world turned itself over yet more slowly for Julie,
                              day by day month by month, and year by year, till the beautiful child grew into the
                              still more beautiful girl, Strange, happy dreams crept into the girl's life, and much
                              of its dulness stole out. Julie's "good one" was now to sit by her window and watch,
                              and Julie's watching was the instinct of a soul in search of its destiny. While her
                              fingers stitched away at her sewing, her imagination was busy over a thousand romantic
                              scenes. Her lovely face would sometimes flush with a bright rosy color and she would
                              glance shyly about the empty room, half suspecting some human eye upon her. At such
                              times she would say to herself, "Pshaw! I believe I think of nothing but beaux and
                              getting married. I even think of elopements, and that's worse." After reflecting thus,
                              Julie always fell back into her dreams straightway. The face she pictured was a lover's,
                              but not Fred's. She thought of Fred pleasantly, but as a child. Even now he would
                              be but a youth; and Julie's ideal was a strong man, tall and handsome, who loved Julie
                              desperately, thought her the most beautiful of women, and did not mind telling her
                              so occasionally, and taking her to the theatre.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1013">Julie met her lover in a great many imaginary ways. Sometimes he appeared at the church,
                              saw her, and waited outside till she should pass to slip a note into her hand; or
                              it would be night, and "some unheard-of errand would take her out alone, The "presiding
                              elder" would be taken dangerously ill, and Julie's errand would be for the doctor.
                              Some insolent person would speak to her, perhaps follow her; and 
                              <emph id="d58070e1015">he,</emph> the lover, would come to the rescue. Then he would call the next day while the step-mother
                              was out, and would say fascinating things to her, and again the next day, till at
                              last he would fall at her feet, and entreat her to fly with him. She would smile,
                              and answer sweetly, but sadly, "No, Edward, not that. I love you devotedly; but—but—"
                              and he would respond, "But what, dearest?" to which she would reply, "Consider Mr.
                              Mesher and my—" and he, being most charmingly worldly, would laugh with a careless,
                              easy grace, and respond, "Mesher be hanged"—a sentence which secretly would not sound
                              unpleasant to her, although she would answer to it with a severe, but still charming
                              lecture.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1019">Julie began, too, to look for a lover among the real faces she met. She would wonder
                              how such<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="30" data-tei-n="58-59"> </a></span> and such a young man would seem as a husband, supposing he should fall in love with
                              her. But she met with no eyes like the eyes in her dream, that burned into her very
                              soul, though there were many eyes that looked, and were charmed. The church and the
                              meetings also came to have a new attraction for her. It was not unpleasant to have
                              the men and women exchange covert glances, and whisper as she passed; and on the street,
                              too, although it startled her a little, it was still pleasant to have the passers-by
                              look after her with delight and wonder, as if she had been some rare flower borne
                              through the city's heart in the dead of winter. She would remember these looks, and
                              weave them into her dreams with a smile somewhat coquettish. There were other looks,
                              however, that did not haunt her pleasantly—the hypocritical faces of Mesher and his
                              son. Julie dreaded meeting either of these worthies about the house; for they never
                              failed, by some means, to bring a blush into her face, and a sickening terror into
                              her heart. Her dreams received, one day, a sudden shock. Her step-mother summoned
                              her. In the presence of that lady she was still a child. She had the old fear that
                              forbade her to speak her mind. The two Meshers were in the room also. Julie trembled,
                              and tried to think which of the acts she had lately committed could be laid to her
                              charge as sinful. She half feared that her worldly thoughts had revealed themselves
                              too plainly in her face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1024">"Julie," said Mrs. Mesher, briefly, "you are now a woman, and ready to enter into
                              the sphere of a woman. Simon Mesher offers you his hand."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1027">Julie turned pale, and instinctively drew back.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1030">"I have told him, as it was my duty," continued Mrs. Mesher, "that you are a vain
                              woman, one who esteems beauty of the flesh before beauty of the spirit, and a flippant
                              woman, one who would not respond to a devout Christian mind."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1034">Julie thought of her worldly lover, and was silent.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1037">"One easily led into worldly ambitions," went on Mrs. Mesher, still more sternly;
                              "but he is willing to overlook these qualities, and himself direct you in the path
                              of duty; prepare your mind, therefore, for the life that awaits you, that you may
                              become worthy of the privileges and duties of a wife." The step-mother's words seemed
                              harshly to cut the poetry of Julie's ideal like a sword. She dared not speak, and
                              her heart throbbed painfully. She could feel the small, fat eyes of the elder Mesher
                              half close themselves, while his thick lips murmured, "A willing bondage,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="31" data-tei-n="60-61"> </a></span> my daughter; yield up thy body and thy spirit unto him who is to be thy master. Take
                              her, Simon; take her. Deal with her gently, but firmly. Make of her a faithful wife
                              and obedient servant unto thee and unto the Lord, that she may minister unto thy bodily
                              and spiritual needs, and unto those of thy children, and be a silent and a cheerful
                              servant; for a loud-talking and self-willed woman offendeth the ears of the Lord."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1042">The elder bent his face close to that of the girl, drew her to him, and patted her
                              head with his hand, while the younger Mesher approached with a smile so repulsive
                              to Julie, that, terribly as she stood in awe of her step-mother, she sprang away from
                              the elder and ran to her own room, threw herself down into her chair, and, tossed
                              by conflicting emotions, wept. While the cold words of her step-mother touched her
                              ideal love like steel, the sensuality of the two Meshers seemed to taint it so, that
                              for days Julie thought of love and lovers with something like a shudder. After this
                              scene, she knew no peace. There was a new terror in the house for her. She stole about
                              like a thief, and lived almost entirely in her own room. She was so young, and knew
                              so little of the world, that these three beings seemed all-powerful to her. She trembled
                              lest she should be drawn into the sitting-room ting-room some day, and be forced to
                              marry the detestable Simon. She began now to watch for Fred's return, and wonder if
                              her old child-lover would still rescue her, as he used to promise, from the life that
                              was no longer simply dull. But Fred did not come; at least, Julie did not see him;
                              and she watched and waited in vain, till, little by little, an old fancy of her childhood
                              took possession of her, and she began to plan how she might escape from her prison
                              and join the dancers at the theatre. To do so, she must leave her home, and the "presiding"
                              would be sure to find her and bring her back. But this was not Julie's strongest motive
                              for lingering. Dull as the old house was, it was sacred to her because there her father
                              had blessed her on his death-bed. When Julie looked about her room, and saw her one
                              little chair, her bed, the patch-work quilt she had made with her own hands, the homely
                              scrolls on the paper her hungry eyes had made pictures and flowers of so often, and
                              the two stunted old bushes whose tops just peeped in at the window, she felt a tenderness
                              for these sharers of her solitude, and the thought of leaving them was like that of
                              leaving something human. Now, while Julie watched and waited, Fred had returned, a
                              tall, powerful youth, and still very much in love with her. Fred was at home, and
                              it so happened<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="62-63"> </a></span> pened that he rang the door-bell of the dungeon-keep just after Julie had broken
                              away from the elder, and was crying in her room. Fred did not observe the black look
                              of the step-mother, the shamefaced countenance of the younger Simon, nor the hypocritical
                              smile of the "presiding elder," who seemed still to rehearse the scene he had commenced
                              with Julie, and to gloat over it. There was something on Fred's mind that confused
                              the objects about him, and caused him to blush and turn pale alternately. Mrs. Mesher
                              motioned him, coldly, to be seated. He glanced about the room: there was no Julie
                              and no sunshine. He took the proffered chair, painfully conscious of the three pairs
                              of hostile eyes that were upon him. "Pshaw!" thought Fred; "what a baby I am!" Then
                              he spoke aloud, and his voice sounded dry and husky; not at all as he had planned
                              it should, in the seven or eight times he had passed and repassed, before entering
                              the house.

                           <p id="d58070e1050">Yes," answered Mrs. Mesher, distinctly. "What do you want of her?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1053">"To see her."</p>

                           <p id="d58070e1060">Fred felt the color mount to his temple; he had forgotten to introduce himself. "My
                              name is Frederic Somerby," he stammered. "I used to know Miss Ward—that is, I didn't
                              
                              <emph id="d58070e1062">know</emph> her," he added, troubled with a vague fear that, even at this late day, the disclosure
                              of the clandestine acquaintance of their childhood might compromise Julie in some
                              way. "I used to see her, and, in short, I called to say—to ask her permission and
                              yours to become acquainted with her. A fellow," said Fred, blushing still deeper because
                              he meant to use the language of a man, and it came more natural to be a boy, "don't
                              like to sneak round, when there's no reason why he shouldn't speak out. I—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1066">"Who is your father?" interrupted Mrs. Mesher, with hard, cold emphasis.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1069">"My father is John Somerby, and by profession a writer," answered Fred, finding this
                              unexpected catechism very embarrassing. Mrs. Mesher knitted her brow yet more severely
                              as she said,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1072">"A man who opposes the loud, boastful vanity of his reason against the Bible. Satan

                           <p id="d58070e1075">"No, he has not!" said Fred, with a sudden flush. "There isn't a better nor a wiser
                              man going than my father: he has faith in God, and good, whether in the Bible or out

                           <p id="d58070e1084">"I am proud to say I do, or try to," replied Fred, with warmth.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1087">"How old are you?" continued Mrs. Mesher.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1090">"Well," answered Fred, turning crimson, "I'm about seventeen, but I hope to improve
                              in that respect every day." And he added, to himself, "My mother 
                              <emph id="d58070e1092">does</emph> know that I am out. I suppose you'll ask that next."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1096">Mrs. Mesher fixed her eyes upon Fred sternly. "Go home," she said, "and in the Bible
                              learn the wisdom of humility. Understand, you are forbidden to enter this house. I
                              have considered my duty and the Lord's will in the matter of my daughter's future
                              well-being, and have bestowed her hand on a young man who is a servant of the Lord."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1100">Fred felt the blood leave his face and recede to his heart, and he sat motionless,
                              trying to decide whether or no his old love had received its deathblow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1103">"Any further conversation would not avail you," continued Mrs. Mesher; "therefore
                              I shall give my attention to other duties. Good morning."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1106">Fred made a nervous motion with his pale lips, as if to detain her; but he did not
                              speak, and she passed out of the room.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1109">Simon Mesher chuckled. The sudden dampening ing of Fred's ardor struck him as amusing,
                              and the elder half closed his eyes, and, mouthing his words with a relish, as was
                              his wont, he repeated, gently, "Understand, young man, you are forbidden this house.
                              This bondwoman of the Lord gives her young charge unto no man but my son, who is a
                              servant of the Lord, and a believer in his word. I need not tell you that to visit
                              this abode would be to violate the laws of propriety, and to trespass on the sacred
                              rights of the betrothed."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1112">Fred, jealous and exasperated, did not rise, but muttered, angrily, "I'll bet Julie's

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1118">"The betrothal," murmured the elder, sweetly, "has this day been consummated between
                              the young people, and the maiden's heart goes with her hand. Yes, yes. I have watched
                              the signs. The signs of a modest maiden's heart," continued Mesher,—perhaps inwardly
                              endeavoring to construe Julie's very decided show of repugnance for his son into the
                              wayward indications of love,—"are only revealed to those who look upon the young girl
                              with the tender watchfulness of a parent."
                           </p>

                              <emph id="d58070e1124">She</emph> didn't say," gasped Fred, suspicious and indignant<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="34" data-tei-n="66-67"> </a></span> dignant, "that there was any engagement. I'll be bound it's a mean invention of your

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1130">"The well-springs of my heart," went on the elder, with a forgiving look at Fred,
                              "have been this day touched, to witness the tender joys of their meeting. O, these
                              young hearts! O, these little fluttering love birds! They have melted mine old eyes
                              even unto tears, and the dry pastures of my heart have been refreshed and made green
                              with the waters thereof."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1133">Fred felt his blood rise. "Don't pretend you don't hear," he cried. "I said 
                              <emph id="d58070e1135">she</emph> didn't give any engagement as a reason why I shouldn't come here, and I should like
                              to know what you say to that."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1139">Simon Mesher again chuckled, but moved uneasily towards the door.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1142">"Peace, my son, peace!" responded the elder, favoring Fred with a look of sorrowful
                              reproach. "Let us not part with angry words on either side. They are vain, my son,
                              vain. Even though a stranger to me,—and on this tender occasion I shall be forgiven
                              if I say an intruder; yes, an intruder,—my bosom is filled with brotherly love, overflowing,
                              as I might say, with pure love for you, my poor misguided friend, and for all my fellow-creatures,
                              even my enemies. I pray for you, my son, that your heart may be turned from vain and
                              lustful thoughts. Ah, my son, think, consider,

                              touch of trouble, would be the means of bringing you unto

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1157">"Turn, to him yourself," muttered Fred; "or make 
                              <emph id="d58070e1159">him</emph> turn and forget 
                              <emph id="d58070e1162">her.</emph> I'd like to see either of you do it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1167">"Your sinful words fill me with grief," said the elder, mildly. "Intrude no longer
                              in the abode of a righteous love."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1170">"A righteous love! You lie; you know you do," sneered Fred, controlling, with a strong
                              effort, the impulse he felt to shake some other expression into young Mesher's face
                              than the stupid leer it wore.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1173">"He who calleth his brother a liar," said the elder, yet more mildly—"But I forgive
                              you, and send you forth more in sorrow than in anger; and I say to you, in the words
                              of the Lamb, 'Go thy way, and sin no more;' for the good book says, 'Thou shalt not
                              covet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant,
                              nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.'
                              O, my son," continued the elder, patting Fred's shoulder,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="68-69"> </a></span> "let not thine anger rise against the Lord's words, but soften thy hard heart unto—"

                           <p id="d58070e1178">"You can keep your hand off my shoulder," exclaimed Fred, seizing the elder's wrist,
                              and flinging the hand off.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1181">"My friend," said Mesher, a streak of red appearing, for an instant, over the natural
                              yellow of his flabby face, "raise not your hand against one, who, in meekness and
                              concern for your eternal welfare—But blush, and bow your head, for very shame; for,
                              behold, thou smitest me on the right cheek, and I turn unto you my left."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1184">"Here's a specimen for you!" cried Fred, with indignant contempt. "By George, you
                              ought to be pickled in rum, and put up in some museum among the monstrosities."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1188">If thine enemy smite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also," repeated
                              the elder, squeezing a few tears out of his closed eyes. "O, unhappy youth, my heart
                              bleeds for you; the heart of the aged servant of the Lord, whom thou hast this day
                              reviled, and turned against with the might of thy youthful hand, melts in sorrow for
                              your sin."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1191">Fred sprang up, and clenched his fist angrily. "If I could strike, or shake anything
                              out of you, but a parcel of lies, darn it, you old fool, I'd—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1194">"My son, my son, this is blasphemy: think, my son, blasphemy. Verily your sinful words
                              smite upon my soul with a smart that is like unto the smart of my body."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1197">"Verily," cried Fred, "you've spoken the truth for once in your life; for you haven't
                              soul enough to feel any contempt, and I didn't strike you."

                           <p id="d58070e1200">"My son," said the elder, "perhaps you are not aware what names your wicked words
                              call down upon your head—mocker! scoffer! Terrible words, my son—appalling words!
                              O, my son, consider them well, and repent!"

                           <p id="d58070e1203">Fred made an angry motion, as if to deal the elder a blow, but commanded himself.
                              "Go forth, Simon, and bring the police," said the elder, stepping back and turning
                              pale. "I feared it would come to this. You are witness, Simon, that I have borne with
                              meekness insults and blows in my own house. Go forth, Simon—go forth."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1207">"Your coward son went forth to save himself some time before your order," muttered
                              Fred; "so that game won't serve you. However, your aged heart needn't quake, and you
                              needn't hide behind the door, for I don't intend to strike; but I mean to find out
                              the truth, and all your noise won't prevent me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1210">Fred strode out of the house still pale with<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="36" data-tei-n="70-71"> </a></span> anger and indignation, and left the elder just in the act of casting up his eyes
                              preparatory to giving a righteous groan.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1215">He walked along the street with fierce rapidity, his hands still clenched, and his
                              brain on fire, with plans to rescue Julie, and thwart the fiendish schemes of the
                              elder; but when he came to find himself alone in his own room, the hands unclenched
                              themselves, and Fred lowered his head, and cried like a woman or a child. In his walk
                              and his planning he had but undone his own hopes; for, after all, what was there in
                              Mrs. Mesher's speech to give him reason to suppose the elder lied in the matter of
                              Julie's engagement. He had been angry before, and had not felt the blow to his own
                              hopes that was more cruel than the elder's exasperating words. Now he felt it, bowed
                              beneath it, and wept. He clung, however, to one last hope. Julie might not be a party
                              to the detestable bargain. He would see her, and learn the truth. With a fevered brain
                              he again stole round to the rear of her mother's house, and stood under Julie's window.
                              He remained some time ere he ventured to speak. With all the resolution born of his
                              trouble, he still felt timid at approaching the shrine of his idol; for in his mind
                              Julie had not ripened into a woman merely, but rather an angel, whom, as yet, he had
                              worshipped only at a distance. He glanced up at her window. The blinds were closed.
                              His heart sank; but he uttered her name as loudly as he dared. There was no answer.
                              He repeated it, and still there was silence. He returned home heart-sick, but not
                              discouraged. He came again and again, but always to find closed blinds, and no response
                              to his call. He watched for her in the streets with no better results. A suspicion
                              entered his mind, and gained strength day by day, that Julie was kept prisoner, and
                              that his unfortunate visit had brought about this extra severity. This thought, and
                              his helplessness in the matter, drove him desperate. He had kept strict watch over
                              the house for a month or more, when he observed, at times, a little figure, muffled
                              in shawls and closely veiled, steal in and out of the passage-way between Mesher's
                              house and the house adjoining. The figure was so completely disguised that only by
                              its light, quick step had Fred judged its youth. It might be his imagination; but
                              he fancied he could trace in its walk some resemblance to the child he had loved long
                              since. He resolved to observe more closely, and placed himself one day near the arch-way.
                              Whatever its mission, the figure seldom remained long about it, and Fred had not long
                              to wait. He took good<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="37" data-tei-n="72-73"> </a></span> care not to make his purpose apparent; but the figure was evidently on the alert,
                              for Fred had taken but a few steps in the same direction when it quickened its movements.
                              Fred accelerated his pace also, and the figure, alarmed, commenced running. Fred,
                              ashamed, desisted. Still it was not in his nature to abandon an undertaking he had
                              set his mind upon. So he gave himself another chance by cutting through a cross street,
                              and rounding a certain block of houses. This placed him in advance, and he stood waiting
                              till the figure should come up with him. That being was evidently still suspicious,
                              as it paused every now and then, and gave frightened glances about, and Fred felt
                              as little respectable as he appeared. Still he watched until the figure reached its
                              destination, which was but a few paces from where Fred had taken his station. It entered
                              the stage door of the theatre. He turned away more disappointed than he could have
                              believed possible. "What a fool I was!" he muttered. "It is some actress or ballet
                              girl." Still Fred did not banish this figure from his mind.

                           <p id="d58070e1233">Mrs. Hart read these words aloud, though she did not intend them for her daughter's
                              ear. It was her habit to read whatever she read to herself aloud, as if her mind was
                              a little hard of hearing, and the thing had to make some noise to be let in. The words
                              dropped like a spark into Gail's mind, and set fire to some very inflammable material
                              there. She had made efforts to get on the stage, but in secret. She instinctively
                              shrank from imparting even to those dear to her these attempts, as yet fruitless,
                              to win the thing she loved.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1236">"I believe I will try it," she said, half to herself. "Who knows what may come of
                              it?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1240">"What! become a play-actress?" ejaculated Mrs. Hart, with a mixture of curiosity and
                              astonishment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1243">"Not so bad as that," replied Gail, cynically, as<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="38" data-tei-n="74-75"> </a></span> certain heart-sickening visions of crushed hopes, closed stage doors, and managers
                              hard to see, and harder to make see, appeared before her mind. "An extra lady," she
                              explained, "is only some one to stand on the stage, and help make up the picture."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1248">"Well, at the same time, an extra lady is something more than a common lady," said
                              her mother, encouragingly. "I declare, it is over here to the Union Theatre," she
                              went on, after a few minutes, reverting to the paper with fresh interest. "I knew
                              of some one that used to act upon that staging; it's Mrs. Gray's daughter Lizzie and
                              Mrs. Barrows. Mrs. Gray herself took in their play dresses to iron."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1251">At another time Gail would have smiled at this innocent coupling of the star's name
                              with that of a poor ballet girl's. But at present she was too nervous at the thought
                              of approaching the dread shrine, even with so humble a petition. She rose somewhat
                              hurriedly, lest her resolution should fail, and hastened to her own room. With unsteady
                              fingers she dressed in her most theatrical style, feeling that her chance was bettered
                              by seeming to have been on the stage, or at least to be up to it. Before leaving the
                              house, she drew a veil over her face in true actress fashion.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1254">Poor Gail! it was something of a descent from her ambitious dreams to go on as a mere
                              supernumerary.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1257">Those in her little circle of friends who had seen her act had given her to understand
                              she could take rank with the first. But Gail was desperate, determined, and still
                              thoroughly in love with the idea of becoming an actress. The theatre had even become
                              sanctified to her by her childish worship of it. All its trickeries, painted faces,
                              and half-clothed dancers had been an enchanted world to her; for these things had
                              stepped into the heart of the child reverentially as on sacred ground, and bowed to
                              its pure instincts. She hastened on her way to the theatre, at first with an impulse
                              to plunge blindly through what was a disagreeable necessity; but as the fresh air
                              and exercise braced her, this shrinking gave place to a feeling of interest in what
                              she had undertaken, and a sense of delight in her own independence. In truth, when
                              the mood took her, Gail had mental muscle enough to like to feel herself standing
                              alone without leaning too much on the opinions of society. She threw from her face
                              the veil she had drawn over it. She thought, almost gayly, "I will take the experience
                              to mind rather than to heart, and by watching and study I shall not be the less of
                              an actress for my poor position."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="76-77"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1263">When she reached the theatre, she stopped for a moment outside the old door that had
                              so often filled her with awe, and wondered idly, if with the little stream of daylight
                              that should enter with her, the old enchantment would vanish like elves at cock-crow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1266">Though Gail was now a woman, time and doubt had not quite, like the wicked fairy's
                              wand, touched her enchanted beings into mere earthly forms. She had still for them
                              the old mixture of ideality and idolatry.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1269">The heavy stage door creaked harshly on its rusty hinges as Gail pushed it open, as
                              if it, too, grudged her entrance. All she could discern in the darkness within was
                              the appalling announcement, "Positively no admittance," written above her head. To
                              her nostrils came a strong odor of gas, paint, and dust, that she had sometimes perceived
                              on the rising of the curtain, and that had a charm for her, so was it associated with
                              the place. To-day, nervous and full of dreams for the future, this odor seemed to
                              mix itself subtilely with the breath of human aspirations, somewhat feverish. A feeble
                              ray of daylight filtered through a dirty window above, and mingled with the flame
                              of a single gas-burner, making it shrink within itself feebly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1272">After her eyes had become accustomed to the darkness, Gail found herself surrounded
                              by huge piles of scenes, leaning against the brick walls of the building. She was
                              about to penetrate further, when a curious little figure emerged from the gloom, and
                              presented to her sight a dry, serious face, and a rusty suit of copper color, the
                              prevailing tint of the canvases about—a creature that seemed to her to be soul and
                              body; a sort of parasitic growth of the material portion of the place. Somewhat timidly,
                              it must be confessed, in spite of her new-born courage, Gail inquired for Mr. Lennox,
                              the lessee and manager. The specimen showed no signs of having heard till he had slowly
                              and fondly deposited, one by one, an armful of masks, and gazed contemplatively into
                              space for a moment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1275">"Ah, Mr. Lennox," he said, musingly. "Mr. Lennox is at present at his theatre west."
                              The words theatre and Lennox were dwelt upon with a quiet but deep satisfaction. As
                              Gail waited, doubtful how to proceed, there appeared a genius, known as super, coarse
                              in feature, and threadbare in dress.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1279">"No, sir," cried this youth, with defiant familiarity; "Tom's not west neither. Tom's
                              here; saw him not two minutes ago; talked with him myself."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="78-79"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1284">His words, like those of the old man, were spoken with a relish, although his manner
                              was quite different. He only wished it understood that he and the manager were on
                              intimate terms, while the little man seemed to turn the name over carefully, as if
                              it had been some rare and precious stone; and as he lowered his voice to whisper to
                              her confidentially, Gail felt he could not allow his claims of ownership to be disputed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1287">"My dear young lady, he may be here, and he may not. Mr. Lennox is a very peculiar
                              man—a very peculiar man. You find him sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another."
                              The little man here took a step back, the better to observe the effect of this evidence
                              of eccentricity upon Gail, and continued, "He said to me,—in the strictest confidence,
                              mind you,—'My God, James, I wish they'd let me alone.' He has had," whispered James
                              impressively, "fifty applications for engagements in a single week; fifty—applications—in—a—single—week."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1290">Gail lost courage a little, although she only half believed the assertion. She replied
                              coldly, "I came in answer to the advertisement for ladies."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1293">James eyed her reproachfully, and in the manner of his answer indicated that he considered
                              even so humble a connection with the theatre as an honor.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1297">"Ah, indeed; then I think Mr. Lennox will confer with you," he intimated. "Or perhaps
                              you had better see Jerry Sands." Gail followed her conductor behind the scenes into
                              the presence of Jerry—a seedy-looking man, but genteel, one of whose eyes had the
                              appearance of having sported a glass till its impression had become permanent.

                           <p id="d58070e1300">"Balley?" murmured Jerry, without raising his face from the table before which he
                              sat.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1303">"The young lady wishes to engage in the new piece," replied James.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1306">"Father, husband, or big brother know you're here?" inquired Jerry, still with his
                              eyes on the table, but seeming to feel that Gail was new to the stage; "because, you
                              know, we don't want any of that sort of thing—girls engaging with us, and then leaving
                              on account of a row with the family."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1309">Gail assured him that he had nothing of the kind to apprehend in her case.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1312">"Very well, then; we'll give you one dollar a night, and find your dress. Will that
                              suit?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1316">"Yes."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1319">"Very well; give your address."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1322">Gail complied.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1325">This business over, and the rehearsal not yet come on, Gail found for herself a seat
                              on the stairs ascending to the scene-painter's gallery, where she<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="80-81"> </a></span> might watch without being conspicuous. She felt, however, little heart for gratifying
                              her curiosity. Something in the very atmosphere of the place seemed to discourage
                              her. She was disappointed. The first step in the experiment she had resolved to try
                              seemed rather to throw her farther off from her real object than to draw her nearer
                              to it. She seemed to feel, in the prevailing spirit about her, only invisible barriers.
                              Educated to an imaginary world, this taste of a harder and colder reality gave her
                              sensitive nature pain. The tears in her eyes blurred the desolate stage before her,
                              and perhaps the cloud over her spirits made dim the mind's sight also; for the beings
                              whom she had worshipped appeared to her as very weak and vain mortals indeed, aud
                              she shrank from the little slurs and the petty airs of superiority she fancied in
                              them. She watched the scene and the people about her, in truth, with a mind that was
                              proud, sick, hungry, and jealous—that aspired to worthier things, and was ashamed
                              of its own weakness. From the cold, gloomy stage came the voices of the rehearsers,
                              mumbling over their parts inaudibly, as if they were feeling about in the dark for
                              them—as perhaps they were, mentally. Only the cues were given with sufficient distinctness
                              to be heard. The actors and actresses wandered about with a sort of idle restlessness,
                              an absorbed self-consciousness, pervaded by a certain charm of their stage life, that,
                              even when they expressed themselves discontented with their profession,—as they not
                              unfrequently did,—was far more impressive than their words.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1330">Gail observed a certain figure pacing the stage behind the scenes—a woman, tall, thin,
                              and too quick and sudden in her motions for grace. She was a contrast, both in face
                              and manner, to those about her. She was not an actress. Any part would have expressed
                              her rather than she it. Behind her pale face and sharp gray eyes seemed to burn an
                              unsteady light that at times flushed the face, and at times left it to a dull pallor.
                              Her thin lips often moved nervously when she was not speaking. This woman's character
                              reflected Gail's mood; and perhaps through this odd sympathy she was moved to address
                              the stranger. At all events, she paused suddenly before Gail, and said, sharply,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1333">"What are you thinking about?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1337">"I am not thinking," answered Gail; "I am getting ready to think."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1340">"Do you know, now," said the lady, "I thought you were a genius? I said so to myself.
                              I am a genius also, only I am unappreciated. I do utility business. I am Isabel Lester."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="42" data-tei-n="82-83"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1345">"My name is Abigail Hart." And Gail would have added, "I, too, fancy myself a genius."
                              But this species of frankness did not come natural to her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1348">"Just hear them talk," whispered Isabel, after making a short pause, that seemed to
                              have a jerk in it as sharp and sudden as her motions. "They amuse me." Isabel indicated,
                              by a slight nod, two actors who had sauntered near the spot.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1351">"Hadley says he's sick of the whole business. Guess he'll throw up. And Dean isn't
                              much better pleased—been on the shelf ever since they opened," said actor number one.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1355">"I don't see what the fellows want to grumble for," responded actor number two. "I
                              should consider myself precious lucky if I had their chance—all pay and no work."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1358">"No play either, Mr. Andrews," put in Isabel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1361">"Why don't they go into something else, if they don't like the profession?" retorted
                              Mr. Andrews.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1364">"That's a mystery," said Isabel, biting her lips with an odd sort of impatience. "We
                              actors and actresses are always saying we don't like the profession, and yet we cling
                              to it as if we did. I know I'm perfectly lifeless outside the theatre; and I guess
                              others are, too, if they'd own up."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1367">In spite of Isabel's sharp manner of speaking, and alert way of glancing up when others
                              spoke, as if her wit was ready to pounce upon the slightest weakness, Gail felt she
                              possessed a certain vein of tenderness, and that her wit was more like a sharp surgical
                              instrument than a sword,—it would rather cure than kill. At this juncture, the ballet
                              mistress appeared. Gail recognized in her Mrs. Sands. She had not become a whit less
                              noisy or slatternly with years.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1370">"Are you engaged for the new piece?" she cried to Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1374">"I believe so."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1377">"Very good, my dear; and I honly wish I 'ad a dozen more like you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1380">"Take me, Meary?" said the voice of a gentleman behind her: "won't I do for a young
                              lady? I'll dance good, if you'll be my partner." The new-comer was fashionably dressed,
                              large and handsome, with a face somewhat flushed, and a look somewhat dissipated.
                              He had in his manner too much of the world outside, and too little of the ideal world,
                              for an actor. His presence created a little breeze of pleasure and coquetry among
                              the ladies; and Gail judged him to be Mr. Lennox.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1383">"I wish to God you would dance!" cried Mrs. Sands; "you'd keep the gals in order."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1386">"I guess they'd have to keep me in order,"<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="84-85"> </a></span> laughed the manager, embracing Mrs. Sands, and glancing at Gail.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1391">"For shame," answered the ballet mistress; "and you a married man, too."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1395">"Well, now, why not, Mrs. Sands?" said the manager. "Is the world worth being good
                              for?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1398">"Is it worth being bad for?" queried Isabel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1401">"My dear," said Lennox, "I never know what you're driving at when you speak."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1404">"Perhaps you're not used to hearing the truth. I happen to mean, just now, that it
                              don't pay to be bad, any more than it pays to be good; and in truth it doesn't pay
                              to 
                              <emph id="d58070e1406">be</emph> at all."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1410">Mr. Lennox laughed in an easy, off-hand manner, and made his exit.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1413">"Isabel, my dear," said Mrs. Sands, seriously, "I wouldn't speak so to Mr. Lennox.
                              Mind you, I know you don't mean any 'arm, but I'd 'ave respect for a man that's older
                              than me, and that has two theatres, one 'ere and one west, and the hopera besides."
                              The ladies here began to complain that the rehearsal was late.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1417">"You can't blame me, I'm sure," cried Mrs. Sands, loudly, but not offensively. "I've
                              been 'ere since nine o'clock, and, mind you, at the same time I don't blame you. Our
                              own ladies is always in time, and it's not Tom Lennox's fault either, nor any that
                              manages under him. There isn't a better manager anywhere than Tom Lennox, and I don't
                              care who 'ears me say so. I've played business under Father Symonds, too, and in the
                              old country 'icks of the Surrey. But, mind you, I'd rather be ballet mistress under
                              Lennox than the whole lot of 'em."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1420">"Why, yes, one's enough," said Isabel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1423">The other ladies, catching Mrs. Sands's spirit, began of one accord to praise the
                              handsome manager; but notwithstanding this, Mrs. Sands so relished her position as
                              champion, that she must continue in the same strain. "And my advice to you, one and
                              all, is, Mr. Lennox does the fair thing by you, and so I tell you now."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1426">"I'll take your advice for one," said Isabel. "It isn't grammar or sense we should
                              prize; it's the good heart. Don't you think so, Mrs. S.?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1429">"Has you say, Mrs. 'Hel, it's the 'art we should prize," said Mrs. Sands, whose good-natured,
                              careless way of listening took none of the sarcasm of the speech, and who was quite
                              unconscious of having given her sentence a more applicable meaning by knocking the
                              
                              <hi id="d58070e1431" style="font-style: italic;"></hi>h from heart.

                           <p id="d58070e1434">"Damn you, darlings, get on with your rehearsal," cried Blowper, the stage manager.
                              "We haven't got all day to wait."

                           <p id="d58070e1440">Mrs. Sands, who received in this order the first intimation that the rehearsal of
                              the dance might proceed, anxiously hurried the ladies upon the stage, and began placing
                              them in couples, imploring each in turn to do her best.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1443">Gail, who had become weary and nervous in her position as spectator, began to feel
                              renewed interest. Here was something to do, and already her mind was alert to do it
                              artistically. But the dance, under Mrs. Sands's management, was anything but encouraging.
                              Her character, like her dress and manners, might be called slipshod. Authority was
                              only pinned into her nature, as her dress was pinned on her. Any tread, rough or gentle,
                              trailed it down into the dust.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1446">"Now, then, gals, take your places as you 'ad them yesterday," she ordered, with a
                              voice sufficiently loud, but in which there was no real determination, "and when I
                              call one, two, three, and you 'ear the music, 'tee dum, tee dum tee dee, tee 
                              <emph id="d58070e1448">dar,'</emph> all start on tee dar. Now, then—one, two, three; start. My God, you're late, be'ind
                              there; and, you in front, where's your 'ands round? Your places, your places, quick.—[To
                              the violin.] Once more, Sig. Bruno, if you please. One, two, three—hintirely 
                              <emph id="d58070e1451">hout.</emph>"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1455">"Of course it all goes wrong, Mrs. Sands," said an offended dancer. "What can you
                              expect? There's a set of people here who don't know the first thing about dancing."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1458">"The trouble is," said another, "we are not rightly placed. I'm first bally, and Smith
                              is second. So, of course, we ought to lead."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1462">"To be sure," cried Mrs. Sands. "Who says you shan't? And now, mind you—"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1465">"Mr. Blowper told me to stand here," interrupted the offending party. "Of course,
                              it is nothing to me. All is—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1468">"Well, my dear, you can stand be'ind; you're seen just as much there as anywhere;
                              and mind you, gals, you're all leaders in this dance, and at the same time Miss Smith
                              and Miss Burns takes the front; and now, again. One, two, three." Still the refractory
                              dancers refused to start on tee dar, but not only consented to start a few moments
                              latter, but to continue dancing out of time, in spite of Mrs. Sands's vociferous cry
                              of, "Hout with the music, my dears. Fall into your 'ands round, quick; not you be'ind—you
                              in front, there." Nor was a clearer perception of the dance diffused among them when
                              Mr. Blowper repeated the order a little too late for its proper execution, and shouted,
                              "For a set of d——d handsome gals, you've got about as little brains as I ever saw."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e1473">The dancers were only stayed by symptoms of an open warfare between "our own ladies"
                              and the extra ladies.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1476">There had existed ill will in the hearts of both parties, expressed by "our own" in
                              under-tone sarcasms and innuendoes, and by the extra in a sort of impenetrable obliviousness,
                              that was in its character exasperating.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1480">"We were all right enough," cried the voices of several, endeavoring to make themselves
                              heard above the voices of several others; "if it hadn't been for those two girls from
                              the Ash Street—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1483">"If you mean me and Henny," interrupted a solid voice from the crowd, "you'd better
                              hold your tongue. We know as much as you do."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1486">"My God, I like their impudence," muttered a partisan of eccentric taste.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1489">"'Ush, 'ush, 'ush!" cried Mrs. Sands; "and go back to the beginning, every one of
                              you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1492">This command not having the desired effect, Mrs. Sands resorted to more soothing measures,
                              and whispered to each dancer, in turn, as she replaced her, "Now, mind you, I depend
                              entirely upon you; you've practised for a dance, and we can't expect those as 'asn't
                              to do as well as those as 'as;" but with all her efforts, the rebellion was only turned
                              back into its former mode of expression.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1495">"Now, then," said Mrs. Sands, stopping to take breath and survey the rehearsers, "we
                              have height on one side, and height on the other,"—which was quite true. "So we can
                              start fair again—the 'ole sixteen. Now, then, again. One, two, three;" and the whole
                              sixteen started fair. But as each of "our own ladies" had an independent notion of
                              the figures, and the extra ladies had no notions whatever, but, to use an expression
                              of "our own," stood and "gawped," they proceeded otherwise. But still Mrs. Sands,
                              beating time emphatically, shouted the figures—"'Ands around, you four front couples,
                              and circle at the back. Now, then, the reverse. Form a line. That brings you down
                              in front,—you're not in a line, my dears,—and then your 'butterfly' 
                              <emph id="d58070e1497">and</emph> the 'bayaderes' are on. Too late with your 'butterfly.' For God's sake, your tableau,
                              quick!" shouted Mrs. Sands, desperately; whilst the stage manager swore and gesticulated
                              in a most unintelligible manner; and two ladies, whom Gail had previously seen, in
                              soiled slippers and short dresses, solemnly, and with distressed faces, kicking at
                              each other from opposite wings, bounded on to the stage, and began a most alarming
                              succession of rapid movements, regardless of spots already occupied by preoccupied
                              artists, who ought to have been, but who were not, out of the way.

                           <p id="d58070e1504">A number of small collisions, of course, took place.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1507">"My God! give us the stage!" cried the bayaderes, breathlessly, but without pausing.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1510">The dancers scolded each other.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1513">Mrs. Sands shouted, "My dears, my dears, this will never do at night! We shall be
                              ruined! Now, then, again; your slow movement, quick!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1516">This unlooked-for order dissipated what little idea of the dance existed among the
                              dancers; and Mrs. Sands was fain to start afresh.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1520">"But not at the beginning!" she cried. "Your butterfly. On one foot, my dears!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1523">The butterfly was no sooner commenced, however, than the rehearsal terminated quite
                              unexpectedly, on account of the solitary violinist, who had furnished the music, disappearing
                              under the stage, suddenly, like a genius of some sort. Indeed, before his final exit,
                              the stout Italian leader had been waxing cold and dismal; and more than once Gail
                              had fancied she heard, about his vicinity, something that sounded like "Sacramento—damn!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1526">Gail returned home from the rehearsal almost discouraged, and not very pleasantly
                              excited. There was little to hope for from the dance; and the coarse, disrespectful
                              familiarity of the stage manager, conflicted painfully with her sense of refinement
                              finement and dignity. However, it was too late to retract. So Gail prepared her dress
                              and her mind for the coming ordeal, and still hoped for a happier issue. Two or three
                              more similar rehearsals brought the night of the play.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1529">As Gail crossed the stage, she fancied a suppressed spirit of excitement lurked about
                              the closed dressing-room doors, that was mocked by the dismal wail of some instrument
                              under ground, and that contrasted with the lonely creaking of boots and slamming of
                              doors by the few early arrivals in front. The dressing-room, she found, was unpleasantly
                              close and crowded, and her welcome anything but cordial.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1532">"Well, I'll give up! How ever I'm to get you a body I don't know!" exclaimed the mistress
                              of the wardrobe, Mrs. Howe. "Body" was Mrs. Howe's term for waist.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1535">"Who sent you here?" cried one of the ladies. "If it's that prompter, you ask him
                              if he'd like to have us dress in the flies, or the painter's gallery. We'll do anything
                              to oblige him."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1539">Gail was not moved to comply with this request, but stood for a second in doubt what
                              to do next, thinking one body, under the circumstances, was as much as she could dispose
                              of. "You come here, and don't mind her," said Mrs. Howe. "You've as good a right to
                              the place as anybody." Mrs.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="47" data-tei-n="92-93"> </a></span> Howe was a stout, bustling woman, and was at present engaged in sorting over a large
                              bundle of "bodies" and "trunks"—an operation which filled up no small portion of the
                              already over-crowded room. Indeed, three little human bodies might be said to be literally
                              shelved; for they peered down from a nook in Mrs. Sands's dressing-place, where they
                              were stowed away until such time as they should be required. Gail afterwards learned
                              to know them by the names of "the little Italian brother," "Mrs. Sands's sissy," and
                              "that brat Jerry picked up." The brother possessed eyes larger than his nose or mouth,
                              which gave him a melancholy expression. His skin, moreover, on coming to dress him,
                              was found to be made so many shades darker by dirt than nature or Italy intended,
                              that Mrs. Howe exclaimed, "Well! was ever anything like it?—for that dirty wretch
                              of a Lumbini to bring this child up here in his every-day skin!" She proceeded to
                              cover the difficulty by a vigorous application of chalk, and then to array him in
                              a low body, in which he looked more forlorn than ever. "Sissy" had an old face, pale
                              and sharp, with weak eyes. She could say bright and impertinent things with equal
                              felicity, and "'ad quite a turn for learning," Mrs. Sands said. Indeed, she lost no
                              time in soliciting the information as to "how old Mrs. Howe might be; what made her
                              nose so red; and why she didn't have hair on the top of her head." Later in the evening,
                              Mrs. Sands discovered these three children asleep behind some properties at the back
                              of the stage, and aroused them in a very sneezy, snuffly condition. Sissy was duly
                              scolded, and recommended, by her mother, to "'eat her feet before going hon."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1544">The languid dullness of the rehearsals had given place, in the dressing-room at least,
                              to a reactionary excess of spirits. Gail heard related many lively reminiscences of
                              other theatres and engagements, and learned that, at other theatres, each lady present
                              had played "business." She also had occasion to note a peculiar coincidence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1547">Each lady, with only one or two exceptions, had just entered her seventeenth year.
                              Isabel remarked thereat, "That's right, girls: I like to see constancy in all things.
                              I say, get an age, one that you really do like, and stick to it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1550">Mrs. Sands, who had dressed herself in a matter-of-fact way, with neither taste nor
                              vanity, and who had been taking her part in the conversation in a manner by no means
                              less lively than the others, quite unexpectedly changed her tone. "Gals, I'm in a
                              fit of the blackest blues!" she exclaimed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1553">"Why, what's the matter with you?" inquired<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="48" data-tei-n="94-95"> </a></span> one of the merriest of the girls, who was engaged in establishing a curl over one
                              eye, talking and laughing the while.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1558">"I'm sure I don't know," reflected Mrs. Sands; "I've hevery thing to make me 'appy.
                              There's Martin, with his pranks and jokes; 'e's enough to put the 'art into anybody."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1562">Martin was a vapid-looking youth, who did errands for the box-office. He had been
                              seen in the morning permitting himself to be embraced by the ladies, and from his
                              lips had issued the following scintillation of wit:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1565">"Ladies! ladies! Now, really! O! Ah!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1568">"I believe," went on Mrs. Sands, "I should pick up a bit if you gals was to stand
                              me treat for a mug of beer. It wouldn't come 'ard on any of you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1571">The girls promised, and Mrs. Sands reciprocated by calling herself Mother Goose, and
                              the ladies her little geese.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1574">Gail was somewhat timid about descending in her strange dress until such times as
                              the others should be ready; but as the room was far from comfortable, she stepped
                              outside the door, and, from the rough gallery where she stood, she could see the ropes
                              and rigging of the theatre.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1577">In a vast space above the stage, almost twice as high as that portion which is seen
                              from the auditory, were the dim outlines of dragons, cloud cars, and all manner of
                              strange shapes. About her were the great coral reefs to be used in the last act, to
                              you, in the enchantment of a little distance, a vast spangled grotto, where sirens
                              glance out from sparkling shells that glow, now red, now green, now white, in the
                              changing light; jewels turning from ruby to emerald, and from emerald to diamond.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1581">The other ladies being ready, Gail descended with them to the stage. She found managers,
                              actors and actresses, carpenters and scene-shifters, in a state of much excitement,
                              and herself in a crowd of demons, dragons, knights, monks, slaves, ladies, fairies,
                              and hobgoblins. There was a strong infusion of super and swearing, and none of the
                              motley throng were in the best of humor. The poor little fays exhibited a very mortal
                              anxiety for their toes and their dresses, and the knights were no more human than
                              the dragons in their efforts to place themselves in their proper rank in the procession.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1584">Gail was thankful when the music sounded, and the great discordant mass was sifted
                              through a side wing on to the stage, and into perfect harmony.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="49" data-tei-n="96-97"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1589">Poor as the position was, and as much pain as it had caused her, Gail felt something
                              of a thrill when she found herself standing on the stage for the first time, surrounded
                              by so dazzling a multitude, and fronting a vista of shining halls, golden pillared
                              and sparkling in tinted lights. She felt that the least had a part to play in the
                              beauty of the whole, and she took care that her own attitude should conform to the
                              general harmony.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1592">When the curtain came down on this gay scene, everything else came down also. The
                              fairies descended among rough boards and some rough language, with no wings to help
                              them fly from harm. The piece, so carelessly rehearsed, as far as one little dance
                              was concerned, seemed at night to have become a matter of life and death.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1595">Between each act it was as if a mania for destruction had seized the scene-shifters.
                              Scenes bore down directly in the way of casual by-standers in a most alarming manner.
                              One genteel individual, who had engaged as a "super" out of curiosity, was most unfortunate.
                              Wherever he sought refuge, some heavy article on castors, directed by some unseen
                              impetus, made its way towards him with fearful speed. Or he would hear from above
                              a voice shout, in language one might expect from below, "Keep out of the way, if you
                              don't want your damned head broke!" and before the knowledge that it was he who was
                              meant could dawn upon his perceptions, 
                              <emph id="d58070e1597">down</emph> would slam some large property within an inch of his person. Perhaps judging the
                              green-room to be the safest place for a novice, under such pressing circumstances,
                              he repaired to that apartment somewhat hastily, closely pursued by a "scene," the
                              destination of which appeared to be 
                              <emph id="d58070e1600">his</emph> destination, and its course 
                              <emph id="d58070e1603">his</emph> course, however he might dodge and diverge to get clear of it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1608">At intervals, little swarms of fays would light on the big round of the act drop,
                              and be scared off by the lively tendencies of inanimate objects, or the unexpected
                              hitching up of the curtain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1611">The stage manager—a stout, apoplectic character, who, to use Mrs. Sands's expression,
                              was apt to be "spleeny"—appeared to be in his element. There were some large squares
                              of looking-glass to be used in the last act that seemed to awaken the most intense
                              emotional interest in this man's breast. In the course of the evening he created a
                              general panic by groaning out, "My God, we're ruined! Every bit of that glass gone
                              to smash, and the whole piece rested on it." No wonder it was broken.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1614">It turned out, however, to be only a crack of the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="50" data-tei-n="98-99"> </a></span> mind on the part of the manager, for the glass was found quite safe.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1619">Every now and then, this man would appear in the wings talking and gesticulating so
                              violently that at first Gail took fright lest some immediate danger to life or limb
                              were apprehended from some invisible source, and was relieved to find it was only,
                              "My God! put down your border lights, or we're smashed;" or, "Damn you, lower your
                              flies;" and that "we're smashed" referred to the piece, and not to the people. No
                              one seemed much disturbed by his way of proceeding, and the play went on quite smoothly
                              in spite of him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1622">It appealed, however, that there was ill feeling towards him in the hearts of the
                              scene-shifters, one of whom was heard to mutter to himself, "Damn him, if I had my
                              way, I'd travel over it,"—meaning the manager's favorite glass.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1625">With some jostling and promiscuous prompting, from all concerned, the dance was successfully
                              spoiled. But to cover the defeat, the bright butterflies, whom Gail had seen in the
                              grubbing process, came floating about the stage—beings that seemed as if they could
                              have been born of no low thing, but were the beautiful offspring of the natural union
                              between motion and music,—so did they float into harmony with its dreamy movement
                              ment, and twinkle into brightness with its merry moods.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1629">Gail began, after not many nights, to sicken of her monotonous, unsatisfactory duties,
                              and the silly jingle and tawdry dresses of the piece. From watching, hoping, and striving
                              to make the most of her little part, in order to impress the management favorably,
                              she had fallen into hopelessly picturing improbable scenes and events, in which the
                              manager should recognize her genius, and straightway advance her to the foremost ranks,
                              or falling into little spasms of excessive nervousness at the thought of appealing
                              to him in his office.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1632">Behind the scenes he usually appeared good-natured, though often a little intoxicated.
                              But in his office, on pay days,—the only occasions when Gail saw him there,—he was
                              always sober, not to say cross. And the little scene which invariably transpired,
                              did not encourage the timid girl to reveal her secret aspirations to him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1635">Mr. Lennox occupied one side of the table, with his face bent uncompromisingly over
                              various papers and programmes, while opposite to him sat the paymaster, who appeared
                              to have a chronic objection to paying anything.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1638">He tolerated the "company," each one of whom always greeted him with, "Ah, Mr. Macks,
                              we're<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="51" data-tei-n="100-101"> </a></span> never sorry to see you on pay days." But as regarded "the extra ladies," he would
                              express himself "dead beat," or "blowed," if ever he "saw that face on," at all.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1643">He would begin with each lady by offering first a quarter, then a half of what was
                              due; and not until Mrs. Sands had had what she called a "bout with Macks," would he
                              pay the whole.

                           <p id="d58070e1655">IT was getting on towards "positively the last night," and already the old show piece
                              had to dispute its way with "off nights" and "benefits."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1658">Gail stood in the wing reflecting on this fact, and on the step she had taken. She
                              was in no very sanguine humor, and her object seemed more hopelessly distant than
                              ever. No one had discovered innate talent in the manner of her walk, her dress, or
                              the way in which she stood on the stage,—for she did no more,—the dance having dwindled
                              into a mere tableau in the background. There was nothing left but the old story—to
                              tease, and plod her way up.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1661">Even could she achieve it, Gail did not look upon the second round of the ladder with
                              much more favor than the first. Self-possession and a knowledge of stage business
                              could as well be acquired in the study and performance of parts true to human nature
                              as those that were not. In truth, she felt that her genius had as good a chance of
                              progress and development in the standing lady as in the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="52" data-tei-n="102-103"> </a></span> walking lady, a stiff little being, who, when she has said, "Nay, uncle," or "Pray
                              explain, guardian," is made to stand on the stage through scenes at least calculated
                              to awaken her interest, if not her emotions, with no mode of expression but that given
                              to dumb animals or idiots—pantomime.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1667">The manager's office was situated near the spot where Gail stood, and occasionally
                              she caught the sound of his voice and that of the prompter in conversation. Suddenly,
                              words fell on her ear that caused her to turn first red, then white, and made her
                              heart beat with painful violence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1670">A new-comer had joined the couple in the manager's room—a gentleman who was to play
                              Mercutio on the following night. The occasion was his own benefit, and an actress,
                              celebrated in the part of Romeo, had been especially engaged by him, to add her performance
                              to the attractions of the bill.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1673">"Here's a pretty to do," cried this new-comer; "a note, at the last moment, from Miss
                              Ceelems, announcing that she's sick, and can't appear as Juliet to-morrow night."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1676">"The deuce!" exclaimed the manager.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1679">"The dickens!" echoed the prompter.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1682">Gail's heart beat faster, and she breathed with some difficulty, for a very wild idea
                              flashed into her brain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1686">"It's a shame," continued Mercutio, warmly; "it's personal spite, and nothing more.
                              Some people give themselves airs. She would, at best, only go on for the part. I knew
                              that girl when she was glad to get utility business. For Heaven's sake, is there any
                              one else 
                              <emph id="d58070e1688">up</emph> in the part?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1692">Gail's quickened hearing caught every sound.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1695">"Who should there be, my dear fellow?" said the manager, taking his cigar from his
                              mouth. "Our juvenile lady is off on a furlough, and really ill, besides. Put up something
                              else, my boy; 'tis your only chance."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1698">"As good throw up the whole affair," muttered Mercutio; "and I can't do that. It's
                              too late."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1701">Gail blessed Mercutio.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1704">"But, my dear sir," said the prompter, in a tone of soft, tolerant impatience, "this
                              is no time to come to us with a story like that. O, good gracious, no! Why, the posters
                              are all out, with Mrs. Hazledean's name in print."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1708">"It's no fault of mine," said Mercutio, moodily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1711">"But what shall we do? what shall we do?" repeated the prompter, still appealing to
                              Mercutio, with a sort of mild reproach. "Have you the doctor's certificate that the
                              lady is really ill?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1714">"Ill or shamming," said Mercutio, "she'll never play at my benefit; not if there's
                              a Juliet to be found on earth."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="53" data-tei-n="104-105"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1719">At that moment appeared—from the tomb it would seem, to judge from her white, frightened
                              face—a Juliet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1722">"Let me play the part; I have studied it, and rehearsed it often," pleaded Gail, when
                              she could command herself sufficiently to conceal her agitation a little.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1726">The three old stagers eyed the little victim to the stage mania as if they had never
                              seen such a specimen before. The prompter was the first to break the silence, which
                              he did softly and helplessly, still in an appealing manner.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1729">"O, good gracious, Tom, here's a go off. Why, the lady must have taken leave of her
                              senses. But what are we to do? what are we to do?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1732">This prompter was not only soft spoken, but soft appearing also; fat, and with light
                              eyes, and an habitually worried expression. He stepped softly also, even when not
                              on duty, and his whole manner seemed to say, "O, my goodness! you are forgetting yourself,
                              and making too much noise." He had given human nature up long ago, as a thing full
                              of whims, that could not be got to conform sensibly to the adopted rules of the world—by
                              world he meant stage world—a thing ridiculous enough, but that must be tolerated.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1735">"Suppose you try me," continued Gail, gaining a little courage from the very desperation
                              of the case. "There is the rehearsal; if I fail at that, or if that would leave you
                              no time to get some one in my place, try me to-night on the stage, after the piece
                              is over."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1738">The manager tapped the table with his finger, and Mercutio kept his eyes on the floor,
                              while the prompter murmured, "Dear, dear me! here's a hopeless case; something must
                              be done, surely."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1741">His tone stung Gail a little—made her a little angry; still, in the dead silence that
                              followed, she did not gain in confidence. She turned from the prompter, and intuitively
                              felt the pulse of the two others. She was not encouraged by the result. Mercutio looked
                              supercilious and forbidding, while, to win Mr. Lennox, who was a man of impulse and
                              pleasure, she must be pleasing and Gail not only shrank from assuming any of the little
                              coquettish pleadings that might influence such a man, even, in so important a decision;
                              but her sense of honor forbade such a course. She could not decide. The silence embarrassed
                              her, and forced her to speak.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1745">"I know I am asking a very great favor," she said, with a sudden flush overspreading
                              her face, "and one that must seem ridiculous to you, with your experience of the stage
                              mania, and the little it often means besides self-illusion. I know, too,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="106-107"> </a></span> that giving the chance to a stranger might occasion discontent in your company. But—let—We
                              all have to make a beginning somewhere, and I am only unfortunate in being obliged
                              to speak without even the poor introduction that almost any one else might get. But
                              if you have any faith in the old proverb, that 'where there's a will there's a way,'
                              you need not be afraid to at least grant me a trial, where there is so little risk."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1750">Gail ceased speaking, with a confused sense that she had not bettered her cause, and
                              had only given the manager the cue for a dozen excuses for getting rid of her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1753">She was not a little surprised when Lennox bent his handsome face towards her, and
                              spoke in a manner at once so kind and polite, that she felt the tears start to her
                              eyes. She bit her lip quickly to check them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1756">"My dear girl," said the manager, "you do not realize what you propose. One of our
                              oldest actresses would hardly succeed under such circumstances."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1759">"Perhaps a young one would," answered Gail, a spark of native wit getting the better
                              of her embarrassment.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1762">Lennox smiled graciously, and was pleased; still he continued, "It's a very different
                              thing to do well at a rehearsal, with only one or two about, than when you have a
                              thousand before you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1766">"True," said Gail; "but the second ordeal is the less trying."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1769">"How do you know that?" asked the manager.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1772">"With the instinct of an actress," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1775">Unknown to Gail, the tide worked a little in her favor. It so happened that Lennox,
                              in his frequent visits behind the scenes, had been not a little impressed by her.
                              She had awakened his curiosity and interest, without, however, pleasing him. She had
                              taken the careless, gallant compliments it was his habit to pay the ladies of the
                              theatre, with a mixture of sensitiveness, sarcasm, and coldness, that was not at all
                              flattering, but that, while it piqued him, made her favor seem the more desirable;
                              and now that he saw her face lightened by the intensity of her desire, and felt her
                              wish to please him manifested in her tone, half proud and half pleading, he felt an
                              interest in the odd little scene just taking place, that, with a less attractive heroine,
                              would have been simply annoying. He reflected that a fine figure and a fine dress
                              cover a multitude of deficiencies in talent, and made up his mind to grant the trial.
                              He turned to Mercutio, and whispered, aside, "There is no one else up<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="55" data-tei-n="108-109"> </a></span> in the part; and suppose we try the lady. She is not bad looking."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1780">"I've no objection to listening to the lady's reading of the part, if you say so,"
                              answered Mercutio, aloud, and with no very good grace. "It's bad business, at best;
                              and I suppose we can cut the part—that is, if she succeeds after a fashion."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1783">"You may 
                              <emph id="d58070e1785">kill</emph> the part if you cut it," answered Gail, anxiously; "at least, let me try first."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1790">"If the bills were not out," said Mercutio, without heeding Gail, "we might have made
                              a 'first appearance' of it, and perhaps saved ourselves in that way; but, as it is,
                              don't, for God's sake, mention it outside the building till to-morrow night."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1793">Poor Gail stood by, eagerly drawing the honey out of this speech, too much elated
                              to heed its rudeness. She gave her hand to the manager, however, with some words very
                              grateful and unbusiness-like.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1796">"My dear," answered the manager, retaining the hand, "I am pleased to have it in my
                              power to gratify a lady;" and he lowered his voice, with a look of admiration that
                              startled Gail a little. "You shall have it your own way, my dear. The part shall not
                              be cut; and I think there'll be no danger but that you will appear at night. It 
                              <emph id="d58070e1798">depends on me</emph> to decide, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1802">Gail felt the color rise in her cheeks. She could not be altogether blind to the tone
                              and emphasis of the manager's last sentence, and she hurriedly gave one of those answers
                              that are born of a mingling of emotion, conscience, instinctive purity, policy, and
                              wit. "No, it must depend on my own ability and your judgment," she said. "I could
                              not think of taxing your kindness further."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1805">Lennox was a little puzzled, but took his cue from the tone, which, coming more directly
                              from conscience, was somewhat decided and forbidding, and he bade Gail "good night"
                              a little coldly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1808">Poor Gail stood for an instant bewildered and scared; she seemed to be drawing her
                              great fortune by an awfully slender thread—the caprice of a man whose governing power,
                              both instinct and reason told her, was impulse. She had to thank his impulse for the
                              very chance she was dreaming over so wildly at the moment, for might he not easily
                              have engaged the leading lady of some other theatre? This thought made Gail dizzy,
                              standing, as she fancied herself, on the brink of a precipice. "After all, it is very
                              near the time, and it would cost them a great deal to hire an actress." Then, by a
                              fatal fascination, she peeped again into the abyss. "It seems strange, though, he
                              should be willing to trust so important a part<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="56" data-tei-n="110-111"> </a></span> to a stranger; but perhaps he does not really mean to trust me, but only lets me
                              rehearse, and yet he said—" Gail glanced up hastily to banish a troublesome idea.
                              The curtain was falling on the last act, and she had forgotten to go on. The omission
                              gave her an odd sensation. She seemed to have forgotten the old show piece for weeks,
                              instead of only for an instant. She hurried with the crowd to her dressing-room, and
                              began, apparently, to prepare for home, but, in reality, to abandon herself to the
                              new dream that had begun to weave itself about her senses. There was even more noise
                              than usual among the ladies of the piece, but Gail heard none of it, till her dream
                              was disturbed by a loud laugh in her ear.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1814">"What's the matter?" said the voice, when the laugh had ceased; "have you fallen in
                              love? or what? I've spoken to you three times, and you haven't answered me once."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1817">"I didn't hear you," replied Gail, trying to arouse herself. She might have added,
                              "I have been listening to the music in my dream," for her rapt face said as much.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1820">"I should think not," continued the voice. "You've been smiling away to yourself with
                              your eyes staring at I don't know what."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1823">"Let her alone," put in Isabel Lester, in her usual sharp way—"perhaps she's happy."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1826">"I wanted to know why you didn't go on," persisted the other lady. "I saw Seely peering
                              round there, and he'd notice if a girl stood an inch out of place, and report—the
                              spy."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1829">"I had something pleasant to think of, and forgot the scene," answered Gail. As she
                              glanced around the little crowd of faces turned towards her, her heart smote her that
                              she should be so much more fortunate than those who perhaps had hoped and hungered
                              with her, even though their outsides seemed to match so poorly with her soul, that
                              the thought had never entered her head before. Gail had dressed for home quickly,
                              in spite of her absorbed state, for she was eager to impart her good news. When she
                              crossed the dark stage on her way out, the manager and prompter had not left the building.
                              They stood together in one of the wings. Gail heard the prompter's well-known voice
                              murmuring in his well-known manner, "But, my dear sir, the case is wholly unprecedented—wholly
                              unprecedented."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1833">She did not wait to hear more, although she felt the prompter's mind was still running
                              on the late disgrace to stage convention, for she dreaded meeting the manager—she
                              could not tell why. There was nothing disrespectful in what he had said to her, and
                              yet, as she hurried along the street, she<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="112-113"> </a></span> seemed to be escaping from something in her newfound joy that pained her, shamed
                              her, and flattered her, in one breath. She still felt the pressure of the manager's
                              hand on her own, and heard the tone of his voice in her ear, uttering such words as
                              she had only heard in her wildest dreams. "He can't be a bad man," thought poor Gail,
                              "to rise so much above other managers as to dare to think and act for himself. To-morrow
                              I will speak more kindly—I mean politely—to him, as I ought to any one who has been
                              so good to me." The next moment she hid her face in her hands, as if to hide her blushes
                              from the darkness and from herself. She thought, "Perhaps this is what people mean
                              when they talk about the temptations of the stage. I don't want to please him only
                              because I think he has been good, but because I am afraid to offend him. I believe
                              I would do almost anything short of absolute crime rather than lose this chance. It
                              seems like life itself to me," she added with vehement intensity, "for I've hoped,
                              and planned, and thought so much about being an actress, that I had rather not live
                              than lose this chance, poor though it is." Gail did not, however, look upon it as
                              poor: on the contrary she reasoned, "They will be sure to want me when they see how
                              well I play." But she thought all manner of contradictory things, and was, in truth,
                              almost intoxicated by her sudden blissful luck. She had already lived so much in her
                              new dream that her life of yesterday seemed a thing of long ago. People in dreams
                              or in trance have very little sense of time. Already she could afford to jest, in
                              her own mind, at past disappointments. Her stage experience, until now, had made her
                              sensitive and taciturn. She had been wont to avoid all conversation concerning it
                              in the family, and it had been her habit, after the performance each night, to slip
                              into the house noiselessly, lest Mrs. Hart, whose curiosity in the matter was lively,
                              might be awake, and interrogate her as to the night's experience.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1838">To-night, as she entered, she even hoped her mother had not retired; for she was ready
                              to dance for joy, and light-hearted enough to have said all manner of silly things.
                              She began to wonder how the event could have seemed unnatural a few hours back.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1841">"Is that you, Abby?" called Mrs. Hart from the sitting-room. "Do come in and tell
                              me just what happened from the time you went inside the theatre till you got home
                              again."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1844">Gail answered this accustomed greeting of her mother's with a smile so happy and so
                              peculiar, that Mrs. Hart, who had been in daily expectation<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="58" data-tei-n="114-115"> </a></span> of her daughter's promotion, immediately divined the cause.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1849">"Isn't it splendid, mother? Only think, the very best part! It seems too good to be
                              true," cried Gail, unable to suppress her enthusiasm.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1852">"I don't know, Abby, about too good to be true," responded Mrs. Hart, in great excitement,
                              her face flushed with maternal pride; "it's what I've all along told you. I've always
                              said about that Union Theatre, and those stage managers, that if you'd only let them
                              alone, they'd come to you, and beg of you to take the best parts; and now I hope you
                              see that your mother knew best."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1856">Gail was too happy to explain that her case was a peculiarly fortunate one.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1859">"If you had only minded me," went on Mrs. Hart, getting a good deal confused, as the
                              necessity of an immediate preparation for the performance impressed itself upon her,
                              "you'd have had things in readiness. I don't suppose, now, you've the first thing
                              to wear."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1862">"But perhaps I may not get the part to play," intimated Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1865">"There's my green alpaca," said Mrs. Hart, "my 
                              <emph id="d58070e1867">new</emph> one, if it would only fit."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1871">"Sure enough," said Gail, not in reference to the alpaca, however; "it would be as
                              well to think about something to wear in case of need."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1874">"Now, if it had only been Romeo you had been 
                              <emph id="d58070e1876">'cast up in,'</emph>" continued Mrs. Hart, reflecting with some vanity on her knowledge of stage phrases,
                              "we could have done first rate, and no thanks to any one; for there's those white
                              summer pants of William's, he's outgrown them, and they're bran new. I always thought
                              it was foolish, his getting them so late in the season, when he was just in the growing
                              age."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1881">"How absurd, mother!" laughed Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1884">"Well, I don't know that it is," replied Mrs. Hart, warmly; "women do play Romeo—there's
                              Charlotte Cushman herself, she played it, and I'm sure nobody had a harder time to
                              get on to the stage than she did; and you're more like her than any one else—all you
                              girls are. There's little Mary, she'll make the best play-actress among you yet; what
                              will you do for a dress?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1887">"I know," replied the daughter. "I can sew that spangled trimming I once made on to
                              my white satin dress. I made it on foundation, you know, that I might be able to transfer
                              it from one dress to another. We actresses," she added, feeling herself the stage-charm
                              she had once condemned as affectation in others, "call it faking."

                           <p id="d58070e1890">Gail could not sleep that night. She underwent all the fever, the pain, the joy of
                              her soul's birth<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="59" data-tei-n="116-117"> </a></span> into a new state of existence. In our monotonous daily life, we change so slowly,
                              that we do not feel ourselves grow; but with Gail, quickened by the longed-for event,
                              it was the start of a new life. She saw her old self almost as the butterfly might
                              look upon the larva as no part of her being.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1895">She had now a purpose—something to hold her mind above the petty jealousies and vanities
                              of the theatre. She already experienced its vitalizing influence. She felt broad and
                              generous impulses. Her new soul, out of its abundance, was ready to give. Her genius,
                              too, seemed to have developed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1898">The part revealed itself to her. She did not model her ideal of the character, holding
                              it at will to assume or to set aside. It was rather the part that took possession
                              of her. The conception of it that had long ago dawned in her brain expanded itself
                              in the warmth of her new impetus, till it filled every thought, nerve, vein, and muscle
                              of her being. She felt awaken in herself the sympathies of the frank, earnest character
                              of Juliet. She realized the passion of love. The very destiny of Juliet was for the
                              time the foreshadowing of her own. At the rehearsal on the following morning, Gail
                              had become so absorbed in her study, that she was hardly aware of what was passing
                              around her. The ballet made cutting remarks, and the actors and actresses were far
                              too conspicuously indifferent. Mrs. Sands alone greeted her in her usual manner.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1902">"Do you go hon for the part, my dear?" she said. "It's 'eavy business for a beginner,
                              though it's not so 'eavy as what I 'ad to do myself. I went on for Lady Mac, and I
                              wasn't in your years neither." This last remark savored of truth, as Mrs. Sands was
                              considerably older than Gail at the specified time, when she played Lady Macbeth at
                              a town hall with a company of rather verdant aspirants for histrionic fame.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1905">As the rehearsal proceeded, however, the actors and actresses began covertly to watch
                              her performance with something besides indifference, or assumed indifference. The
                              new sensation was, perhaps, rather excitement than approval, and partook a little
                              of the feeling with which one watches a gathering storm that one must admire and dread
                              at the same time. When not on the stage, Gail sought the most retired spot behind
                              the scenes, that she might record the business she would have to remember at night,
                              and prepare her mind for the next scene. While she was occupied in this way, a sentence,
                              uttered by a voice close at hand, startled her for an instant from her ideal surroundings.
                              The speaker was concealed from her by a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="60" data-tei-n="118-119"> </a></span> huge wing; but the voice sounded distinctly in her ear. "What do you think of the
                              new actress?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1910">A slight flush overspread Gail's face.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1913">"Who do you mean?" was the answer. "Lennox's new favorite?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1916">The flush in Gail's face deepened painfully.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1919">"She 
                              <emph id="d58070e1921">his</emph> favorite? 
                              <emph id="d58070e1924">He's</emph> the favorite, I should think. She follows him about like a little kitten—the fool."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1929">Gail became indignant.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1932">"You may well say fool," answered the second speaker. "I declare, when I see any one
                              behave like that, I want to shake them. He means to engage her here next season—doesn't
                              he? What does she do, I wonder? Good business?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1935">"I don't know, or care, as far as I am concerned," replied her companion. "I never
                              was in such a theatre before. They don't care 
                              <emph id="d58070e1937">that</emph> what the public wants. Everything goes by favoritism. Lennox and one or two of the
                              big ones have it all their own way. You can't get a respectable actress to stay here.
                              They say they won't play where a theatre has the reputation this one has."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1941">"It is just like all theatres," put in a voice Gail well knew. "I never saw an actress
                              yet that didn't say there never was a theatre so bad as the one she happens to be
                              at and not up in."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1944">"O, you shut up, Bell! No one can say boo but that you snap at them."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1947">"You must own," replied the irrepressible Bell, "that she is very beautiful."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1951">"They must mean some one else," whispered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1954">"Well, prettyish," was the answer; "but it's not a face that strikes me at all."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1957">"I was wrong; it is me," again thought Gail. At this moment the prompter's call sounded
                              for Juliet to be ready, and Gail strove to shake off the odd mingling of elation and
                              annoyance that had taken possession of her. On her way to the stage she met the manager,
                              for the first time that morning, face to face. Until now he had manifested little
                              or no interest in her trial, and had hardly seemed to be aware of her presence in
                              the theatre; but now he approached her familiarly, and, putting his arm around her
                              shoulder, murmured some compliment in her ear. With the petty suspicions uppermost
                              in her mind, she repulsed him with decision, and then stood for a moment a little
                              scared, for she remembered Lennox's hint, that her appearance depended on his pleasure
                              as well as on her success. But it was only for a moment. The integrity of her character
                              asserted itself. She colored with shame, and resolved to win by her ability<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="61" data-tei-n="120-121"> </a></span> ity alone. She turned her mind again to her part, and proceeded to rehearse with
                              renewed power and interest. On her exit, Gail observed that the ladies had issued
                              from their place of concealment, and were promenading the side stage. Presently they
                              were joined by a pretty little figure, the fascination of whose presence caused Gail
                              to scan the face with attention. It was like a strain of music, and recalled the past.
                              Gail strove to think where she had seen it, and remembered suddenly the old legend
                              of the princess. She had not chanced to see the princess for a number of years; but
                              this face had in it the pretty child's expression she used to watch from a distance,
                              only it was more beautiful than even the picture she had once carried in her mind.
                              The ladies welcomed the princess. She seemed to be a favorite among them. There were
                              no tears in the beautiful eyes, as there had been when Jenny had seen them. They were
                              merry with smiles.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1962">"What are you laughing at, Julie?" inquired one of the ladies. "You seem to be very
                              much amused."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1965">"Good reason for it," cried the beauty, saucily. "What do you think? That man wanted
                              to kiss me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1968">"What man do you mean, Seely? I'd have boxed his ears."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1972">"Seely! O, good gracious, no!" laughed Julie, mimicking the prompter. "Your manager,
                              there. Lennox you call him."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1975">"O, Tom Lennox! Well, why didn't you let him?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1978">"I thought I'd rather be excised," said Julie, demurely. The next moment she added,
                              "O, hush! He's here!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1981">Gail raised her eyes, and caught an expression in Julie's face that touched her. The
                              child was evidently not so bold as she wished to appear. It was a struggle between
                              her vanity and some better instinct. The manager advanced to the little party, and,
                              glancing at Gail, triumphantly embraced Julie. "You are a very pretty girl," he whispered
                              to her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1984">"I know it," said Julie, archly, but not without blushing.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1987">"You know it, eh!" replied the manager. "You are a coquette."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1991">"She says you wanted to kiss her," put in one of the ladies, mischievously.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1994">Julie's blushing face glanced at her, beseechingly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e1997">"Well, I do now," said the manager, looking poor Julie out of countenance with his
                              bold, handsome eyes.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e2002">"O, but you mustn't. It would be wicked—wouldn't it?" cried Julie, a little alarmed,
                              and trying to disengage herself from the manager's embrace.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2005">"Now you are unkind," said the manager, "and a naughty girl besides."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2009">"Don't call names, sir, if you please," replied Julie, pouting. "If I'm a naughty
                              girl, you'd better go away. People don't like to stay where other people are naughty,
                              I should hope."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2012">"Don't they, though?" said the manager, with a laugh. "Now I've half an idea they
                              do, some of them."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2015">Gail had changed her place; she stood where she could not see the speakers, but their
                              voices were still audible.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2018">There was a silence; and when the manager next spoke, something in his tone sent the
                              blood cold to her heart, and caused her a sickening sensation. She judged, by this
                              altered tone, that he and Julie were alone. His manner had no longer the careless
                              gayety of one half in joke. "What do you do all day long, my darling?" he whispered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2021">"All day is a long time; I couldn't say," was Julie's answer. There was a change in
                              her voice also. She spoke as if her heart beat far too fast.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2024">"Come up and see me," said the manager, still lowering his voice. "Won't you? Come.
                              I'm deuced lonely sometimes, and I like to see your pretty, merry face."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2028">Julie was, like a poor charmed bird, fascinated and frightened at the same moment.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2031">I don't know whether I'll come or not," she said. "You mustn't talk that way to me
                              any more."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2034">"What way?" said the manager, laughing, and drawing Julie more closely to him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2037">"Why, you know, like 
                              <emph id="d58070e2039">that;</emph>" said Julie. "You frighten me, and it's wrong to frighten people."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2043">"You needn't be frightened, my child," said the manager, so tenderly that poor Julie
                              broke down.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2046">"You—you'll—make me fall in love with you, if you d—d—don't take care," she half sobbed;
                              "and that would be dreadful; you—you know it would."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2050">"Nonsense, my dear; don't," said the manager, somewhat hurriedly. "Why, what could
                              a pretty little girl like you see to take a fancy to in an old fellow like me? Come,
                              run along home now, darling;" and he added, somewhat lower, "Come here again to-night,
                              and I'll walk home with you. It's a long distance for such a pretty girl as you to
                              walk alone."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e2055">Gail's face flushed and grew cold by turns. She felt an inclination to draw away from
                              the seemingly light being who threatened to displace her old pure image of the princess,
                              even while she longed to excuse, protect, and defend Julie. She would like to have
                              stolen out of the wing unseen, but Lennox evidently stood where Julie had left him;
                              for Gail presently heard the harsh voice of Mrs. Sands address him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2058">"For shame, Lenny!" she cried. "You're turning that poor child's 'ed with your fine
                              talk. She 'ain't been brought up in the profession, and she'll believe anything."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2061">"Well, I don't mean to hurt her, Mrs. Sands," said the manager, more thoughtfully
                              than he had yet spoken.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2064">"That's the way you men always talk," laughed Mrs. Sands. "But you're gay deceivers,
                              the 'ole lot of you. I know you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2068">The manager laughed also, but his answer showed some disquietude.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2071">"You're not very complimentary to a fellow, Meary," he said. "One would think we were
                              a d—d mean set."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2074">"Well, now, mind you, Lenny," cried the ballet mistress, "you mustn't mind me. I don't
                              mean the 'alf of what I say, nor yet the quarter; and me and you 'as known each other
                              long enough not to quarrel, I should 'ope. You've a good 'eart, Lenny, and there's
                              no 'arm in being a little gay. I honly wish it was as heasy to be 'appy."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2077">It was drawing near the time for Juliet to take the sleeping potion. Gail had placed
                              her chief dependence on this scene. She had the stage, and could give her undivided
                              attention to it. She wished again to banish from her mind all disturbing causes. For
                              this purpose she repaired to the dressing-room, and in solitude rehearsed the scene.
                              When she descended she was prepared. To actresses of experience the ordeal Gail was
                              about to undergo would have been a severe one, and far more trying than a debut before
                              an audience. It is not the habit of players to 
                              <emph id="d58070e2079">act</emph> at rehearsals; and any display of histrionic ability at such a time appears to them
                              novice-like. She had, moreover, none of the hothouse stimulus to genius—the lights,
                              the excitement, the applause, and the living picture that surrounds the debutante
                              in the scenes, events, and other characters of the piece. But to a mind like Gail's
                              these things were of little moment. She hardly observed the groups of actors and carpenters
                              that filled up the lower entrances. Nor was she disturbed by the noise and talking.
                              She stood for one moment as if summoning<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="64" data-tei-n="126-127"> </a></span> the scene before her. There was a hush in the wings.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2085">On the stage Juliet reached out her hands to the nurse imploringly, despairingly,
                              then forced herself into courage. She moved to the centre of the stage, and fixed
                              her eyes on the vial in her hand. Already some subtile, invisible current from the
                              potent draught seemed to creep through her veins, freeze the blood in her heart, and
                              draw the color from her cheek. Pale as death, with glazed, absent eyes, a voice, low
                              and appalled, she uttered, one by one, her fearful surmises. It seemed not that she
                              conjured up the ghastly picture of the tomb, with all its sickening images, but rather
                              that it forced itself upon her, holding her spell-bound, like one in a dream.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2088">She is motionless—transfixed with horror—till the last frenzied climax, when, with
                              the weak, desperate effort and the shuddering scream of the dreamer, she cries, "Stay,
                              Tybalt, stay! Romeo, I come! This do I drink to thee." The effect of this scene, thus
                              powerfully rendered, was electrical. Before, they had had time to reason or criticise,
                              Gail's little audience was surprised into applause. But, nevertheless, the trial over,
                              here is what followed:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2092">"By George," said one of the scene-shifters "that's real life. We haven't had anything
                              in the make-believe line that's taken hold of me so since I've knocked about a theatre,
                              and that's twenty year."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2095">"She'll 
                              <emph id="d58070e2097">do,</emph>" said a companion.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2101">"Amen," said Isabel Lester, emphatically; and she glanced with malicious triumph into
                              the faces about. There was a silence.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2104">"She'd do in a drawing-room," said Tybalt; "but she'd hardly tell before an audience."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2107">"The girl don't read bad," said Paris; "but I can't say much for her elocution."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2110">"Her business is fearfully stiff," put in Lady Capulet.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2114">"Why, for God's sake, don't some one tell her the business of the piece, if she's
                              new to the stage?" said Tybalt.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2117">"How quick one can tell a novice!" said Lady Capulet. "Did you ever see Mrs. Reems
                              play the part? She was immense as Juliet—perfectly immense!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2120">"She didn't believe acting could be learned in a day," sighed the Nurse. "She was
                              forty years old before she ever went on for the part. I knew her. I played with her
                              myself in the old country. She was then in the juvenile business, and I was playing
                              children."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="65" data-tei-n="128-129"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2125">"Were you, indeed?" said Lady Capulet. "It doesn't seem as if poor Reemsy could have
                              been old enough for the juvenile business at that time." Lady C. inwardly thought
                              that it didn't seem as if poor Nursy could have been young enough for the children.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2128">"Managers are not what they used to be," continued the Nurse. "It is enough now to
                              have a fine figure and a good dress to play Juliet. Then we had to undergo a thorough
                              schooling."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2132">"It is astonishing, though," said Friar Laurence, "how unerringly the instincts of
                              genius hit at the right mark. Here is this young girl, possessed of native talent,
                              but wholly new to the stage, not only touching all our hearts,—old stagers that we
                              are,—but managing her voice and power with so much discretion and sense, that she
                              at all times sustains the part, and is heard in any part of the house. I have watched
                              some of her scenes myself, from front."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2135">If the Nurse had been an argumentative character, she would have said, "Your theory
                              leaves an actress no room for improvement;" but not being so, she replied, "Ah! do
                              you think so, indeed?" with a faint smile. And the friar felt he had clenched the
                              matter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2138">"Is the lady new to the stage?" inquired Mrs. Hazledean.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2141">"Quite new," replied Lady Capulet. "I think it is 
                              <emph id="d58070e2143">quite</emph> apparent."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2147">"I hadn't noticed till now," replied Mrs. Hazledean, with a little flush. In truth,
                              the Romeo of the morning had only indicated the consciousness of his Juliet's presence
                              at such times as they should have been in contact, and then only by murmuring, "Now,
                              then, here's where the embrace comes in;" "Now we have the business of the balcony;"
                              or, "The other side, if you please, my dear."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2150">On the stage, Mercutio, who did not rejoice in any great reputation for gentlemanly
                              manners, seized the vial, at the close of Juliet's scene. "Don't throw your arm up
                              like that, madam," he said; "you're not drinking a toast. You want to speak out freer,
                              too, and have more ease and motion, and not stand like a stick, as if there were but
                              one spot on the stage. By George, you all do it, though, you novices. One would think
                              you had never seen your own arms or legs before, you know so little what to do with
                              them."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2154">"Your idea of the scene is different from mine," answered Gail, suddenly freezing
                              from the languid, sunny warmth she had begun to feel after her effort, and in the
                              consciousness of her success. "It does not seem to me so natural to—"
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="66" data-tei-n="130-131"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2159">"All right," interrupted Mercutio, with marked impatience; "if you know too much to
                              learn!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2162">"I don't consider—" began Gail again.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2165">"Any time you can let us have the stage, between now and nightfall," put in the prompter,
                              with mild-spoken sarcasm, "we shall be obliged. Don't inconvenience yourself, though.
                              The ladies happen to be waiting to go on with their scene—that's all!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2168">Gail retired, without, however, apologizing. The sarcasm of the prompter did not strike
                              her as necessary.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2172">On her exit she was received in a manner rather more flattering. Mr. Lennox, and two
                              gentlemen outsiders who had been pouring their enthusiasm into his ear, stood ready
                              to welcome her. "Bravo! bravo! bravo!" said the manager, clapping his hands gently.
                              "Bravo!" echoed the other gentlemen.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2175">"We'll make an actress of you yet," continued the manager. "You show great promise."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2178">"You are satisfied with me, then?" said Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2181">"Yes, yes!" answered the manager. "You do as well as that to-night, and you'll bring
                              down the house."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2184">"I congratulate myself that I shall be present at the debut of one destined to become
                              one of our brightest stars," said one of the gentlemen, blushing slightly. He was
                              quite young, wore eye-glasses, had the air of a student, and, in the place, very much
                              the appearance of a fish out of water.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2187">Gail bowed.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2191">"He means what he says," said the other gentleman, who was considerably older, and
                              one of those stout persons one invariably meets in the vicinity of the turf, in the
                              frailest of vehicles,—the man and carriage reminding one of a fat-bodied spider on
                              slender legs. "You beat the others all—Tom, you ought to herald the lady's debut with
                              something besides an announcement. He don't make the most of his good luck—does he,
                              my dear?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2194">Gail shrank under the gaze of this man, that was even more wanting in respect than
                              the manager's.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2197">"All that will come in time," answered Lennox, prudently. "One must creep before they
                              can run, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2200">"You will not be frightened, my child?" to Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2203">"No, sir."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2206">"Well, my dear, I shall expect you to-night."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2210">"Thank you." Gail could say no more, though the manager's words gave her a thrill.
                              Still she<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="67" data-tei-n="132-133"> </a></span> was not surprised. She had lived all her life in this one dream, and she had lived
                              so much in the event, that she was at home in the new state of things. Moreover, the
                              realization of the dream brings with it care that is 
                              <emph id="d58070e2214">not</emph> dreamed of, and that seasons the dream with a little real life.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2218">Gail's new life opened to her rather as an intense interest, than a joy. We might
                              say 
                              <emph id="d58070e2220">lives,</emph> for she lived also in the character she was about to personate, and it would be hard
                              to say which was the greater romance of the two, Juliet or the new Abigail.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2224">On her way home from the rehearsal, Gail stopped, and said to herself, with a sort
                              of ecstasy, "Now I am sure," and fell to fancying all the happy possibilities that
                              might ensue from her debut. At her own door she paused, with a smile. "I wonder if
                              they can tell by my face," she thought, "whether I'm to play or not. I mean to look
                              sober, and make them guess;" to which end she pushed the door open softly, and stole
                              in upon the family. She found her mother, however, and her three sisters in a great
                              bustle of excitement, surrounded by ribbons, laces, and all manner of stage finery.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2227">"Hush!" cried Jennie Hart, as Gail entered. "I wonder if she'll notice."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2230">On the table were two lovely roses, fresh as a June morning; one red, and the other
                              white.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2233">"What exquisite flowers!" said Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2237">"She noticed them first thing!" cried Jennie, triumphantly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2240">"Well, you put them right in plain sight there, mounted up on my cake-basket; so no
                              wonder," said Mrs. Hart.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2243">"They're for you to wear to-night in the ball-room scene," continued Jennie, jumping
                              about the room in her delight. "That red one's mother's present to you, and the white
                              one's father's."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2246">"How do you know there is to be any ball-room scene?" said Gail. "Perhaps I failed,
                              and—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2249">"And perhaps you didn't," interrupted Jennie. "That frown isn't near big enough to
                              cover a big smile I see underneath. O, you goose! I wonder the manager don't put you
                              into babies' parts, you're such a poor actress. Say, though, it 
                              <emph id="d58070e2251">is</emph> all right—isn't it?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2255">"Yes, yes," said Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2259">"You must keep up good pluck, daughter," said Gail's father, with a beaming smile.
                              "Ma and I and the girls will be right on hand to cheer you. We've got first-rate seats;
                              so you must look out for the applause."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2262">"Pa, dear," said Gail, something causing the quick tears to start in her eyes, "I
                              shan't hear any other hands clap but yours."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="68" data-tei-n="134-135"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2267">"I'm sure, Gail, 
                              <emph id="d58070e2269">I hope you will,</emph>" said Jennie, turning it off as a joke. "It would be rather embarrassing if pa was
                              the only one who applauded."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2273">But Gail did not smile; her face was bent thoughtfully over the flowers. She touched
                              the white rose with reverence, and whispered over it some mysterious words. "This
                              shall be my talisman. When I forget the trust you have in me, you dearest of fathers,
                              and most noble of men, I shall 
                              <emph id="d58070e2275">deserve</emph> not to succeed. I will always keep my home in my mind, while I am at the theatre."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2279">"I'm sure I'm thankful you've come home, Abby," said Mrs. Hart, whose face was much
                              flushed. "I've been in such a state of hurry, that I don't know what to do. I'm afraid
                              that we shan't have things in readiness."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2283">"We shan't want to have all these things in readiness, as ma calls it," laughed Jennie.
                              "Just look; we've hauled down about everything in the house in case of need. You see
                              it's rather a dangerous thing having people about that are liable, with no notice
                              whatever, to be 'cast up.'"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2286">"Or cast down, perhaps," intimated her sister.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2289">"Hush, children; you confuse me," said Mrs. Hart. "It's about my bonnets I'm puzzling.
                              I don't know which to wear. Your father says, wear the one that suits me best; but
                              then men don't know what they're talking about, in such matters, half the time."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2292">"Wear the green," suggested Gail, abstractedly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2295">"Green? What green?" said Mrs. Hart, musingly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2298">"I would say your black lace bonnet," said Gail, rousing herself.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2302">"Well, I must wear that or something," responded Mrs. Hart.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2305">"Why, yes," put in Jennie. "It does seem necessary."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2308">"I suppose, as your father and mother," continued Mrs. Hart, "pa and I will be taken
                              considerable notice of, and the girls, too. I do hope they won't go to putting on
                              bonnets, and making themselves look as old as the hills; when, too,"—went on the mother,
                              addressing herself to her younger daughters, probably in continuation of some recent
                              discussion,—"when, too, all the Beacon Street ladies wear little simple hats, and
                              make themselves look like just what they are—little children. I mean, of course—make
                              you look like what you are, and not like grannies, or little dried-up nimshies."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2311">"If you happen to see a little dried-up nimshy in the audience, Gail," said Jennie,
                              merrily, "you may know it's me; for I feel as though I must<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="69" data-tei-n="136-137"> </a></span> wear my best white bonnet, trimmed with scarlet flowers."

                           <p id="d58070e2316">"Do come here, Gail," said the mother, squinting up her eyes to scan her daughter's
                              face. "Seems to me you're all broke out with some kind of rash."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2319">"Why, no, she isn't, ma," cried one of the younger girls. "You are always saying something
                              to scare people, just when they naturally want to look nice."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2323">"I hope you are not going to have the measles," continued Mrs. Hart, "just at this
                              most particular time, when everything depends upon you. I should give up; but I suppose
                              Jennie could play the part. Now, if she'd only studied it up, in case of—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2326">"It's nothing, mother," interrupted Gail, inwardly hoping that she might look sufficiently
                              pale by night for the interesting Juliet. "The stage was cold, and I got excited over
                              my part, and then coming into this warm room here—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2329">"Excited!" exclaimed Mrs. Hart. "Gail, you're no play-actress at all. I've heard say
                              Fanny Kemble would be acting the greatest part, and turn right round and say the most
                              commonplace thing to some of the other play-actors. I suppose now, if I'd gone on
                              to the stage when I was a girl, I should have made as great an actress as Mrs. Siddons
                              by this time. Your father says I would," emphasized Mrs. Hart, in defiance of a rising
                              smile on the countenances of her younger daughters. "For if ever there's a fire or
                              a robbery, I'm always quiet and collected; and there was Susan Wilson—she wanted to
                              scream if only the dinner pot boiled over, I was going to say."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2332">"The talent for acting is not confined to one particular temperament, mother," said
                              Gail.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2335">"That's just what I said," replied Mrs. Hart, "and what I've been telling you all
                              along; and now, Gail, what I do hope is, that you'll come right out on the stage,
                              the very first thing, and speak up tragic, flourish around some, and show them what
                              you can do."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2338">At night Gail repaired to the theatre somewhat earlier than was necessary. There was
                              no sign of life in the auditory, and not even a stray workman behind the scenes. She
                              remembered, the first night she had crossed the stage, how different it had seemed.
                              Then the excitement was all without; now it was within; and yet everything about her
                              was charged with the magnetism of her good fortune. Being an actress meant so much
                              to Gail. It made of her life a romance; and now that she had tested her own power,
                              and felt the foreshadowing<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="70" data-tei-n="138-139"> </a></span> ing of her own success, it took yet deeper hold of her. She entered her dressing-room,
                              and was a little startled to find it dark. She had not forgotten that it was an off
                              night; but it had not occurred to her that on that account the usual noisy throng
                              would be absent.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2344">For an instant an odd sort of a little panic took possession of her. She produced
                              a light, and referred to a programme she had brought with her to assure herself that
                              there could be no mistake in the date. It seemed strange that on this eventful night
                              there should be no stir and excitement. The light revealed the empty dressing-places,
                              soiled dresses, and bits of dirty tinsel and tarletan left on them by the ladies.
                              All the brightness and glamor of the old show-piece seemed to have burned itself down
                              to this last charred, smoky, sickening litter. Gail wondered she could have endured
                              so long the hunger and discouragement of her old position.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2347">The confident, dignified woman, whose face was beautified by the soul's development,
                              was indeed a contrast to the nervous, irritable girl, starved on morbid fancies, She
                              stood before the glass in all the pride of this new dignity, with the fresh enthusiasm
                              of youth flushing her face, as handsome a Juliet as ever appeared upon the stage.
                              Her beauty was like a garnet; it needed the light of good fortune to bring out its-depth
                              and richness, as the jewel needs the sunshine. To-night her black eyes shone with
                              a starry brilliancy. The soft lace of her dress reposed on a bosom as white as itself,
                              and her dark hair contrasted with her-snowy forehead. She possessed one advantage
                              for the stage, the value of which, as yet, she did not know—a perfectly-modelled figure.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2350">Having prepared the image of Juliet, she began pacing the room and rehearsing her
                              part, that she might put the soul into it. There was a soft knock at the door. "The
                              call-boy," thought Gail, "come to call the act;" and she experienced a slight palpitation
                              of the heart.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2353">"Is Miss—er—Hart within?" inquired the gentle voice of the prompter outside.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2356">Gail stepped to the door.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2359">"Ah, Miss Hart—is it?" said the prompter, with a step back, as if the apparition startled
                              him, for some reason. Gail answered, "Yes."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2363">"I came up to inform you," continued the prompter, his eyes seeking the floor, "that
                              we needn't trouble you to go on for the part. Miss Ceelems has so far recovered from
                              her illness that she decides to appear. I was in hopes to see you before you dressed;
                              but I see you are ahead of me. You are quite early, my dear; the half hour<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="71" data-tei-n="140-141"> </a></span> is not yet called." The prompter added this gently, but still not without sarcasm;
                              for to be too early was novice-like. "I am sorry to have troubled you. There is nothing
                              more; good night."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2368">The prompter stole down stairs on tiptoe, and Gail still stood as she had first met
                              him, with her head bent, and the door knob in her hand. When at last the crushed soul
                              raised itself painfully and laboriously into half-consciousness, she closed the door,
                              returned to her dressing-place, and began slowly turning over the leaves of her play.
                              Then she raised her face quickly to the glass, and paused. Her lips pressed themselves
                              together tightly; but there were no tears. She began removing the ornaments from her
                              dress hurriedly, looking, by force of habit, into the glass the while. She did not
                              once see the white, stricken face on which her eyes were fixed. Her every motion,
                              sure in its aim, but painfully forced, had a sad significance. It showed how little
                              strength the will had to lift even so light a hand, that must keep in check a torrent
                              of passion. She had been thrown from her dizzy height, remorselessly, into the abyss
                              of a bitter, bitter disappointment. The passions that Gail could summon at will were
                              her familiars, and in turn held over her their sway. In the darkness of her soul,
                              those who had insulted her appeared like demons, triumphing in her downfall.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2371">With every nerve quivering with pain, she opposed them proudly, and strove to shield
                              herself from them by a poor, pitiful, mock indifference. She tried to arrange each
                              little thing in the order it should be for conveying home, lest any trivial mistake
                              should reveal to these imaginary eyes that she was not mistress of herself; but her
                              little hands trembled over their task. Her lips were hot, and she struggled constantly
                              to choke down a great ache in her throat that was intolerable. She had had no consciousness
                              of each separate act, till her hand came upon the roses in her bosom. The touch was
                              like a kind word. She bent her face over the roses and cried. Dear hearts would be
                              sad for her, and dear faces pale and sorrowful, that had been made so bright by her
                              happiness. Something like a flash of lightning, sharp and sudden, blinded her for
                              an instant, and left her trembling from head to foot. She sprang forward and clasped
                              her hands fiercely. It was a moment of agony. Then she flung herself down upon her
                              knees with an angry, helpless cry, buried her face in her hands, and sobbed. All was
                              over—all but the pain, the sorrow, the astonishment, and indignation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2374">A few notes of the overture struck upon her ears, and she started up pale and shivering
                              with a new terror. She must escape from the theatre before<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="142-143"> </a></span> the piece should begin, that no curious eye might see her wretchedness. She finished
                              her task desperately, and stole down stairs with a strange mingling of dread and defiance.
                              If the manager had seen the royal beauty of half an hour ago, it is possible he would
                              have let his admiration overcome his prudence, and his fear of offending his leading
                              lady, and Gail would have appeared; but if he had seen the bowed figure in its old
                              shawl, and with its heavy bundle, unhappy face, and red eyes, it is more than possible
                              he would have looked another way, and pretended he saw nothing of the sort.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2379">Gail hurried blindly across the stage and out into the street. For some moments she
                              walked rapidly. Then she slackened her pace, in dread of meeting the loved ones at
                              home. There was both shame and love in this timidity. It is hard to own to ourselves
                              that we are considered nobody, and harder still to confess it to those whose love
                              for us makes them almost as blind as we ourselves are. Gail made an effort to fortify
                              herself for the ordeal, and again quickened her steps. She had not gone many rods,
                              when the voice of Isabel Lester hailed her. She drew back, and in secret wrung her
                              hands. She did not want her wound touched, even in sympathy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2382">"I have been following you," said Isabel, bluntly. "I knew you would be disappointed
                              because they took away the part. They're a mean set."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2386">Gail could not command herself sufficiently to respond, and the two women walked on
                              some paces without speaking.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2389">"You might know," said Isabel, at last, jerking herself out of the silence that was
                              growing awkward, "that such a modest little thing as you—though, by the by, you're
                              not so very small—would be imposed upon. Lennox only put you up because he knew the
                              other woman was in a jealous tiff, and that as soon as she found some one in her place,
                              she'd come out of it quick enough."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2392">Gail's eyes flashed, but she did not trust herself to speak, lest Isabel should discover
                              she had been crying.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2395">"I'll give you a little information free gratis," continued Isabel, with a sort of
                              dry sharpness, "in case you ever try to get on to the stage again. Managers are only
                              to be caught in their own trap—a brazen exterior, and such loud-lettered advertisement
                              of yourself that a fast man may read them as he runs. The theatre is just like the
                              caldron in Macbeth. Not much good gets into it, and only the scum rises. You know,
                              as a general thing, what is light floats uppermost, and flippant people get on swimmingly,
                              while weightier characters sink."

                              to be governed by her own bitterness, endeavored to lift her mind from its misery,
                              and force herself to think impartially. Her poor little bit of philosophy found its
                              way through lips that could scarcely steady themselves to speak. "There are facts
                              that have a different story to tell. There are truly great actors and actresses on
                              the stage. Then, it is but natural we must speak loud to be heard in a world where
                              so much is going on. Because I have to condemn a few, I don't want to judge all harshly.
                              My interest is a small thing in itself; but if I hold it too near my mind's eye, it
                              can hide the world."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2404">"Why, you've been crying!" said Isabel, quick to detect the emotion in Gail's voice.
                              "I wouldn't mind it. Come to my house some day, and we'll look over the New York papers.
                              There are lots of theatrical advertisements in them, and who knows but that something
                              may come of it?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2407">Gail's heart sickened. It was the old painful subject, only made ghastly; for to her
                              it had been dead, and was now, so to speak, rising from its grave. She thanked Isabel
                              wearily; and, as they had reached Gail's house, Isabel bade her good night, with characteristic
                              abruptness.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2410">Gail dragged herself into the hall, and stood leaning her throbbing temples against
                              the cool plaster, striving to press back the hot tears, that she might meet her family
                              in a more courageous manner. She had not long to wait, for Mr. and Mrs. Hart left
                              the theatre immediately on the rising of the curtain. But when the door opened and
                              they stood before her, she dared not raise her eyes to meet her father's face. She
                              could not have borne to see the pained look that tried to be cheerful. To feel that
                              it was written there, made her heart ache anew.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2413">The poor mother made no effort to conceal her indignation. "If I'd been you, Gail,
                              I'd gone right on, in spite of them, and played the part. Every play-actress has to
                              do that, if she wants to get along. I declare, when I saw that other woman coming
                              on in your place, I thought you had let them come it over you with some of their tricks;
                              and I wanted to get hold of you so, that I didn't know what to do."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2416">Gail shuddered, and thought of a distasteful farce, in which two Juliets appear, and
                              a ranting burlesque ensues.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2419">"Never mind, Abigail," said her father, his voice becoming unsteady as he spoke; "you
                              shall have a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="74" data-tei-n="146-147"> </a></span> theatre here at home, and your mother and I will see you play."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2425">Gail began to sob as this homely balm touched her wound. She longed to say how the
                              whole world's applause could never be so precious to her as the appreciation of that
                              one loving, noble spirit; but she could not control herself to speak words so near
                              her heart. She could only sob out, "I—I don't mind it much. I'm a little overtasked
                              just now; but I don't care for it. I don't know why I cry about it. I am sure I didn't
                              mean to. It's so much learned, if there's nothing gained. So don't let's think any
                              more about it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2428">"That's the best way," said her father.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2431">"Can't anything be done, father," asked Mrs. Hart, "to make those stage managers feel
                              how meanly they've acted towards our Gail?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2434">"Never mind it now, mother," pleaded Gail, pressing her hands tightly together under
                              her shawl, as if to draw the pain from her heart. "Come, Jennie, let's you and I go
                              to bed. We'll feel more jolly in the morning, I dare say, and I won't act quite so
                              silly."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2437">Jennie, who had been walking up and down the room, with a strange bright light in
                              her eyes, very different from the trouble in the faces of the others, came quickly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2440">"We shan't need any light to-night," continued Gail, anxious to conceal the emotion
                              she could not suppress.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2444">"No," replied Jennie.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2447">The sisters crept into bed in the dark, and the night wore on. Gail lay still, pretending
                              to be asleep; but she was feverish, and her brain throbbed unceasingly under her closed
                              lids. Nor could Jennie have been asleep, for her wide-open blue eyes looked towards
                              the window at the stars. Once she passed her hand gently across her sister's face.
                              There were fresh tears in the eyes, and the lips were parched.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2450">"Asleep, Gail?" she whispered.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2453">"Not just now, Jennie," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2456">Jennie was quiet. She was still doubtful.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2459">By and by she repeated her inquiry more hopefully.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2463">Gail, without moving, replied as before.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2466">"I've thought what we can do, Gail," cried Jennie, rising up in bed to clap her hands
                              exultingly. "We can hire a theatre. You get together all your favorite plays, and
                              practise them up."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2469">"Go to sleep, Jennie," replied Gail, trying to smile; "or rather, wake up. You're
                              dreaming, and that makes the thing seem reasonable to you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2472">"No such thing," said Jennie, emphatically.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="75" data-tei-n="148-149"> </a></span> "I've planned everything out in my own mind, and I know just what to do; only, of
                              course, it will take time. But no matter—you'll see. I'd rather have got things all
                              ready, and made the scheme speak for itself. But I thought I'd say a little about
                              it to-night, to comfort you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2477">Gail drew Jennie's hand to her lips, and kissed it; and the sisters said no more until
                              morning.

                           <p id="d58070e2489">MISS FANNY CEELEMS stood before the glass dressing for Juliet. Mrs. H. D. Leamingston
                              and Mrs. Maria Latell were occupied in the same manner, for the respective rôles of
                              the Nurse and Lady Capulet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2492">Miss Digby, the dresser, was in attendance.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2495">"What takes my fancy," said Miss Ceelems, haughtily, "is the impertinence of the thing.
                              Would you believe it, they say she came up here to the theatre, and dressed for the
                              part—actually dressed for the part. My God!"—N. B. This expression is uttered by the
                              ladies of the theatre rather as a light ejaculation of astonishment, than as an oath.—"I
                              never was so treated before. I suppose some one will be asking for my eyes next."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2499">"Or your hand, my dear, and your heart," responded the Nurse, wittily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2502">"Dear! dear! dear! My senses, will you hear that woman talk?" murmured Miss Ceelems.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2505">"What did Lennox say for himself, my dear?" inquired Lady Capulet.</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="76" data-tei-n="150-151"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2510">Miss Ceelems smiled aside with secret satisfaction, but answered in the same tone.
                              "O, he apologized; said he judged by my note to a certain brute—who shall be nameless—that
                              I would not be able to rehearse, and that he hadn't any intention of letting the girl
                              do more than go on in the morning, and 
                              <emph id="d58070e2512">that</emph> only to gratify her. It seems she is ambitious for the profession. A ballet girl!
                              The idea! She teased Lennox into letting her rehearse, as she said, by way of a little
                              practice. Poor Tommy can't say no. You know he's as tender-hearted as a baby."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2516">"Poor Tommy 
                              <emph id="d58070e2518">can</emph> say no when he has a mind to," muttered the dresser aside. She had entertained desires
                              concerning the stage herself, and probably knew.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2523">"The whole affair was a ridiculous farce from beginning to end," drawled Lady Capulet.
                              "I reelly felt for the poor geirl. She tried hard; but you know what the part is,
                              and what the stage is. It was fearful: in the first place, she couldn't be heard two
                              feet off; and then she had stage fright, so that Seely had to give her the word constantly;
                              and to cap the climax, she comes up at night to play."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2526">"Stage fright at rehearsal! Well, well," said Miss Ceelems, laughing.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2529">"O, now, my dears, you shouldn't speak like that; you know she's a novice," replied
                              Lady Capulet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2532">"And that will account for any crime short of murder," thought Miss Digby.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2535">Miss Ceelems contemplated the lovely picture in the glass before her, and sighed luxuriously.
                              "If a woman knows what's good for herself, she'll keep out of the profession. You
                              do not know, my dears, how I pine for the seclusion of private life; all this glitter
                              and vanity palls upon the senses; but, then, the public, my dear, you know, the public!"

                           <p id="d58070e2538">The Nurse and Lady Capulet sighed also, and intimated their acquaintance with the
                              public.

                           <p id="d58070e2542">Miss Ceelems powdered her face complacently. "And so, after making a total failure,
                              she would have gone on at night, in Shakespeare, too! Well, the blind conceit of some
                              people is refreshing. If it wasn't for the ridiculousness of it, I should be half
                              inclined to be angry."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2545">"Well, now, I don't know that I should, my dear, at a thing like that," said the Nurse.
                              "Now, I'm peculiar in such matters. I feel, with Miss Latell, really sorry for the
                              poor girl.—Drop that lace a little lower, Digby; it looks hunchy.—She is not wholly
                              without talent, either. I think, if Lennox were to put her into little business for
                              a season or two, she might do very well in the profession; now<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="152-153"> </a></span> I really do. You recollect what a stick poor Lewellansy was when she first went on
                              the stage."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2550">"Those legs!" said Miss Ceelems—"fearful!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2553">"That neck!" said the Nurse, surveying her own plump figure.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2556">"I don't see what on earth the woman wanted to enter the profession at all for with
                              such a neck."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2559">"I don't see that she would want to enter it without it," thought Miss Digby.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2563">"Well, now, it's my opinion," continued the Nurse, "and I've always said—O my God,
                              Digby, child, you ran that pin clear into me; what do you think I'm made of?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2566">"And yet," said Lady Capulet, who was a very thin person, "the papers all speak well
                              of her. It shows what perseverance can do for a woman. She isn't as slender now as
                              she used to be."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2569">"Isn't it getting late, Digby, dear?" inquired the Nurse.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2572">"I'm getting awfully nervous. Do see if you can't lace my dress a little tighter.
                              I'm so—There, that's better. Now, if you'll only just pin those bows on."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2575">"Miss Hart is not too thin, I'm sure," suggested Digby.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2578">"Did you dress her, my dear?" inquired the three ladies at once.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2582">"Me! O, no! she didn't call. Besides, I don't take charge of the other side of the
                              building; that's Howe's business, when it's anybody's."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2585">"I felt some curiosity to hear what she would say for herself; that's all," said Miss
                              Ceelems. "It's ridiculous business, and I can't help but laugh at it now, though I'll
                              own I was a little angry at first; for it really did seem hard on the ladies of our
                              own company to put some one else up at rehearsal, and then call on one of them at
                              the last moment. For my own part, I'm quick to get angry; but I get over it quick."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2588">"It would have been Miss Steel's business to have gone on for the part in the absence
                              of Mrs. Wells," said Lady Capulet. "Steely told me this morning that she was willing
                              to go on; but she thought it no more than fair that she should be called to rehearsal.
                              It's really fortunate you recovered in time."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2591">"I ought not to have come out," said Miss Ceelems, which was quite true. "Mother said
                              to me, when I told her my intentions, 'Why, Fanny, you are crazy to think of such
                              a thing!' But there, I thought Mr. Lennox will be so annoyed! and I can't bear to
                              think of giving any one trouble, and Mr. Lennox is a man I respect highly. He's always
                              been a perfect gentleman in his manners toward me. I will say—"

                           <p id="d58070e2596">"Juliet, Nurse, Lady Capulet, ready for the act," shouted the call-boy, with a loud
                              knock at the door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2600">"O, my God, I shall be late!" exclaimed Miss Ceelems in consternation. "I didn't hear
                              the orchestra rung in, and I'm discovered in the—For God's sake, Digby, fasten my
                              belt quick, and don't go to sticking any of your pins into me. That call-boy! I mean
                              to complain to the management about him. He gets worse and worse. O God, Digby, you're
                              so awkward, you make a positive fright of me. There, now! Where are my jewels? Not
                              ready, I dare—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2603">"There's no hurry, my child," said the Nurse, in a great fluster. "The first scene's
                              not on yet; besides—Digby, you must really attend to me a half second. We're all on
                              together, and—I am so stout I lose breath. Not that, child; you'll ruin me; the other
                              body—the red one, of course. Now, then, attend to the lady, and be quick. Maria, dear,
                              are you most ready?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2606">Lady C., who, being in following business, did not interrupt the leaders in their
                              calls upon the dresser, answered, in a frenzy, "No, I 
                              <emph id="d58070e2608">am not;</emph> but I should be if I could only get this darned brooch to stay clasped. I believe
                              that style of brooch is the very devil incarnate for mischief; they never will work,
                              do what you will. I should have been—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2612">The prompter's whistle sounded at this moment.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2615">"My God, that's us!" exclaimed the ladies in concert; and the peculiar trio made a
                              precipitate dive for the stage.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2618">During this little dialogue the following scene took place in the manager's office:
                              Thomas Lennox was seated before his office table, with the usual amount of papers
                              before 
                              <emph id="d58070e2620">him,</emph> and with his usual cigar in his mouth.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2625">Henry Seely, prompter, also seated at the table, was engaged—to judge by appearance—in
                              mentally hushing up the proscenium, that being the only object within his optical
                              range.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2628">Marcus Dalton stood in the doorway, his face flushed with angry excitement, and perhaps
                              with something else. Marcus had but just entered. He was the stout gentleman whom
                              Gail had seen with the manager at the morning's rehearsal.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2631">"What's this I hear, Tom?" muttered Marcus, sulkily. "What have you done with that
                              smart girl you showed me this morning?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2634">Lennox glanced at the prompter, and continued his writing.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2637">"We are happily released from our embarrassment in that quarter," replied the gentleman<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="79" data-tei-n="156-157"> </a></span> referred to, shuffling in his chair, and looking anything but happy or unembarrassed.
                              "The lady resumes her own part."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2642">"By George!" exclaimed Marcus, loudly,—so loudly that the prompter involuntarily raised
                              his hand,—"what's that for?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2646">"I'm sorry, sir," pleaded the prompter, meekly. "If we could have known you had taken
                              a fancy to seeing the lady play—or perhaps you have some interest in introducing the
                              lady before the public—knew her father when you was a boy, or something of that sort—of
                              course, you know, we couldn't judge the matter by instinct."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2649">"Damn instinct," growled Marcus. "I'd made up my mind to see the girl play. I've bet
                              on her against Ceelems in the part, my two hundred to Dick Harben's one, and by George,
                              sir, she'd have carried the day without a cent out for puffs;" and Marcus again startled
                              the nervous prompter by bringing his fist down upon the manager's table with a bang.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2652">"The poor fellow's as drunk as a ——, and gone dead crazy over the lady, besides,"
                              thought the prompter, helplessly. He said, propitiatorily, "Really, now, my dear sir,
                              if you'll only listen to reason. The part belonged to the lady, our lady, if she chose
                              to play it. So what were we to do? There'd have been the deuce and all to pay, if
                              we had offended her. My God, sir, we'd have had the papers down upon us like bricks.
                              The lady pleases with the public, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2655">"I should like to know who's to be pleased in this place if I am not," muttered Marcus.
                              "Damn! you've always found my purse strings open when there's been any 
                              <emph id="d58070e2657">go</emph> on foot here. Where is the lady?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2661">"Which lady do you mean, sir?" said the prompter, nervously: "Miss Hart? She is not
                              in the building. Besides, consider, Mr. Harben favors the other lady. She came here
                              at his request, and his son Dick is awfully smashed on her, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2664">"Who's to be pleased, if I am not?" repeated Marcus, angrily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2668">"Well, but, my dear sir, I don't know that anybody is," pleaded the prompter; adding,
                              aside, "the gentleman is fearfully noisy in his cups."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2671">"Where's Martin? Send him for the lady," exclaimed Marcus.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2674">"O, my God! you're wild, my dear sir. You'll ruin us," cried the prompter, in alarm.
                              "The overture will be rung in in less than ten minutes, and the other lady is already
                              dressed for the piece."

                           <p id="d58070e2679">"Come, Dalton," said Lennox, "where's the sense of quarrelling over this business?
                              I'm the girl's friend as much as you are, and I'm the friend of the theatre too. No
                              man can gay I haven't done my share in its interest. A first appearance, under the
                              circumstances of to-night, would have done the girl no good, and you'd have lost your
                              money. By George, you must

                              till they've been warmed up for them with a little blowing—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2685">The manager was here interrupted by the entrance of a young man, who stood bowing
                              in the doorway, looking exceedingly embarrassed. He was evidently an outsider, and
                              it was equally evident that he wished to appear otherwise.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2689">"Good evening, Mr. Lennox. You see I have taken you at your word, and dropped in upon
                              you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2692">"Aha! Mr. Harben," returned the manager. "Happy, I'm sure." As a dead silence followed,
                              in which Mr. Harben blushed deeply, and pretended to be absorbed in the contemplation
                              of a side wing, Lennox remarked, "Like to look about the place some? I shall be at
                              leisure in a few moments."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2695">"O, deuce, no," answered Richard Harben, hastily. He was secretly ambitious to become
                              a fast man. "I'm used to the place; that is, I'm quite familiar with such places,
                              in general."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2698">"I'll take my oath you are," responded the manager, who seemed willing to humor him.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2701">Dick became conceited and confident immediately.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2704">"By Jove," he cried, "the governor draws it so hard on a fellow that a fellow can't
                              look at a pretty woman without being brought to account for it; and, by George, it
                              tells on a fellow's finances; but I can't quite go harness." This was a choice expression
                              Richard had borrowed from his patron, Dalton. "So, while he thinks I'm fast asleep
                              in New York, I steal a march upon him, and here I am. Do you take?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2708">The manager laughed, somewhat lazily, to indicate his intelligence. "What are you
                              doing now?" he asked, paring his nails. "Step in," he added, a moment after, smartly;
                              for what Dick appeared to be doing just at present was getting in the way of the property-man.
                              "Still in a counting-house?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2711">"By Jove, yes; boxed down as tight as,—I don't know what. But I'm not your sort for
                              that. Does for a blinder, though, for the governor, famously; and the old horse is
                              pretty sharp, too. But luck's against me to-night. The charming Fanny Ceelems fails
                              to appear."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2714">"O, the lady plays," said Lennox, suppressing a yawn.</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="81" data-tei-n="160-161"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2719">Richard blushed still more deeply.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2722">"You're doubly in luck. You'd have lost your bet if she had not appeared," growled
                              Dalton.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2726">"I don't see it in that light," said Richard, getting bolder. "Do you, Tom?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2729">"Who were to be the judges?" inquired the manager.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2732">"O, good fellows; men of our own sort, and men that know what's what," said Richard;
                              at which Dalton laughed so loudly and unexpectedly, that the prompter, who had been
                              walking up and down the side stage,—divided between his deference for the manager's
                              party and his nervousness at having the play, which had commenced, disturbed,—muttered,
                              "My God, gentlemen, you'd drown the big drum." The conversation was again interrupted
                              by the presence of the Friar, who stole solemnly in upon the worldly party, and there
                              ensued a whispered dialogue between him and the manager.

                           <p id="d58070e2744">WHEN the morning came, the sunlight crept pleasantly into the room where the sisters
                              lay asleep, and touched their faces. The touch pained Gail, and she turned away from
                              it fretfully. She had suffered through the night, and her suffering I was not yet
                              over. Jennie met it hopefully. She could begin to act on her new idea, and she sprang
                              blithely up, and was soon busy preparing the breakfast with her hands, while her head
                              was at work over her plans. Gail rose also, but slowly; her heart was heavy, and less
                              tossed by conflicting emotions, she felt more keenly the cruel ache of her disappointment.
                              There had arisen in her also a stern contempt of dishonesty. She no longer faced the
                              invisible demons that racked her soul with any weak pretence of indifference or wild
                              dreams of impossible triumph. She faced the truth instead, and wore her trouble with
                              a pride too great for vanity. She shrank only from the cure. She already began to
                              realize the old sad<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="82" data-tei-n="162-163"> </a></span> story of dragging a sick heart through a daily round of duties it is for the time
                              unfit to meet. She lingered over the arranging of her room, dreading to meet the family
                              down stairs. "I hope they will not say much to comfort me," thought the poor girl,
                              as she dusted the table for the third time. "It would upset me, I know." She looked
                              about, and saw nothing to be done except once more to wash the traces of tears from
                              her eyes. She did this carefully, shivering the while, for the room was cold, although
                              she had been unconscious of it. At the head of the stairs she paused, and listened.
                              The house was still. She could hear only the old clock in the hall, ticking with a
                              hollow rattle in its throat. She glanced from the soiled house-paper to the worn stair-covering.
                              Sights that never depressed her before, but which even glowed through the romance
                              of a new life ahead, now made her sick at heart. At the foot of the stairs, her eyes
                              fell on the basket containing the costume for Juliet. She descended quickly, and returned
                              with it to her room. The dress she had handled so affectionately the night before,
                              she snatched out of the basket, and hurried it to its place. The white slippers came
                              next, and the jewels "They shan't see these things," she said, "and be reminded of
                              last night" She worked rapidly to keep down the rising sobs; she even tried to jest.
                              "One would think, to see me, that I had committed a murder, and was trying to hide
                              the body." Two tears stood in her eyes. Through them she saw her roses blurred and
                              swelled. She paused, in her hurry, to gather up their withered leaves tenderly, and
                              take from her bureau drawer a small box. The box contained but one other treasure—a
                              ring of silver hair. She laid the white rose and the gray together, and returned the
                              box to its place. Perhaps at that moment the soul of the buried roses bloomed in her
                              heart; for when at length she resumed her duties, the objects in her home no longer
                              sickened her, or seemed commonplace. She descended to the kitchen, where she found
                              Jennie, with her sleeves rolled up, a rolling-pin in her hand, and a layer of dough
                              before her. Jennie was not rolling the dough. She was looking into the future with
                              the same bright absent expression her face had worn the night before.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2749">"How early we both got up, Jennie!" said Gail, trying to speak as if nothing had gone
                              amiss.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2752">It took a little time for Jennie's mind to come back into the present; but when it
                              did she showed a very lively interest in the things about them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2756">"Sure enough, Gail! I have had things ready for breakfast this long time, and now
                              I've started<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="83" data-tei-n="164-165"> </a></span> on dinner; and I don't know as there's any one up but you and I yet."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2761">Gail joined Jennie in her household occupations, and both sisters began to talk, each
                              avoiding the topic that was in both their minds. Jennie was not unconscious that at
                              times her sister would forget what she was about, and at times work with a feverish
                              intensity. Poor Jennie longed to comfort her, and once or twice thought of again broaching
                              the subject of her scheme; but Gail had so little faith in it, that Jennie did not
                              venture. The sisters had not spoken for some time, when Gail said, with sad sternness,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2764">"Jennie, I wish you would let me do all the work till it is time for me to go to the

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2767">"I would not go to that theatre again, Gail, if I was you," said Mrs. Hart, entering
                              in time to hear her daughter's words.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2770">"I must, mother; there is one more performance of the show-piece."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2773">"I don't see 
                              <emph id="d58070e2775">why</emph> you must on that account," returned Mrs. Hart, warmly. "Gail, you've got genius,
                              and all that, but you're dreadfully simple. Now, if I was in your place, I'd stay
                              away just to spite 'em. I would not let myself be triumphed over by a parcel of beetle-headed
                              dragons," said Mrs. Hart, pausing for a name sufficiently opprobrious ous. "They've
                              behaved dishonorably towards you. Your own father Bays they have; and I wouldn't be
                              so mean-spirited as to go near them."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2780">"It would be unprincipled not to go," answered Gail, trembling a little with indignation;
                              "and that would be like them."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2783">"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Hart, emphatically. "That shows how little you know about it.
                              It would be unprincipled 
                              <emph id="d58070e2785">to</emph> go," she added, in a tone as if she had clenched the matter with the strongest argument.
                              "Well, Gail, before I'd go among such a lot of mean stuck-ups! I'd think more of my
                              mother, if nothing else. Why, Gail, they'll laugh at you in their sleeves."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2789">"I know it, mother," answered Gail, bitterly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2792">"Besides," went on Mrs. Hart, "I'd play only the leading parts. I don't see why you
                              don't, I'm sure. You're better able than any of the women they've got there; for,
                              between you and me, I don't think much of those play-actresses. Now, I know; for I've
                              taken notice. I wonder at your letting yourself be put down so. If I was you, I'd
                              show those stage managers that I felt myself above them. I'd make them feel what they've
                              done."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2795">"I've struggled against such thoughts all night," answered poor Gail, bending her
                              face close over her work to hide her anguish.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="84" data-tei-n="166-167"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2801">"I shouldn't mind it a bit," put in Jennie. "You've done nothing wrong. It's they
                              ought to feel ill at ease to see you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2804">Gail bit her lip proudly, and went on with her work in silence. As it drew near the
                              time for the theatre, she glanced at the clock every few minutes. Its hands went slowly
                              round to the fatal hour. It was an old clock, with a harsh bell; and Gail's heart
                              turned sick at every blow it struck. Still, she wrapped her shawl about her, and started
                              for the theatre without flinching, sternly contemptuous of the painful beating of
                              her own heart. Her imagination, excited as it was by trouble, pictured an ordeal awaiting
                              her that was little less than torture. She pushed the old door open, and entered.
                              She heard it swing back harshly on its rusty hinges, as it had done the first time.
                              It no longer grudged her admittance—it mocked her. She saw the one gas flame absorbing
                              and corrupting the white light from above. It seemed to fall on the ghastly face of
                              the dead past. She shuddered. The place was empty and desolate. The old wail of the
                              tuning instruments under the stage seemed to wind itself about her heart like chords
                              from the infernal region, charming her into a death-like sleep. She was faint and
                              stifled. She groped her way dizzily upon the stage. An ugly canvas monster leered
                              at her with its meaningless painted eyes. She leaned for an instant against one of
                              the scenes, and her hold on the identity of the place gave way. She was in the tomb
                              of the Capulets. Her dead hopes were the "yellow, capless skulls, and rattling bones."
                              She made an effort to step. Darkness gathered about her. She felt something like a
                              slight touch against her forehead. Then there was nothing.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2807">When Gail opened her eyes, she wondered, for an instant, why she should see before
                              her the heavy green curtain of the theatre, instead of the familiar objects of her
                              room. To her confused senses she seemed to have been unconscious for hours, instead
                              of one brief second. She rose, and hastened to her dressing-room. The swoon had wrought
                              a change. Beyond the thought of concealing her sudden illness, she experienced only
                              weariness—a very incapacity for further mental suffering. She entered her room, as
                              she thought, quietly and in her usual manner. There followed a hush. One of the ladies
                              said, kindly, "You are not well, Miss Hart; you are faint."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2810">Gail started, but commanded herself to answer, "Not now. I was a moment ago."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2813">"She looks downright ill," said several of the ladies; and one of them added,—</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="168-169"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2819">"It's a shame to have to come up here when one is not well. I know what it is myself."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2822">"Have some of this," said all the ladies, presenting bottles to Gail. "It's good for
                              faint turns," urged the lady who had first spoken. "I'm subject to them myself, and
                              I know, poor child!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2825">"So am I," sighed another lady. "We all are in this world."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2828">"It's the 'urrying up to be in time," said Mrs. Sands, delicately ignoring what she
                              guessed to be the real cause of Gail's illness. "Gals, it's taken me that way many
                              and many's the time. First I'm flustered; then, 
                              <emph id="d58070e2830">slap,</emph> I'm gone. It's 'orrid!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2834">"I'll go off at just nothing at all," said quite a stout lady, "although you wouldn't
                              think it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2837">Each lady tendered her services to Gail, and all refrained from asking questions,
                              much to her relief. "I don't wonder I alarmed you; for I see I look worse than I feel."
                              She was looking at her own face in the glass, for the first time since she had dressed
                              for Juliet, the night before.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2841">"And no wonder," said Mrs. Sands, sympathetically. "What, with the 'urry and the 'eat
                              of the room, it will be a wonder if you hain't hill."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2844">There was some need of haste in dressing, Gail found, when she consulted her watch.
                              She was glad of this; for it occupied her time, and diverted from her the attention
                              of the ladies.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2847">It became time for the rising of the curtain. Gail descended with the rest to the
                              stage, and with them went through the weary routine of the scenes. When her services
                              were not required, she crept to her old place at the foot of the dressing-room stairs,
                              and leaned her head against the cool bricks of the building.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2850">At times she fell into half-unconscious fits, and listened dreamily to the old play.
                              It seemed to be slipping away from her, and she seemed to be slipping away from herself.
                              The familiar voices on the stage sounded hollow in the half-empty house, and were
                              mocked by a dreary echo. A large detachment of the supernumerary force had been dismissed.
                              There was no ordeal. The actors with whom she had rehearsed in Romeo and Juliet accepted
                              her presence as a matter of course. Lennox was absent, and the prompter kept his eyes
                              on his book. There seemed no enchantment now about the place. It was 
                              <emph id="d58070e2852">real life,</emph> lonely, cold, and dull. Gail drew her little shawl closer about her. She could hardly
                              believe herself in a real theatre. It would have seemed like some of the old attempts
                              at making believe, with which she used to cheat the hunger of her heart in old<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="170-171"> </a></span> times, but that she sat spell-bound while it passed her, and faded from her. The
                              actors hurried the piece, and introduced "Gags." They had no respect for the dying
                              play, that, with all the pain and weariness it had cost her, now touched Gail as something
                              sacred. She would lay in its grave so much of her dreaming youth. To the others it
                              was not a first experience, and they were tired of it. Each one, as he or she came
                              off the stage, only said, languidly, "My God, I shall be glad when this show business
                              is over!" From the green-room window a stream of daylight slanted down upon the stage,
                              robbing it of its mystery and romance. The painted faces of the actors whitened or
                              turned a sickly green as they passed across it. The strip of stage behind the scenes,
                              where Gail had paced so often, and where she had seen others pace,—where so many souls
                              had dreamed, hoped, aspired, or sorrowed,—became changed into a very "ghost's walk."
                              Gail watched the stout figure of a Sea-king,—the Friar of yesterday,—who had possession
                              of the walk; and the phantoms of all her past dreams and emotions went pacing to and
                              fro, accompanying the ghostly Friar on his solemn march.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2858">The prompter's bell sounded for the last act. It roused Gail from her stupor. She
                              realized, at that moment, that she was in the theatre for the last time: a brief hour,
                              and all would be over. She would witness the closing of the grave over her dead hopes.
                              Her heart sank heavily, and, like a drowning thing, caught about desperately for some
                              straw. The fatal minutes passed one by one. The scenes closed one by one. The prompter's
                              whistle sounded harsh to her ears. The Friar paced slowly up and down the ghost's
                              walk. Who or what was there to hope in? She raised her eyes; they met those of the
                              Friar. He had paused in his walk, and was watching her. "You like the profession?"
                              he said.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2861">"Better than it likes me," answered Gail, trying to smile.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2865">"You would like to enter it?" continued the Friar.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2868">"Yes."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2871">The Friar took one or two more turns on the walk, and then seated himself beside Gail.
                              "I would not advise one of my own daughters to adopt the stage," he said. "It is a
                              hard life, particularly for a young girl like you, not born in the profession. Still,
                              you have capacity for it, and if I could be of any service to you, I should be pleased.
                              I spoke with Mr. Lennox last night,"—Gail's face flushed, and her very heart stopped<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="87" data-tei-n="172-173"> </a></span> beating to listen,—"in reference to your appearing at my benefit. I can't promise
                              you much from it, and I've no especial influence with the management; but it might
                              prove an opening for you—at any rate, it would be practice."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2876">Saved! saved! The thankful tears sprang into Gail's eyes; if she had dared, she would
                              have seized the Friar's hand and kissed it. There were no longer any phantoms on the
                              ghost's walk. The Friar had blessed her, and they had vanished. The good Friar had
                              succored Juliet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2879">"Unless," said Gail, too much moved to speak coherently, "you have striven and failed,
                              as I have, you can never know how grateful I am to you, for I am far too stupid to
                              thank you appropriately."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2882">"No occasion! no occasion, my child. What little I can do I shall be glad to do. You
                              are a good, conscientious student in the art, and if you persevere in the right course,
                              you can in time take a high rank. I am not so sure but what it is I who ought to thank
                              you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2886">"I am sure it is not," responded Gail, quickly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2889">And the Friar, well pleased with himself and Gail's earnest frankness, resumed his
                              walk.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2892">When the Friar had played his part in this worthy manner, the Nurse came up, and played
                              hers also worthily.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2895">"You seem ill, my dear. You look quite pale. I have been trying to get a chance to

                              Blowper, the stage manager, will excuse you I know. He's a bit rough in his way, but
                              he's not a hard man. I'll speak to him for you if you wish it—shall I?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2898">"O, no!" answered Gail, whose heart was beginning to warm her cold frame wonderfully.
                              "I'd rather remain till the piece is over."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2901">"Would you, indeed, my dear? Well, I don't know but that it will be as well, the piece
                              is so nearly through. But, really, you don't look well enough to walk home; and it
                              snows, too. I ride to-night, and I shall be happy to set you down at your own door,
                              if you will let me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2905">"Thank you; it will not be necessary to trouble you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2908">"Nonsense, my dear; it is no trouble. I should like to do it. I shall be at the stage-door—now
                              remember."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2911">The Nurse nodded pleasantly, and retired to the wing to wait her cue.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2914">The Friar again paused before Gail, and whispered, impressively, "Perhaps it will
                              be as well to keep the matter you and I spoke about quiet. It doesn't do in a place
                              like this to say all you know."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="88" data-tei-n="174-175"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2919">Gail assured the Friar of her silence, and watched him grope his way down the theatre
                              cellar stairs, into submarine depths, from which he was shortly to arise as the Sea-king
                              in a sea of glass. Then she repaired to left hand, upper entrance, in four, preparatory
                              to soaring into aerial regions. She viewed the scene passing on the stage now with
                              a grateful sense of security. She was not made wildly, blindly, passionately happy,
                              as she had been by her first good fortune. She experienced a quieter sensation, one
                              touched with tenderness, for the resurrection of hope from the grave is attended with
                              more solemnity of the soul than its first joyful birth. In her suffering she had striven
                              to conquer her selfishness, and was strengthened for the light, as she had been strengthened
                              for the darkness.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2923">The other ladies were also gathered in the wing, ready for the scene. Martin, the
                              errand boy of the box-office, presented himself among them.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2926">"Which of you gals is Miss Hart?" he cried, in a manner as if this very commonplace
                              inquiry was the height of humor.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2929">"Hush!" said one of the ladies, soberly. "That's Miss Hart." Martin's manner immediately
                              toned down into the respectful. Gail's dignity of character had begun to call forth
                              this instinctive tribute of respect from the people about the place. Martin handed
                              her a letter. She accepted it with some curiosity, but placed it in her bosom till
                              she should be at leisure to open it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2932">The play over, she found the Nurse waiting for her at the stage door, as had been
                              agreed.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2935">"Jimmy Hurdy is all ready, my dear, to take us home," she said, as Gail appeared.
                              Jimmy was the livery-stable coachman, and Mrs. Leamingston had engaged his services
                              only once before; but it was her actress nature to be chatty and familiar with everybody.
                              "James, dear," she said, when she and Gail were seated in the coach, "if you'll drive
                              first to the lady's house—Where is it, my dear?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2938">Gail informed her. "No. 28 —— Street, and then take me home. I'll 
                              <emph id="d58070e2940">owe</emph> you the fare, and give you my blessing now."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2945">James accepting the conditions with good humor, the coach drove on.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2948">"My dear," said Mrs. Leamingston, "you have a great deal of love for the profession,
                              I notice."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2951">"Yes, I have," answered Gail, frankly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2954">"And you find it hard to get on to the stage?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2957">Gail felt some inclination to answer, "I have tried but little, and cannot judge;"
                              but she remembered her late contempt for deceit, and put vanity aside.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2960">"I have tried over and over again, and failed," she said.</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="176-177"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2966">"It's the way with all beginners, my dear, especially if they're not born in the profession.
                              I was very fortunate myself. I was born in the profession, and married into it. Poor
                              Leamingston, he was great in the little nice bits of character; but he was a very
                              imprudent man in his cups. He never could keep an engagement through the season."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2969">Gail held a respectful silence.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2972">"I shouldn't advise any young girl to adopt the profession," continued Mrs. Leamingston,
                              "if she has a good home, and good means of getting bread and butter elsewhere, for
                              it's a hard life; but, my dear, if you'll excuse my mentioning it, I feel quite an
                              interest in you. I really do. You seem modest and lady-like, and not obtrusive, as
                              a 
                              <emph id="d58070e2974">great many young persons are in the profession.</emph> I wouldn't say this, except between ourselves, for the theatre has always been my
                              home; but there's good and bad in all things—don't you know there is?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2978">"Yes," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2981">"Well, what I was going to say, my dear, was, that if you would like to try for an
                              engagement with us at the Union, I'll speak a good word for you with the management,
                              myself."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2985">Gail could have kissed the hem of Mrs. Leamingston's ingston's dress. "You are too
                              good," she cried. "I thought myself less fortunate than others, but I see I was mistaken.
                              There are very few who would do as much as that for a stronger."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2988">"Well, my dear, ft's my disposition. I don't boast of many good qualities, but I always
                              want to help any one who I think needs it and deserves it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2991">"But I'm afraid Mr. Lennox does not think favorably of me," said Gail, flushing slightly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2994">"What makes you think that, my child? Mr. Lennox spoke very highly of you to me. He
                              said you were a very attractive woman, and made a very fine appearance on the stage."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e2997">Gail was a shade disappointed. She would have preferred that her genius should be
                              more impressive than her appearance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3000">"I was thinking," she said, somewhat sternly, "of last night."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3004">"Well, now, my dear, you shouldn't mind that. Poor Lennox is the most tender-hearted
                              creature in the world. He wouldn't have had it happen, if he could have helped it;
                              but, between you and me,—and I say this in confidence,—there's a certain lady in the
                              building—I won't mention names—who didn't play the most lady-like part in the matter.
                              I don't blame you at all for having some<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="90" data-tei-n="178-179"> </a></span> feeling about it; but my advice to you is, Be good friends with Lennox. He can help
                              you, if any one can. Were you told to come up for the part at night?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3009">"I was."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3012">"Were you, 
                              <emph id="d58070e3014">indeed,</emph> my dear? Somebody about the building circulated quite a different story; but I believe
                              you, my dear. I think I would take your word before that somebody's; and then I would
                              advise you to say nothing, inside of the building, about what we spoke of in reference
                              to your getting an engagement for the next season. Such things are much better kept
                              dark about a theatre. I saw you speaking with Father Haines; do you know him at all?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3018">"No," answered Gail, feeling herself on dangerous ground.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3021">"No! Well, I didn't know but that you might. Poor old Hainsy!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3024">"Is he unfortunate?" inquired Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3028">"No, my dear, not at all; he's very well thought of, both in the building and outside.
                              Why do you ask me, my dear?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3031">"You spoke of him as 'poor.'"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3034">"It's my way, my dear. He's an odd being, but he's as good a soul as ever breathed."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3037">They had reached Gail's door by this time, and, thanking Mrs. Leamingston again, Gail
                              ran joyfully into the house.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3040">"What is it?" said Mrs. Hart and Jennie. Both had seen the carriage through the blinds.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3043">"Nothing," answered Gail; "only we shan't have to hire a theatre, Jennie."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3047">"Too bad," said Jennie, with anything but a sorrowful emphasis. "Why not?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3050">"Because—I'm—going—to—play—at—so mebody's—benefit," replied Gail, separating the words
                              with comical precision.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3053">"There!" said Mrs. Hart, triumphantly; "didn't I say, Go to the theatre just as you
                              always do, and keep your ears open, and you'll hear something. If I was you, Gail,
                              I'd cultivate some of those play-actors a little."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3056">"I don't suppose," said Gail, cautiously, "it will be a very good part; but, then,
                              it's better than nothing at all."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3059">"It's splendid," said Jennie; "because, you see, we can go on with our plans about
                              the theatre; and this will be all clear gain."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3062">"That is not all, either," said Gail "There's something else."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3066">"What?" inquired Jennie, eagerly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3069">"Do tell," said Mrs. Hart, with impatient excitement; "you always want to make a mystery
                              of everything."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e3074">"You remember the lady who plays the Nurse—she offered, all of her own accord, to
                              speak a good word about my getting an engagement next season. I rode home here with
                              her in her carriage."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3077">"What lady? What nurse? I saw you come 'prancing' home in a carriage; and it gave
                              me the awfulest start! I thought nothing but that one of those infernal—if I must
                              call it by name—machines there, that you go up on, had come down, and that you had
                              broken your neck."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3080">"And 
                              <emph id="d58070e3082">that</emph> isn't all, either," said Gail, suddenly remembering the note that Martin had given
                              her. She drew it forth, and read, "Dear Miss Hart, I should be happy to see you in
                              my office between ten and eleven o'clock Monday morning. Yours respectfully. Thomas
                              Lennox."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3087">These few words were written in so careless a manner, that nothing short of Gail's
                              impatient interest could have deciphered them. Mrs. Hart and Jennie, in the mean while,
                              read them much more plainly from her face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3090">"Do let's see it," cried Mrs. Hart. "Dear me! can't you read it aloud?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3093">"O Jennie, Jennie," cried Gail, when she had complied, "you don't think this note
                              can mean I'm not to play for the Friar's benefit, after all?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3096">"Of course not," said Jennie, who was even of a more hopeful character than her sister.
                              "I know it's nothing of the sort. Besides, you just look clear ahead to the goal,
                              and never mind the struggle, the sinking and the rising that come between. Swim out
                              the best you know how, and you'll reach it, be sure."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3099">"I wish I could feel as you do," answered the elder sister; "but, as it is, I guess
                              I had better try and think—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3102">"You had better go to bed early, and not lie awake all night talking about it," said
                              the mother. "You are as black round your eyes now as a coal; and you won't be fit
                              to play in anything if you don't rest. I dare say that other woman there knows precious
                              well how to take care of herself. You'd never do for the stage in that respect; that's
                              clear."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3106">Mrs. Hart was possessed of the popular idea that actors and actresses have little
                              to do with feeling, except on the stage, and are creatures of extraordinary coolness,
                              self-command, and presence of mind in every-day life.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3109">Gail followed her mother's advice, that night, in a most dutiful manner, with a sort
                              of half resolve to follow her own. But when she was alone, she again read the note,
                              which she already knew by heart, to convince herself there was nothing alarming<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="182-183"> </a></span> ing in its purport. After she had performed this little ceremony, she became less
                              doubtful and more elated.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3114">It is joy to receive something we have long desired; but to lose that thing, to bewail
                              it, and then to regain it, is to be blessed. Gail's bitter experience had broken some
                              of the little tendrils of vanity that clung to the stage, apart from her art. But
                              the roots of her nature had taken yet stronger hold of the art itself. She appeared
                              before Mrs. Hart and Jennie, on the following morning, equipped for the ordeal in
                              a plain dress and hat, and a pair of large, warm mittens on her small hands. "Jennie,"
                              she said, "you see I've got on my armor. I mean to win the battle by my fitness alone.
                              Genius requires at our hands self-abnegation from all minor vanities and petty schemes
                              of self-interest, before she will crown us with immortality. Don't you think so?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3117">"Gail, you are a perfect fool!" said Mrs. Hart, discontentedly. "Self-abne-fiddlesticks!
                              Go and dress yourself so as to look as handsome as you can. You won't look any too
                              well. Please the managers now, and keep your high-flown notion till you have the reins
                              in your own hands."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3120">"I must act as I am endowed. I have no power to be sociable, and make myself popular;
                              and I find myself wofully distracted and disabled by trying to fathom the games of
                              others. It frets me, and makes me ungenerous and suspicious."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3123">"Is big mittens indispensable to self-abnegation?" said Jennie. "Now, I think art
                              is worth respecting in dress as well as in other things, provided we do not let it
                              occupy our mind and time too much. I like to see people 
                              <emph id="d58070e3125">a little</emph> vain; it makes them happier."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3130">"Sometimes; but not when one wants to devote the full force of the mind to one purpose."</p>

                           <p id="d58070e3144">GAIL, however, did not repair to the manager's office with a mind as independent as
                              her dress. Beneath, the frank dignity was the constraint and nervousness of a morbidly
                              sensitive and imaginative nature.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3147">Lennox was seated at his table, in company with the Friar.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3151">"Good morning, my dear," said the latter, with his pompous respect.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3154">"Sit down, my dear," said Lennox, with his easy familiarity; but without, however,
                              raising his eyes from the table.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3157">Gail obeyed; and in the silence and her constraint, the air seemed to creep and gather
                              in dark waves about the objects on which her eyes were fixed. She experienced two
                              emotions antagonistic to each other. Her wounded pride at the insult her genius had
                              received from the manager was ready to fight; while the hunger of her love for her
                              art was ready to beg.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3160">"Now, then, my dear," said Mr. Lennox, glancing up, "I understand you wish to enter
                              the profession?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3163">"Yes," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3166">"I don't know," continued the manager, cautiously, "how I shall be situated for the
                              coming season; but if there is an opening I shall have you in my eye. In the mean
                              while, we have arranged a debut for you at this gentleman's benefit. We do a piece
                              we brought out here in the first of the season, called 'Nelly's Fate.' You will play—let
                              me see—Molly—Hetty—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3170">"Nelly," suggested the Friar.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3173">Gail sprang up, and clapped her hands. She had witnessed the piece, and been strongly
                              impressed with the leading part. She forgot all else in her enthusiasm. "The part
                              affords great scope," she cried, "for passionate and emotional acting, and the situations
                              are thrilling."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3176">"Well, my dear, that's all for this morning," said the manager, smiling, "except there's
                              a rehearsal at eleven—is there not, Haines?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3179">"Half past," answered the Friar.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3182">"Half past," repeated the manager. "Go down now and get Martin to give you your part.
                              The piece is in manuscript, and there are no books." The manager's familiar direction
                              sounded inexpressibly<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="94" data-tei-n="186-187"> </a></span> pressibly charming to Gail. It seemed to recognize her as one of the company.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3187">Behind the scenes she met Mrs. Leamingston, who greeted her kindly. "I see, my dear,
                              you are to appear at Mr. Haines's benefit. I'm glad of it. Your name is in the cast.
                              It's an excellent part—'Nelly Dillon.'"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3191">Gail's face flushed with the exquisite pleasure this trifling honor gave her, and
                              she stole into the green-room and glanced at the little velvet-lined, glass-covered
                              show-case, in which the casts were pinned. She dared do no more than glance; for the
                              company—many of them—were present, and she was shy of displaying the red glow of pure
                              pleasure that suffused her face, and the conscious smile that played about her lips;
                              but in her glance she saw written, in the stage manager's well-known hand, "Nelly
                              Dillon-Miss A. Hart."

                           <p id="d58070e3194">"Is there anything," said one of the actresses,—studying the cast with an air of nonchalance
                              Gail wondered she could acquire,—"that concerns me? No; nothing new; that's good,
                              and gives me a night off. Let me see, though; the bill's not up for Thursday and Friday."

                           <p id="d58070e3197">"We do that Irish piece—'Nelly's Fate'—for one thing, Friday, I suppose," said Mrs.
                              Latell—"Haines's benefit, you know; he does 'Pat Dillon.'"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3200">"O, true, true!" went on the actress, musingly. "Let me see. Is the cast up yet?—O,
                              yes! here it is. I didn't see it. Bet Fagan—Mrs. Leamingston; that's you, my dear,"
                              she added, turning to the Nurse, who had just entered; "they can't let 
                              <emph id="d58070e3202">you</emph> off, I see."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3206">"No rest for the wicked, my dear," answered the Nurse, with a smile. "Mrs. Dillon—Mrs.
                              Latell," continued the reader. "Kittie Dillon—Miss Julie Ward; so she's up for something.
                              I thought she didn't come till next season. Is it much of a part, I wonder?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3209">"It is only a few lines," said Isabel Lester. "You may know that; for I went on for
                              it in the first of the season."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3213">"It's a very good little bit, I am sure," said the Nurse.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3216">"It's a very good little bit better than Nancy," spoke up Isabel, sharply; "and I
                              do that now, of course."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3219">"Norry Croon—Miss Simpson; that's me. It's only a line or two, I suppose; so I'll
                              get Harrey Seely to let me have the prompt-book."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3222">"The parts are given out. Martin ought to have been here with them by this time. It's

                           <p id="d58070e3225">"I wonder who does Nelly's?" went on Miss<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="95" data-tei-n="188-189"> </a></span> Simpson. "I don't see Ceelems' name. Is there a blank for it, I wonder. It's a benefit,
                              you know. Ah, here it is: 'Nelly—Miss A. Hart.' Who's that? None of our company."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3230">"This is Miss Hart," said the Nurse, introducing, Gail, pleasantly. "She does the
                              part for Lewy Haines's benefit."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3234">"Ah, indeed," said Miss Simpson, coldly; "how do you?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3237">"O, here you are, Martin!" she added, warmly. "What have you got there for me?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3240">"Nothing," responded Martin, facetiously. "There won't be no parts given out in this
                              here place."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3243">"Now, Martin, you are too bad!" said the ladies, laughing at Martin's humor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3246">"Now really, though," said Martin, "Johnny hasn't got them ready."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3249">Gail was too happy and too much excited to remain still till Martin should be ready
                              with the part she was impatient to examine. She strolled out of the green-room. The
                              same chilly, monotonous murmur was taking place on the stage that Gail had observed
                              at the first rehearsal. But it no longer had upon her the same effect. She seated
                              herself to watch the rehearsal, with a new interest. The piece then on the stage was
                              "Retribution." Miss Ceelems, in the leading rôle of Clarisse, stood at the right hand,
                              first entrance, O. P., waiting for her cue. Ceelems was dressed with more than her
                              usual elegance—in a fine brocade silk and a rich camel's hair shawl. Both dress and
                              shawl were particularly becoming to the wearer's style. Miss Ceelems was tall, possessed
                              regular features, fine eyes and complexion. Her habitual expression, when not speaking,
                              was an interesting sentimental gloom, in which there was much of the stage charm.
                              When in conversation, there was in her manner a methodical, artistic gayety. She presented
                              a magnificent contrast to Gail on this particular morning; for Gail sat, in her homely
                              dress, absorbed in dreams of advancement, utterly unconscious of her own attitude
                              and appearance, while the leading lady of the Union Theatre swept past her with not
                              only a self-possessed air, but an air of possessing everything about her also. Occasionally
                              she bestowed upon Gail a glance of seeming indifference, but in reality of secret
                              hostility. She felt in Gail a rival. How dangerous, or how harmless, she could not
                              say; for, in the great game of whist,—the theatre, where so much ambition and self-interest
                              is concerned,—the players conceal their hands, and win by 
                              <emph id="d58070e3251">tricks</emph> as well as by honors; and Gail, humble as she looked, might possess<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="96" data-tei-n="190-191"> </a></span> sess weapons that did not appear. At any rate, Ceelems flung down her glove, and
                              armed herself for an emergency. She was not, however, at this moment, armed to the
                              teeth, but rather to the lips and eyes; for she greeted the manager in her most fascinating
                              actress manner.

                           <p id="d58070e3258">Lennox appeared in company with Marc Dalton; and though they passed Gail, neither
                              of them observed her in the superior brilliancy of the "leading lady."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3261">"Ah, how is me Lenny this morning?" asked Ceelems, archly. Miss Ceelems always spoke
                              to the manager as if she were in the presence of an invisible audience.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3264">"Miss Ceelems," Lenny replied, "upon my soul, I don't know. Those fellows kept me
                              up so late last night, that, as near as I can judge, I have got the deuce and all
                              of a headache."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3267">"O, Tommy, Tommy," said Ceelems, throwing a serious shade into her lighter manner,
                              "you are a sad man. I don't know whether to punish you or to nurse you; and that's
                              a fearful state of doubt. It hurts to be punished, you know," she added, saucily,
                              patting one pretty jewelled hand smartly over the other once or twice.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3270">Lennox and Dalton both laughed. "Now, by George," said the manager, "I'll let a woman
                              whip me; but I'd give a man 'Jessie' if he tried."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3273">"I suppose, then, I can't send for my big brother, as the lady in the farce does,
                              and do the business by proxy, eh?" replied Ceelems. Changing her tone, she added,
                              "But no; it shall be cured by magnetism. Do you believe in magnetism, sir? It all
                              depends on faith, you know." Fanny laid her hand on the manager's shoulder.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3277">"He believes in 
                              <emph id="d58070e3279">gal</emph>-vanism," said Dalton, laughing, "if he's flesh and blood."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3283">"You're too bad, Marc, by Jove," said the manager. "Upon my soul, Miss Fanny, I have
                              faith when I can trust the doctor."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3286">"You can trust me," said Fanny, sweetly, and at the same time artfully. "Don't you
                              know I'm a magnetic character? Who was that poor young man who wrote a poem for one
                              of the newspapers, about somebody's magnetic charms? Well, of course, that somebody
                              must have magnetic charms; for the papers always speak the truth. There, does that
                              make it feel better?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3289">"It produces a counter-irritation in the heart, my dear," said the manager.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3292">"Dear, dear!" responded Fanny; "just hear him talk. But seriously, now, talking of
                              papers, who's the theatrical critic of the Morning Compass, I wonder? Do you know?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3295">"Well, no," replied the manager, laughing. "I should suppose 
                              <emph id="d58070e3297">you'd</emph> know, if anybody."

                           <p id="d58070e3304">"Now you are too cruel," cried the actress. "I don't, 'honor bright.' I only wonder
                              somebody don't put him in a strait jacket. He ought not to be allowed to inflict his
                              insanity upon the public. He deals in adjectives, that man does. He has advanced from
                              bewitchingly charming to irresistibly fascinating in the case of your humble servant."

                           <p id="d58070e3307">"His disease must be catching," said Lennox, bowing politely. "The other papers follow

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3310">"She must have affected them all, as she has poor Dick Harben," said Dalton, "by St.
                              Peter—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3313">"You are really cruel to Dick, Miss Fanny," put in the manager, who sometimes nipped
                              Dalton's speeches in the bud, lest he should utter something positively unmannerly.
                              "Upon my soul, Fanny, I pity poor Dick. I wouldn't be Dick for considerable. By Jove!
                              poor Dick."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3316">"Dick's caught the fever awful bad," said the irrepressible Dalton, breaking out into
                              a fresh laugh. "I'm afraid Dick don't sleep well nights."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3320">"O! O! O! You're too bad, gentlemen," cried the actress, hiding the face that was
                              guiltless of a blush behind her pretty hands. "It is you that are cruel to each other."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3323">"Ah! I don't know about that," said Lennox. "We men fight in open field; but you women
                              conceal ceal the point of your weapon till it enters a fellow's heart."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3326">"Now, Mr. Lennox, you don't mean all that horrid stuff, I know."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3329">"Clarisse!" sounded the prompter's voice from the stage.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3332">"My God, that's me!" cried Ceelems, "and I ought to be round on the other side. It's
                              your fault, you naughty men."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3335">"Clarisse! Clarisse!" repeated the prompter, glancing at the wing with impatience.
                              "It's 
                              <emph id="d58070e3337">you,</emph> madam."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3342">"That prompter is really impertinent," thought Ceelems, as she hastily found her place
                              in the book. "He's 
                              <emph id="d58070e3344">officious,</emph> and wants to show off before the management Let's see! Let's see!" she said aloud.
                              "My husband's voice in that room! Ah, heavens! Count Priuli!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3348">Gail returned to the green-room, where she found Martin distributing the parts, and
                              spicing their delivery with a little bantering of his own. She received hers with
                              visible emotion, and the consciousness of the eyes that were directed towards her
                              made her timid of reading it. She contented herself—as many a lover has done in company—with
                              the secret touch of his mistress's hand, by letting the hidden charm of the contact<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="194-195"> </a></span> spread subtilely through her nerves and brain. But it was not long before she sought
                              out her old nook behind a large pile of wings, at the back of the stage, and opening
                              her little note paper book, commenced quaffing the first draughts of the magic liquid
                              that was to change her into another being. Already she had begun to feel her mind
                              fitting itself to different sympathies and circumstances, when the sound of a voice,
                              strange to the place, caused her to raise her eyes. The voice belonged to an elderly
                              gentleman, who had about as little the appearance of any of the various insects that
                              are supposed to flutter about the theatre, attracted by its injurious light, as was
                              possible. He was neither stage-struck, a fast man, an actor, nor an author. He was
                              neither ill at ease, nor at home. He was too individual to be susceptible to any skin-deep
                              influence. His body was small and wiry, but his head and forehead large, and beneath
                              a pair of dark, shaggy eyebrows burned two keen blue eyes. He peered first into one
                              wing, and then into another, as if he were searching for something.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3353">"Do these lamps smoke at night?" he asked of one of the scene-shifters, eyeing the
                              border-lights sharply. "These traps would go like shavings from only a spark. You
                              men keep your buckets ready, I hope."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3356">"Yes, sir," replied one of the men, explaining how the scenes and dresses were protected
                              by a wire covering to the lights.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3359">"Won't do to trust it," said the little man, impatiently. "Must keep your eyes peeled,
                              too—Here, what is this?" he added, ferreting out some paint pots and a can of turpentine.
                              "Tut, tut, tut! Put these things out of the way of the lights."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3362">He handled them cautiously, and glanced about the building.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3366">"They won't be there at night," said one of the men, respectfully.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3369">"See to it that they are not," said the little man, emphatically; and he looked up
                              and down, and into another wing, where he discovered Miss Ceelems, who had just made
                              her exit. Miss Ceelems met him with marked politeness.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3372">"My dear Mr. Harben, this is an unexpected pleasure to see you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3375">"I always go over the building once a month, maim," said Harben, seeming mentally
                              to hold the actress at arms' length, as if she was something even more combustible
                              than the gas, or the turpentine, and something he knew far less how to dispose of.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3378">"But, dear Mr. Harben, I am not always fortunate enough to see yon, and that is a

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3383">Mr. Harben knitted his brows. "Has that boy of mine been around here, making a fool
                              and a nuisance of himself?" he inquired.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3387">"I have not had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Richard, sir. We actresses have to be occupied
                              with our business here, and get very little time to see our friends." Fanny's reply
                              was given with peculiar emphasis.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3390">"It would do no woman any good to see Dick," said Harben, with a kind of nervous irritation
                              in his manner. "Dick's a poor boy. Dick isn't worth a red cent. A woman is much better
                              off to get her bread and butter in a good business, especially if she has the chance
                              that you have here, marm."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3393">"Ah, I know that quite well, Mr. Harben," answered Fanny, with a sigh; "and even if
                              that were not so, do you think I could be so ungrateful to you? No, Mr. Harben; I
                              have that respect for you that your wishes are paramount with me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3396">"I hope so—I hope so," muttered old Harben, with a strong shade of suspicion in his
                              tone. "It's for your own good, marm; it's for your interest to do so, especially here
                              in this place, marm. Good night, marm!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3399">"Good night, sir!" and Fanny curled her lips slightly, as she went on to the stage
                              to resume her part, while old Harben continued his search.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3402">"What are you doing there, miss?" he said, coming upon Gail's retreat.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3406">"Studying, sir."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3409">"What are you studying? How to cipher?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3412">"My part in the next piece."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3415">"O," said the old man, as if he remembered the place he was in, "don't you know better
                              than to sit here in the cold? You'll catch your death. Get up and go where there's
                              a fire. Thirty per cent. of all the consumption that occurs is got by just such tricks."
                              Gail rose with a smile, and Harben was about to leave her, when he turned suddenly,
                              and again addressed her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3418">"Did my boy Dick ever make love to you?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3421">"No, sir," answered Gail, a little scared.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3425">"Did you ever see him make love to the other woman, there, on the stage?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3428">"No, sir."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3431">"If you ever do, and she's soft on him, tell me, and I'll put you into her shoes in
                              the theatre. Ha, ha, ha!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3434">"But I shan't tell you, sir."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3437">"Why not? Why not?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3440">"Because I'm not ambitious to play the part of a spy."</p>

                           <p id="d58070e3446">The old man eyed her curiously. "But it is a good cause, and you'd get all the best
                              parts—the best parts—by it; think of that!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3449">"I can do without them," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3452">"Or you can get them without pleasing me, perhaps you mean," said the old man.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3455">"I don't know that I can," answered Gail. "Who are you? One of the influential men
                              we novices always imagine help others, and stand in

                           <p id="d58070e3461">"Ha, ha, ha!" said Harben, who seemed greatly amused at this idea. "That's

                              is an idle rascal! Good morning." The old man hurried away abruptly, leaving Gail
                              half amused, but anxious. Genius, then, the key to the people's heart, was not the
                              open sesame to the stage door. This barrier only half revealed, and still in obscurity,
                              looked, perhaps, more formidable to Gail than it really was. "My poor success of one
                              night, even if I achieve it," she thought, "cannot do much for me against such odds."

                           <p id="d58070e3496">From this time until the time of her debut, one circumstance after another occurred,
                              tending not only to confirm her in her suspicions of the potency of outside influences,
                              but to shake her faith in the people's heart itself; for in her visits to the auditory,
                              she often heard fine acting delivered to apathetic listeners, while some cheap and
                              hackneyed sentiment, shouted with sufficient noise, awoke a corresponding echo of
                              applause. Ceelems, who performed every night, rose suddenly in popularity, both with
                              the management and with the public. At the rehearsals she coquetted with Lennox, and
                              made the time he spent behind the scenes pass in a most agreeable manner. At night
                              she played with unusual confidence; the papers expressed it, with "unusual power."
                              The play of Retribution, was to prelude Nelly's Fate on the night of Gail's debut,

                           <p id="d58070e3513">THE play of Nelly's Fate is a dramatization from a touching little story, the plot
                              of which is briefly this. Nelly, the pride of the place, has a lover, a reckless,
                              unprincipled man, who is disapproved of by her father, and peremptorily sent about
                              his business. Nelly is persuaded to accept the addresses of one Dennis Ryan. Of course
                              this incurs the anger and jealousy of her old lover, Peter Fogarty. The play opens
                              with a rural ball in Tim Scollay's barn, at which Peter, by his superior audacity,
                              claims so much of Nelly's attention, as to occasion gossip in the village. At home
                              Nelly is taken severely to task for her conduct at the ball, and sets out on a nightly
                              duty to meet and assist her mother in bringing home parcels, in no very good humor.
                              Fogarty puts himself in her path, and when he cannot persuade her to accompany him
                              abroad,—whither he is obliged to flee, having since the ball committed a slight murder
                              in his native town,—he abducts her by force, Nelly's absence,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="102" data-tei-n="202-203"> </a></span> and that of her former lover, coupled with the late gossip, and the humor in which
                              she left home, conspire to cast a fearful suspicion on her name. Her own family and
                              her betrothed turn against her. In the mean while Peter is frustrated in his designs
                              by the police, and forced to leave Nelly in a cave, many miles distant from her home,
                              whither she has been conducted blindfolded, and in a swoon. She awakes to find herself
                              alone and in a strange locality. She strives to discover her way home, falls sick,
                              and is taken care of by strangers. When she recovers, and learns the time that has
                              passed during her illness, she is overcome with anguish, and though sick and feeble,
                              she again seeks her home, stealing out of the house alone, lest the good people should
                              detain her out of consideration for her weakness. When she reaches home, it is to
                              receive the curses of her father, who closes his door against her. She is found half
                              dead, by one Bet Fagan, who is everybody's friend, and who conducts Nelly to her own
                              house, and though only half believing Nelly's story, straightway sets about ascertaining
                              the truth; to which end she visits the jail where Peter is awaiting his doom, and
                              begs of him to set Nelly right before her people if possible. Peter at first refuses
                              to do this, out of hate for his rival; but upon the cunning insinuations of Bet, who
                              tells him that Nelly's heart is rather with him than with Dennis, he consents to make
                              confession to the priest. The result of this confession is the public announcement
                              of Nelly's innocence, in the church, by Father M'Cabe, and the consequent joy of her
                              family and her lover Dennis, who seek her at Bet's house, and are ready to receive
                              her. But Nelly, whose wrongs and bodily and mental illness have wrought in her a fierce
                              morbid pride, denounces her people and her lover, and turns her heart to Peter as
                              the only true love among them all. She is, however, overcome by tender memories, and
                              before dying, relents and forgives. N.B. The story ended with the denunciation, but
                              the dramatizer, being a tender-hearted mortal, throws in the forgiveness without extra
                              cost.

                           <p id="d58070e3518">The night of the debut arrived. The posters outside the building announced, in type
                              somewhat larger than the print of the general cast,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3521">"First appearance of a young lady upon any stage," and the small bills within echoed
                              the same thing more feebly, and in smaller type.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3525">Gail glanced at the posters as she passed them on her way to the stage door, and at
                              the gay throng pouring in from the street. She was reminded of the little child, in
                              days gone by, who had prayed and dreamed over being an actress,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="103" data-tei-n="204-205"> </a></span> and had been dazzled by the posters, and it came home to her that the prayer was
                              answered. For an instant the woman was not less dazzled than the child. She tasted,
                              in anticipation, a little of the intoxicating romance that awaits a successful actress
                              in the love and worship of an enthusiastic public. She was agitated also. For the
                              first time it looked to her no trifling ordeal to stand the battery of an army of
                              minds equipped with, eyes and appetites critical. "Who was she? to dare to face this
                              many-headed monster, with its serpent's hiss, and say, 'I will charm you'?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3530">But once behind the scenes, her fears took flight. The influence within was hot at
                              all exciting. There was the same dull chill, the same stillness, the same odor of
                              gas and paint, the same sleepy, blinking effect of the lights. James dozed in his
                              chair in the passage-way, with his hands in his pockets; and the prompter yawned listlessly,
                              as his slippered feet pattered softly up and down the ghosts' walk. He was waiting
                              the time to ring in the orchestra. The prompter was always prompt at his post at precisely
                              five minutes before the time.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3533">"Good evening," he said, greeting Gail in a manner so pleasant that she was surprised.
                              "You don't think that you will be at all frightened to-night—do you?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3536">"O, no; not at all," answered Gail, instinctively echoing the pleasant tone.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3539">"O, indeed!" said the prompter, still pleasantly, though a little in a manner as if
                              Gail was something explosive, and must be handled cautiously. "I didn't know but that
                              you might; that's all. Excuse my asking. It's a saying with us, that we must all have
                              stage fright, sooner or later, and perhaps your turn has not yet come. I suffered
                              awfully myself from it, when I first went on. It appeared—O, dear!—as if I never felt
                              such a sensation before."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3542">"I hope I shall prove an exception, at least for to-night," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3546">"I hope so, my dear," replied the prompter; and Gail passed on to her room.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3549">"Did you see that notice of you in the Compass?" asked Isabel, abruptly, pointing
                              it out to her, as Gail entered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3552">"No," answered Gail, feeling startled in a sort of electrical manner. "I guess you're
                              joking. Where is it?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3555">"There!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3558">Gail read, "At the Union Theatre, the bill for Mr. Haines's benefit announces the
                              first appearance of a lady upon any stage. These first appearances at people's benefits
                              are generally very stupid affairs,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="104" data-tei-n="206-207"> </a></span> the debutant being only tolerated out of respect for the beneficiary; but we trust
                              this lady will prove an exception. She has every advantage in her selection of a part
                              which almost acts itself, so to speak. Still, there are reasons why the choice may
                              be unfortunate. Miss Fanny Ceelems' unrivalled success in the part, her nice analysis
                              and powerful rendering of the emotional scenes, will be remembered by all who listened
                              to the piece at its production in the first of the season; and comparisons will naturally
                              arise, greatly, we fear, to the present aspirant's disadvantage. That such comparisons
                              are odious (especially where the lady, on the one hand, is but a novice, while, on
                              the other, she is a thorough artist, and one who has labored long and earnestly to
                              prepare herself for the stage) will not admit of a doubt. But that they will and must
                              arise is equally incontrovertible."

                           <p id="d58070e3567">"He gives Miss Ceelems credit for acting it, though. 'Nice analysis and powerful rendering'

                           <p id="d58070e3570">"I suppose you know who put that in? The Compass has taken to blowing lately, where
                              a certain lady is concerned, and sent the misguided public adrift with a breeze of
                              its own creating."

                              theories. I'll bet her against you now, inferior as she is. Don't you see? she is
                              better advertised; people are prepared to like her. It's the fashion, and human nature
                              follows the fashion blindfold. It's a mania of the instinct."

                              or, worse, they drag you back till you've forced yourself beyond their power, and

                           <p id="d58070e3597">"You'll sing another song after the performance, I'll warrant."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3600">"I shall not sing my own dirge," said Gail, with a sudden flash of triumph in her
                              eyes.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3604">The curtain rose on the play below, and the applause sounded unusually vigorous.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3607">"That is for Clarisse," said Isabel, glancing almost maliciously at Gail. "Hear the
                              fools give her their hands. They will not throw down the old idol in this city for
                              a new one. They will cling to her with all her faults, the closer if you threaten
                              them. She works on their sympathies. That applause is more than half to assure her
                              that you will not share her laurels to-night. She has had her own story to circulate
                              both outside and inside the building, you may be sure."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3610">"She really is very great in the part," said one of the ladies.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3613">"The paper speaks very 'ighly of her," said Mrs. Sands.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3616">"You hit the mark," continued Isabel, "when you said managers were wise. Lennox knew
                              just how far to bait the public with you to bring them out strong on her. It will
                              draw well, the trick. There, that is Count Priuli's entrance—only a round. It is a
                              shame, and so old an actor too. That, again, is because he brings you out."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3619">"You give them credit for too little indifference in my case. They would be wild to
                              consider me a rival to an old-established favorite."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3623">"Not at all. You don't know the theatre as I do. There are a few regular comers, who
                              are the heart of the audience. The public at large is only its hands. She has touched
                              the heart by her stories about you, and the heart has prompted the hands into applause."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3626">"Who could guess, in my disguise, that I was a rival?" laughed Gail; reflecting, however,
                              somewhat nervously, on the supposed prejudice against her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3629">"What are you looking so sober for? What are you doing? praying?" asked Isabel, after
                              a pause.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3632">"Yes," answered Gail. "I am praying."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3635">"Are you praying," said Isabel, comically, "that you may succeed to-night?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3638">"Perhaps so."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3642">"My God, what a thing to pray for!" said one of the ladies. "It's really wicked, and
                              in a theatre, too! I wonder you ain't afraid."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3645">"Well, pray," said Isabel, laughing, "that your rival may get her just due—defeat."</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="106" data-tei-n="210-211"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3650">"Too late for that now," answered Gail, inwardly striving to banish an unpleasant
                              feeling of jealousy from her mind, and thinking only of her true aim. "I'd rather
                              pray that I shan't forget my part."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3653">The applause rose again.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3656">"Is it for Clarisse?" said Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3660">"Yes. It is the scene where she is jealous, and tears up her fan."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3663">Gail applauded also.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3666">"Amen," said Isabel.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3669">In the next room, Julie Ward, dressing for the part of Kittie Dillon, sang a smart,
                              lively air over her work. Now and then she paused, laughed gayly, and a bright color
                              flushed her face. The little dressing-glass before her reflected large, lustrous eyes,
                              shaded by long, dark eyelashes, with skin like a rose-petal for delicacy of tint and
                              texture, and the sweet, wondering expression of youth that just half reveals the charming
                              dream-world in the fresh, opening soul. The little hand that passed through the shining
                              hair was snowy white, and the dainty fingers tipped by the pink of the tiny nails;
                              the whole figure more perfectly modelled than any statue. But at present Julie was
                              not thinking of the pretty face in the glass. She was dreaming of a pair of handsome
                              eyes, and a laugh and voice that charmed her. She broke off her singing, and talked
                              to herself, as she used to talk to the mouse. "I hope he won't take any notice of
                              me, whatever else he does," she said, archly shaking the golden curls over her face.
                              "If he does, he'll get told to mind his own business—he will, truly; so, now, I assure
                              you; and I don't care if he is a great manager." Julie paused to sing the first verse
                              of her song over again, with a more sprightly, saucy expression. "Come up on purpose
                              to see 
                              <emph id="d58070e3671">him?</emph> No, I thank you, sir!" making a low courtesy. "I should hope I had some other things
                              to think about. Let him walk home with me? O, 
                              <emph id="d58070e3674">no,</emph> I thank you again, sir!" with another courtesy; "I am old enough to take care of
                              myself;" and Julie glanced into the glass, pursed up her pretty lips saucily, and
                              then, being dressed, tripped down stairs, humming the tune she had sung. Down stairs,
                              she peeped shyly into each of the wings, and was a little scared. So she ran round
                              into the green-room. "I like the green-room," she thought. "It is light there, and
                              the people are always pleasant, and like to see other people; and now that's so much
                              better than being cross!" But to-night, when Julie took a look in at the green-room
                              door, she whispered, with demure solemnity, "Everybody seems to be somewhere else,
                              but just the actors." However, Julie<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="107" data-tei-n="212-213"> </a></span> entered, and seated herself. The objectionable actors welcomed her with compliments
                              that did not seem as charming as usual. Julie found the room lonely. The door 
                              <emph id="d58070e3679">only</emph> attracted her. She watched it, half wistful and half frightened; but no figure appeared,
                              except that of Mr. Haines, the beneficiary, whose habit, when not engaged in the piece,
                              was to haunt the stage and the green-room with a solemn sort of restlessness, rehearsing
                              his part in a sepulchral under-tone. He appeared and disappeared so many times, and
                              caused Julie so much trepidation and disappointment, that she murmured, reproachfully,
                              "He needn't do that the whole time, if it is his benefit." She wandered out among
                              the scenes again. It was lonely there, also, and Julie said to herself, "I believe
                              it is lonely everywhere, except in the direction of the prompter's three bright lights,
                              and that is too near 
                              <emph id="d58070e3682">his</emph> office. It would not do at all to go and stand there." So she seated herself on the
                              O. P. side, and pretended to be looking very hard at the play. "He may come round
                              here," she thought, "and I'd have him to know that people feel interested in plays
                              sometimes, though this play is not a bit interesting, except just the part where 
                              <emph id="d58070e3686">she</emph> faints and 
                              <emph id="d58070e3689">he</emph> comes in. It's kind of nice about that, but it don't come in till the last act."
                              Julie sighed, and glanced across the stage; but some instinct still kept her from
                              the prompt side. She rose, stood in one of the big wings, and began drawing lines
                              with her fingers on the dusty canvas. "I wonder if he is a wicked man?" she mused.
                              "Or married? or anything horrid? He frightens me. He's not like Fred; but then Fred
                              was only a child, and, to say the truth, he's not like another big boy I know, either,
                              who is 
                              <emph id="d58070e3692">almost</emph> a man; but then the least I say about him, the better, for he's not a very edifying
                              subject, if his name is William. He's different from those. He's a great deal handsomer."
                              Julie crossed and recrossed her lines, and her face began to look less sober. "If
                              he thought I was pretty when I had on only my old clothes, I wonder what he will think
                              now that I am all dressed up in my peasant's dress, with flowers in my hair?" She
                              drew a circle round the lines, and started, and drew her hand away quickly, for she
                              heard, not far off, the voice she had had in her mind. The same instinct that had
                              made her keep away from the lights caused her to turn and try to escape; but she was
                              too late. The manager's imposing figure already stood in the entrance.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3696">"Not running away from me, Julie, I hope?" he said, stopping her, and forcing her
                              to look into his face.
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="108" data-tei-n="214-215"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3702">"I don't want you to talk to me," replied Julie, coquettishly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3705">"Now that's too bad! because, Julie, you are irresistible. Come here; I want to see
                              how you look;" and Lennox drew Julie into one of the empty dressing-rooms adjoining
                              the stage, used only during the engagement of stars, and closed the door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3708">"Why, your heart beats like a rabbit in a trap. You're not afraid of me! That would
                              be non-sense."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3711">"I'm not much afraid of anybody," answered Julie, with a pretty toss of her curls;
                              "but—" glancing nervously at the closed door nevertheless.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3714">"There's nothing there," said the manager, seating himself between Julie and the door,
                              and placing Julie before him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3717">"I know it," responded Julie; "but hadn't we better have it opened? Stage business,
                              Mr. Manager, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3721">"I'll take care of that, Julie. Besides," he added, with a laugh, "I'm not going to
                              devour you, except with my eyes; and I'm not going to keep you long. Where do you
                              live, Julie? Who takes care of you? Paternal and maternal relatives, I suppose."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3724">"No," answered Julie, alarmed as she pictured the formidable trio at home. "I hope
                              you don't intend to call," she thought; "because, if you do, I'm afraid you'll find
                              
                              <emph id="d58070e3726">me out,</emph> and the minds of the others fixed upon higher things.—There's only me and step-mother,"
                              she added, softly, not considering it necessary to mention the two Meshers.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3730">"Step-mother kind to you?" continued the manager.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3733">"I fear she is," said Julie, "to my immortal soul; but she don't think much of—of—me—myself."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3736">"She don't beat you—does she, Julie?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3739">"O, no; not now," replied Julie, blushing; "I'm too large."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3743">"How old are you, Julie?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3746">"Horrid old!" said Julie, with a happy shade of vanity; "way sixteen."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3749">"Who comes to see you? Plenty of young men, I'll be bound."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3752">"Is catechism most over?" put in Julie, archly, but secretly anxious to change the
                              subject; "or have we got to come to, 'Who went into the ark?' And I don't so much
                              mind that; either," added Julie aside, "if it doesn't end in, 'Who comes out of the
                              back upper window?' for, to say the truth, I'm not in the habit of 
                              <emph id="d58070e3754">sneaking out at the front door,</emph> and I don't like to see it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3758">"We haven't got by, 'Who was the first man?' yet, Julie. Let's have your answer."</p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="109" data-tei-n="216-217"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3764">"You don't happen to mean, who was the first big boy—do you? There's no first man.
                              There's only just a tall boy; and he don't call," added Julie, laughing.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3767">"O, there's a tall boy, eh?" said the manager. "Well, what does your tall boy do,
                              Julie? Put, his arm round you, so? and draw you to him, so?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3770">"No; I guess he don't. I should put my hand on his, so! and so! and so!" slapping
                              the hand that held her round the waist, smartly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3773">The manager laughed. "By Jove, Julie," he said, "if your tall boy don't catch it worse
                              than that, he'll do so again, some time, when you're not minding."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3776">"You mustn't call him a tall boy, when his name is William all the while," laughed
                              Julie, merrily. She was beginning to feel more at ease, and very happy.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3779">"O, his name is William—is it?" said the manager, still embracing Julie.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3783">"Do let me go!" said Julie, frightened again at this. "I'm afraid I'll scream if you
                              don't."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3786">"Now, Julie, you don't mean that. Come, stay so—won't you?" said Lennox, with a tone
                              and look that entered the poor child's soul like wine, and made her feel light and
                              gay. She answered,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3789">"Well, then, Will blushes dreadfully when he sees your humble servant, and walks,
                              first before, and then behind, till I get so nervous I don't know what to do; and
                              I just say to him, 'Did you come out here to see me, or somebody else?' just to help
                              him on, you know; because," added Julie, saucily, "he's not near so bold as you are,
                              to say nothing of his being a 
                              <emph id="d58070e3791">great deal handsomer.</emph>"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3795">"Is that so, Julie? Well, what next?"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3798">"Well, 
                              <emph id="d58070e3800">next</emph> he says, 'M—m—miss, shall I carry your book? It m—m—must be heavy.' Then I smile
                              sweet and sentimental like, and hand him my play-book, which he always drops, blushing
                              still more; because you know," insinuated Julie, cunningly, "it's so 
                              <emph id="d58070e3803">awfully</emph> heavy."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3807">"Upon my soul, Julie!" said the manager, "I'm afraid you're destroying Will's peace
                              of mind."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3811">"And then," continued Julie, glancing at her companion roguishly, "I say, Stupid!
                              although Will isn't 
                              <emph id="d58070e3813">that,</emph> because he goes to the high school, and knows Latin, and lots."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3817">"My God, Julie!" said Lennox, "go home. You're enough to tempt a saint."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3820">"What! right away, now, before the play, do you mean?" asked Julie, alarmed by the
                              tone, but still with a shade of coquetry.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3823">"No, my child; I don't mean that; but you're so young, and know so little of the world;
                              and one<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="110" data-tei-n="218-219"> </a></span> of these days you might make some poor tall boy a charming little wife; and upon
                              my soul, I don't want to do you harm."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3828">"But you needn't—need you?" whispered Julie, caressingly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3831">"I don't know about that, Julie; if I saw much of you, my resolution would go to the
                              dogs; for, deuce take it, Julie, you're the most bewitching little woman I ever met."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3835">Julie was not simple: what the manager said had to her, in a vague, unlearned way,
                              its true significance; but she loved him, and when his words took from her her purer
                              hope, she was bewildered and alarmed, and in the moment of danger instinctively clung
                              to her false love. She added low, and almost in spite of herself,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3838">"

                              are just ordinarily good-looking."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3844">"Now, damn it, Julie," whispered Lennox, "you know better than that."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3847">"Don't use words," said Julie; "it's wicked. 
                              <emph id="d58070e3849">Yes, you do;</emph> you want to send me away, and you want never again to say pleasant things to me;"
                              and Julie put her two arms around the manager's neck, and looked beseechingly into
                              his face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3853">"Now, I'll be d—blessed if flesh and blood can resist this," said Lennox. "Julie,
                              don't you want a lover?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3856">"I don't want 
                              <emph id="d58070e3858">him</emph> for my lover," answered Julie, naively.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3863">"No, hang it, Julie, 
                              <emph id="d58070e3865">I</emph> don't, either; take me. I'll do for a lover, after a sort, I dare say."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3869">"You sent me away, and I'm going home," said Julie, trying to still the beating of
                              her heart.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3872">"I don't know about that! I don't think you can, just now. Try!"</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3875">Julie made an effort, but the arms that held her were powerful. The manager bent over
                              her and kissed her. "I'll tell you what we'll do," he said, "you and I. We'll get
                              a sleigh and some fine horses, and go to ride after the rehearsal to-morrow; and we'll
                              find some pleasanter place to take supper than step-mam's, eh! You'll go, Julie—won't
                              you?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3878">"Would you go, if you was me? I should like to. It would be fun," cried Julie, striving
                              to blind herself, and plunge into her false happiness with a reckless gayety that
                              was at heart so sad, and that, with all its assumed simplicity and coquetry, had in
                              it a shading of earnest appeal. The man felt this and was silent, but only for an
                              instant. A glance at the lustrous eyes, and he whispered, "I shall have that sleigh
                              around by two o'clock tomorrow."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e3884">"Well," answered Julie, trembling with agitation; "

                           </p>

                              fascinating, irresistible little angel that ever—" The manager stopped his utterance
                              with a kiss, and added to himself, "that ever tempted a man into sin, and sent him
                              to the devil.—Love you, Julie?" he said aloud. "Yes!" and Lennox drew Julie upon his
                              knee, and kissed her again and again.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3902">"You won't forget it," whispered Julie, leaning her head against the manager's shoulder.
                              "You won't, you won't—will you? You'll promise me you won't. I mean for always. O,
                              Lenny! Lenny! Lenny! I love you so! I love you so! I'd go and break my heart if you

                              and said, reproachfully, "I am real wicked to keep being afraid, and teasing you,
                              and all that; but you don't mind it—do you? Say you don't mind it. Let me hear you
                              say so. There, now! I'm going to run away," she added, capriciously. "I want to wash
                              my eyes so that they won't see I've been crying; that would be so horrid, you know."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3908">"There's no hurry, Julie," said Lennox. "Stay a bit; kiss me again, and try to laugh.
                              I want to see you merry before I let you go."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3912">Julie complied with a shy, timid sweetness; but her lip quivered, and there was a
                              shade of despair in her face.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3915">"Well, now go, my darling," whispered Lennox; "but by Jove you must run quick, or
                              I shall keep you here all night, and play the deuce with the piece."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3918">The manager rose, opened the door, and Julie slipped out.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3921">Left to his own reflections, Thomas Lennox was not at all at his ease. It was not
                              his heart that was hungry. Julie's beauty, and her fresh, piquant manner bewitched
                              him, while the love she was so ready to cast at his feet troubled and even annoyed
                              him. Her youth, the touching pathos of her weak nature, and her strong, hopeless love,
                              haunted him; but he lit his cigar, tossed off a glass of wine or two, and found it
                              easier to drown this one care than to banish from his mind the girl's enchanting<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="112" data-tei-n="222-223"> </a></span> grace, or cast out the passion that made him impatient for the morrow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3926">Julie, when she found herself outside the door, was frightened and oppressed with
                              a shame that made her want to hide her face, and slip off to her dressing-room unseen.
                              The stage, with the voices on it, sounding strange and distant, seemed so lonely and
                              cold, that it struck a chill into her fevered brain, and she shivered; but Julie,
                              as she ran off to her room, did not cover her face; she tossed back her curls with
                              a gay, defiant little laugh; and as she stood before her glass, smoothing her creased
                              dress, and arranging her tumbled hair, she sang a gay, reckless song—a song that repeated,
                              "O, a short life and a merry life for me." She thought of her ride, a wild, free ride,
                              over the long snow-covered roads, all glowing with the bold kiss of the winter's sun,
                              and her song rang out yet more clear. She thought of her lover's handsome eyes, and
                              the clasp of his arm, that would be all hers for one brief afternoon, and the song
                              grew low and tremulous. She thought of her own deceit, and the stern, forbidding faces
                              at home, and the song died on her lips. Her own face became anxious with care, but
                              her heart, after its own fashion, echoed the words of Macbeth, "I am in guilt stepped
                              in so far, that, should I wade no more, returning turning were as tedious as go o'er."
                              Julie hummed her song, and by and by a sly smile began to play around her lips, as
                              she thought, "What would Will, or some of the actors and actresses, think, if they
                              should see me riding with 
                              <emph id="d58070e3928">him;</emph> wouldn't they be jealous?" Julie's dress and hair were in order; still she did not
                              descend. She seated herself before her toilet shelf, and dallied with the articles
                              there, still singing, but with a voice that was low, and at times broken, till the
                              song again faded, and Julie found herself sobbing and trembling.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3932">It was not the all-powerful monarch, throned in a gold-paved celestial city, with
                              white-robed, singing angels to do him homage, the omnipotent spirit,—not of nature
                              and human nature, but far above them,—that the child had been taught to fear and worship,
                              that awed the woman now. Neither was it Satan, in a world of burning torture, that
                              she shrank from, as the child had done. It was simply an instinct of conscience, or
                              purity. For a time the groping soul bowed before this natural messenger of God, and
                              feared, as a child in the dark might, before an angel sent from heaven with a warning.
                              Only to poor Julie, with her new love, the messenger seemed cruel, rather a fiend
                              than an angel. She tried to banish it from her mind, and dream on, as the child, hiding
                              its terrified eyes<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="113" data-tei-n="224-225"> </a></span> beneath the bed-clothes, had striven not to see the phantoms of its nightmare. But
                              there were no bright home spirits to awaken the woman into a natural sunny reality,
                              as there had been for the child. There was no gray-haired father, whose face, when
                              he should learn her guilt, would turn pale with pain and surprise; no brother, into
                              whose heart, all young and fresh for joy, should spring the passion and fever of a
                              just wrath against her seducer; no mother, to be made anxious and watchful by the
                              sorrowing faces about her; no group of wondering little ones, crying and pitying her
                              for they knew not what; no companion sister, whose loving eyes should fill with tears,
                              and whose quivering lips should say, "It is still our own Julie, that used to play
                              with us, and that, with God's help, we will still love and protect." Julie had no
                              such picture to help her now, in her hour of need. So she sang, to banish the phantoms
                              conjured by her conscience, in the darkness of her blind, doubting soul, and clung
                              to her love; excused, idealized her lover; and even rebuked herself for heeding the
                              instincts that condemned him. It was not only Julie's vanity that fluttered about
                              the false light; her cheated heart crept also to it for warmth.

                           <p id="d58070e3938">The play of Retribution went on successfully. Miss Ceelems stood in the green-room,
                              her face radiant with triumph. The green-room table was heaped with floral offerings.
                              "Dear me! What shall I do with all this?" cried Miss Ceelems, appealing to the manager
                              and two newspaper critics, who were present. "They are truly lovely, and I adore flowers;
                              but I'm afraid I shall have to abandon the profession, and engage in the floricultural
                              line."

                           <p id="d58070e3944">"Madam, you would rob the stage of one of its brightest gems," said one of the critics,
                              who possessed a ready wit.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e3953">"Stars shine with a borrowed light," said Ceelems, with a confident impression that
                              all stars were planets; "and I feel sure I owe my lustre to the generous friendship
                              of you, gentlemen."

                              knowledge of astronomy.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e3971">"I do not, for one," said the gentleman who had last spoken.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3974">The debutante slipped quietly down from her dressing-room, and took her usual seat
                              on the steps. No one observed her. She saw Miss Ceelems' triumphant face, the manager's
                              elated manner; heard the critic's flattery, and the applause of the crowd in front;
                              and she began to lose confidence. Her judgment did not sanction Miss Ceelems' rendering
                              of the part. The scene then on the stage was the one in which Clarisse, fascinated
                              by Count Priuli, and tossed by doubt and jealousy of her husband, receives the Count.
                              The Count's purpose is to ruin the wife to avenge himself on the husband. Clarisse
                              is a weak woman, and the emotion first to be rendered is the creeping, shuddering
                              presentiment of the Count's approach. Then follows the terror with which she is overcome
                              in his presence. She lowers her voice, glances stealthily around, and asks him if
                              he is sure no one saw him enter. On the Count's assuring her that he has been unperceived,
                              she implores him, in wild, broken sentences, to leave her. The Count makes show of
                              doing so, when, again yielding to the fascination he exerts over her, she reaches
                              out her hand, and utters his name tenderly and helplessly. When he returns to her,
                              Clarisse expresses, with a sudden blind fervor, the terrible influence he holds over
                              her. At the close of the recital, sinking with shame, and covering her face with her
                              hands, she pictures, with equal intensity, the ruin that must result from yielding
                              to her passion. Miss Ceelems rendered this scene with none of the change and shading
                              of emotion necessary. She depended on attitudes for effect, and did not depend on
                              the passion to inspire the attitudes. Her emotion was simply stagy. Nevertheless the
                              scene ended in a good round of applause, and Retribution continued in triumph to its
                              close. The green curtain fell; and Gail began to feel a very unpleasant sensation
                              of suspense. There was a vociferous call for Clarisse and the Count. Poor Gail was
                              pushed aside into a dark recess, while her rival, led by the Count, swept majestically
                              past to the stage, courte-sied low, cast her eyes swiftly over the parquet, favored
                              the audience with an emotional smile expressive of her gratitude and agitation, and
                              retired. Gail came out of her recess, and crept still higher up the steps, that she
                              might be out of the way of the carpenters, who were setting the stage. For a while
                              all tangible doubts and reasonings fled from her mind before one sickening, painful
                              dread. With a fast-beating heart, she prayed that if she could not triumph, she might
                              at least<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="115" data-tei-n="228-229"> </a></span> be spared from a disgraceful failure. The men hurried their work. The characters
                              and peasants of the piece gathered on the stage. Gail descended dizzily, and took
                              her place among them. The prompter rang the first bell. Gail's breath came and went
                              quick, and the stage seemed to grow dark. She strove to hold her lip and hand still,
                              and bend her mind to the first line of her part. She had a vague impression that some
                              one said in her ear, "You are a little scared, my dear; but never mind: you'll get
                              over it after the first word."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3979">"Are you ready?" said the prompter. "She doesn't hear. O, my God! this will never
                              do! The lady is going to faint."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3983">Gail raised her hand a little proudly and impatiently. "Ring up!" she said; "I am
                              ready."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3986">"O, all right, my dear," replied the prompter. "I only wanted an answer."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e3989">The second bell sounded. Gail's heart stood still. The curtain rose swiftly. She felt
                              the warmth of the foot-lights against her cold cheeks, and was blindly conscious of
                              the mass of faces and the flutter of fans and programmes before her. There was a dead
                              silence. Not one hand greeted her. The players glanced at one another, and whispered,
                              "Shame!" Miss Ceelems, in the wing, chatted yet more lively with the manager. The

                           <p id="d58070e4015">A clear, natural voice answered, with the proud, shy dignity of the character, "It
                              isn't fair to ask me to dance so often, Pety." The spell was broken. It was no longer
                              the frightened debutante whom an apathetic public refused to cheer, but the village
                              favorite, the proud, earnest girl, full of fresh enjoyment of the dance, shaded by
                              an anxiety for her reckless lover and friend. The audience began to manifest unusual
                              interest in the scene. The music and dance commenced. Bet whispered to Nelly, as she
                              chasséd past her, "Don't mind their not applauding, my dear. It's only because yours
                              is a strange face;" and, in another turn, "You stood among the others, and they didn't
                              know you. It's often so." But Gail, as Nelly, was thinking of a wild country and the
                              power of lawless<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="116" data-tei-n="230-231"> </a></span> less men. She drew Peter aside when the dance was over, and, throwing all the earnestness
                              of the character, and the foreshadowing of evil, into her utterance, she whispered
                              distinctly, "For the love of all that's good, Pety, don't go with the boys to the
                              still to-night. I heard that the gauger's men are hunting close upon it, and there'll
                              be murder surely."

                           <p id="d58070e4020">The scenes changed, one for the other. There was still a silence in the audience;
                              but it was the applause of a strict attention. Poor Nelly's fate was followed, step
                              by step, till the last sad phase of her story. She sits in Bet Fagan's house, facing
                              alone the inevitable death she feels approaching, proud and stony, dead already in
                              soul, as it were. The priest's revelation has been made, and Nelly's family and neighbors
                              enter joyfully. She rises slowly, and stands before them, pale and motionless, with
                              an outstretched hand.

                              spring at once into Nelly's veins. She gathers all the anguish, the outraged love
                              and pride, the bitter shame and suffering into two words, and hurls them at Dennis's
                              feet in one scornful, mad flash.

                              and there was one tremendous burst of applause. No muscle of Gail's face changed.
                              She still stands, until, with a wild, bewailing sob, she cries, "Keep back, all of
                              you. You're nothing to me, and I am nothing to you."

                              the auditory. The people had arisen in a body. Then came cheers, loud and prolonged.
                              Gail opened her eyes dreamily. The play had been 
                              <hi id="d58070e4173" style="font-style: italic;"></hi>real, and the real seemed confused. A sudden excitement prevailed on the stage, and
                              behind the scenes. A group of eager faces surrounded her, and poured praises in her
                              ear.

                              gathering through the piece broke again into applause, that shook the old Union Theatre
                              to its foundation. The excitement behind also increased.

                           <p id="d58070e4186">"Not yet! not yet!" vociferated the stage manager, who was never collected in the
                              best of circumstances, and who appeared to have fallen a victim to a species of gesticulatory
                              fit, in his efforts to render himself heard above the noise.

                              what's amiss? By the saints, we shall have the benches at our heads if this goes on
                              much longer."

                              done for poor Blowper, he'll be borne from us in a deadly swound."

                           <p id="d58070e4206">The curtain rose and fell while yet the applause was unabated.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4210">"By Jove, they'll make us close for repairs—they won't be satisfied. Take her before
                              the curtain, Haines. Now, then, my dear, give them your prettiest smile."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4213">The little crowd fell back, and the bewildered girl was led before the audience, cheered
                              and applauded to a furious climax. A shower of flowers, a twinkling of gloved hands,
                              a quiver of gay colors and faces, the dazzle of the lights a moment before her eyes,
                              and a flitting emotion within her, as if she might either laugh or cry, and Gail had
                              passed across the stage, and was again behind the curtain. The brief commotion was
                              suddenly stilled, the lights put down, the stage cleared, and Gail stood before her
                              glass, wondering, dreaming in a flutter of blissful agitation, with the manager's
                              last words sounding in her ears, "I will see you to-morrow, my dear." She began to
                              realize that her success was unusual. Never before had the audience failed to rise
                              promptly some minutes before the close of the piece, and spoil the finale. Never had
                              there been so much excitement and discussion among the actors. Even Miss Ceelems'
                              demonstrative indifference had been awed into silence.

                           <p id="d58070e4228">ON the morrow, Gail, in her own room, reflected, exultingly, over her success of the
                              night previous, and her possible future. A little to her surprise, she heard the well-known
                              voice of Mr. Lennox inquiring for her below. If she had had any doubt of his presence,
                              it was speedily dispelled by a detachment of the younger members of the family scampering
                              up stairs, and shouting to her, at the top of their lungs, "Gail, Gail! it's the manager;
                              it really is!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4231">"Hush," said Gail, hastening to the head of the stairs, with some trepidation.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4235">"You don't believe it," cried the children, in concert, "but it's true; just peep
                              over the banisters, and you'll see him for yourself. He's standing in the entry; here's
                              a good place; just look over."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4238">The fact that the manager was made aware of her exact locality did not tend to compose
                              Gail.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4241">"Run down," she said aloud, politely. "Ask the gentleman to walk in; and tell him
                              I'll be down presently." She added, in an emphatic undertone, "Not all of you, for
                              gracious sake! one!" The heedless children, however, swarmed down in a body to where
                              Mr. Lennox stood, quite deserted, for the two elder girls had retired precipitately
                              on catching a glimpse of his coat through the sidelight.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4244">The bashfulness of the little ones was put to flight by their united strength, and
                              they encouraged the manager with cheerful shouts, "She's coming down! She's coming
                              down! Go into the parlor; you must; she wants you to; she said so."

                              to change her confusion for a sufficiently dignified manner, did not regain her self-possession
                              when she heard her mother's voice join with the children's in welcoming the stranger.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4250">Mrs. Hart came forward in an unconcealed flutter of excitement. "We are really very
                              glad to see you, Mr. Linton. (Mrs. Hart was one of those women who "never could remember
                              names.") You really must excuse the children. Our children are brought up to say just
                              what they think. It's Mr. Hart's way of educating them. He believes in free speech,
                              and all such things. Abigail will be delighted to see you. She was saying to me<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="240-241"> </a></span> the other day," continued Mrs. Hart, inventing a flattering fiction, "that she wished
                              Mr. Linton would come up some time. She would like to show you her books and flowers.
                              You and your wife, too," went on Mrs. Hart, mindful of the proprieties of life.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4256">The manager's answer must have been something flattering to herself, for Mrs. Hart
                              immediately responded,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4259">"Yes, indeed, our Gail is a very great genius. 
                              <emph id="d58070e4261">You,</emph> as a stage-manager, ought to know. Her own father says," continued Mrs. Hart, laying
                              great stress on her words, as if Mr. Hart's evidence was the most disinterested in
                              the world, "that, as a play-actress, she is equal to Charlotte Cushman; but, for the
                              matter of that, all my children are geniuses, and always have been from their cradle
                              upwards."

                              three others, had formed a row before the manager, in order to enjoy the full lustre
                              of his presence.

                           <p id="d58070e4268">"Yes, you are," answered Mrs. Hart, smartly. "Don't you know that it isn't polite
                              to contradict your mother?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4271">"I suppose," said Mrs. Hart, again addressing Mr. Lennox, "that any of my children
                              would make good play-actors; but then there's my second daughter, Jennie, she's quite
                              a notion of—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4274">Gail entered at this time, with a manner somewhat more cold than was quite necessary.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4278">"Ah, good morning, my dear," said the manager, rising to meet the successful debutante.
                              "How do you find yourself after the fatigues of last night?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4281">"How very familiar in his manners!" thought Mrs. Hart, "to say my dear to our Gail;
                              so young a man, too; but I suppose it's the way of those foreigners; and I saw at
                              once that he was an Englishman, or a southerner, and I suppose, by that, that he's
                              intemperate—they all are."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4284">"I merely dropped in this morning to mention," said the manager, lowering his voice,
                              "that we continue the piece till further notice. I may depend on your appearance?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4287">"Yes, sir."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4290">"Step round to the theatre about ten o'clock, when the office is open, and we will
                              enter into arrangements about the terms. Good morning, my dear!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4293">"Grail," whispered Mrs. Hart, nudging her daughter, "why don't you ask Mr. Lennox
                              to stay longer? You never seem to know what's for your inter—what's polite, child."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4297">"Thank you, madam; but we managers get<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="242-243"> </a></span> little or no time for pleasure. I congratulate you on the possession of so gifted
                              a daughter. Miss Abigail is looking this morning the picture of all that is attractive."
                              The mother smiled and nodded, and the daughter frowned, while the children danced
                              and capered about Gail's skirt in a most embarrassing manner, inspired thereto by
                              the supposed tender nature of the manager's greeting.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4302">At the theatre, some hours later, the eye of Miss Fanny Ceelems fell on this notice
                              in the morning's paper.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4305">"Owing to the unparalleled and almost miraculous success of Miss Abigail Hart in the
                              leading rôle, the popular little drama of Nelly's Fate will continue to be the attraction,
                              at the Union Theatre, for some time to come."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4308">Miss Ceelems changed color. "Well, upon my soul! Do you mark that, Mrs. Leamingston?
                              Did you observe anything 'unparalleled or miraculous' about that business of last
                              night? My God, I like the impertinence of it too. I believe I was engaged here for
                              leading business. A mere ballet girl! I never was so treated in any theatre. I shall
                              speak to the management directly."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4311">"Well, now, if you'll take my advice," said Mrs. Leamingston, "you won't say anything
                              about it at all. The manager knows his own business—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4314">"And 
                              <emph id="d58070e4316">I</emph> know mine, too," said Fanny; "and I will not be insulted."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4321">"I only speak for your good," began Mrs. Leamingston; but Fanny swept out of the greenroom
                              to the stage. She found the management in full force. Mr. Lennox, Mr. Seely, and Mr.
                              Harben, the lessor, were all present. Miss Ceelems was somewhat abashed; but she was
                              too angry and jealous to draw back. She did not observe that Gail also was on the
                              stage, waiting, perhaps, for some papers concerning her brief engagement to be made
                              out.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4324">"I understood that I was engaged here for the leading business," said Fanny, in a
                              low, angry voice, to the manager.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4327">"Certainly, madam," answered Lennox, with a slight flush.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4330">"Then what am I to judge by this?—this notice? "Fanny suppressed her anger, and assumed
                              as much politeness as she could.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4333">"Nothing, my dear madam. The lady did well in the part, and we venture the piece on
                              trial."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4336">"It's a mere star—a—a sort of star engagement," murmured the prompter, soothingly.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4340">Miss Ceelems regarded him with withering disdain. "I have not been accustomed," she
                              said, addressing the manager, "to things of this sort. It is got what I expect."
                           </p>
                           <span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="123" data-tei-n="244-245"> </a></span>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4345">"But, my dear madam, we can't help what you expect," retaliated the prompter, but
                              not, however, audibly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4348">"It does not at all interfere with your position in the building, I assure yon," said
                              the manager. "It is an entirely separate affair. There are no lines in any theatre,
                              except what are subject to the interests of the place."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4351">"The case was not so stated to me," said Fanny, raising her voice.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4354">"It is always understood," replied the manager, somewhat impatiently, but politely—"always
                              understood."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4358">"Interest!" said Fanny. "I believe public were well satisfied with 
                              <emph id="d58070e4360">my</emph> rendering of the part. You can consult the papers. I consider that the business belongs
                              to me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4364">Gail felt the color leave her cheek. She understood little about the rules and customs
                              of the theatre, and had little reason to trust in the manager's word. "Miss Ceelems
                              may be right," she thought; "and in that case it is my duty to resign the part."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4367">"Now, my dear Miss Ceelems," said Lennox, with a slight laugh, but still in a low
                              voice, "a lady of your penetration must be aware that it is a part of the duty of
                              a man in my position to feel the public pulse, and treat it as it seems to require;
                              and to that end, of course, it would be absurd to bind one's self."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4370">"It's not the part I care for," interrupted Fanny, still louder. "But I like to see
                              justice, and this is an imposition, and not for the credit of the building with the
                              public."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4373">"This from a girl whom I have puffed into popularity!" muttered the manager. "I don't
                              want to quarrel with a lady," he said aloud, his face flushing somewhat angrily; "but
                              I must trouble you to remember that I am manager in this theatre."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4376">Gail approached the disputants with a resolution that was painfully forced. To cast
                              away a great advantage was an effort; but to disobey her conscience was impossible.
                              She said, briefly, "It seems to me that the part belongs to Miss Ceelems, and therefore
                              it is not right for me to take it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4380">"You can do as you please," said the manager, bluntly, regarding Gail with surprise.
                              "It is a matter of no great importance to us. We are drawing good houses in any case.
                              You play against your own interests, however. The run of a piece like that would be
                              the making of you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4383">"I know that," answered Gail; "but I can't conscientiously take advantage of it."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4386">"Damn!" muttered Mr. Blowper to himself, impatiently. "This is a theatre, I believe,
                              and not a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="124" data-tei-n="246-247"> </a></span> place for preaching. We want no petticoat clergyman here."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4391">"Perhaps," said Gail, making, with an effort, a last appeal, "Miss Ceelems will consent
                              to my playing the part." She turned to her rival, and said, with a mingling of pride
                              and sensitiveness, "It would probably be no loss to you, and, as you must see, an
                              invaluable gain to me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4394">"Upon my soul," said Miss Ceelems, more angrily than she had yet spoken, "your impertinence
                              is uncalled for."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4397">"Now, Fanny," said Mrs. Leamingston, who had entered upon the scene a few moments
                              earlier, and who never stood long under any circumstance without having something
                              to say, "you'll excuse my mentioning it, my dear, but you act very unwisely. Miss
                              Hart speaks like a true lady. If I were in your place, I should only be too happy
                              to oblige her. Besides, you must see that Mr. Lennox is in the right."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4401">"What's the trouble? What's all this about?" said old Harben, nervously, making a
                              sudden pause before the contending parties.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4404">"Damn it! as near as I can judge," said Lennox, "we appear to be rehearsing 'Much
                              Ado about Nothing.'"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4407">"I understood I was engaged here to do leading business," repeated Fanny, sulkily.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4410">"Well, well, well—ain't you?" said Harben. "Isn't she engaged for leading business,

                           <p id="d58070e4413">"Certainly," said Lennox, with a slight laugh. "The lady chooses to consider her rights
                              infringed upon. It does not strike me so. This other lady," explained the manager,
                              "pleased the public so well last night that we judged it best to run the piece. She
                              is new to the stage, and it would be of advantage to her."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4416">"O, it's you, miss—is it?" said Mr. Harben. "You're the lady who gave my wife's maid
                              servant the trouble of washing six extra pocket-handkerchiefs, and gave me the nightmare
                              last night. What do you mean by stepping into other people's leading business, and
                              kicking up such a devil of a row? Do you suppose people want to go to a funeral instead
                              of a play—eh?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4420">Nobody had the heart to laugh except Mrs. Leamingston, who tapped Mr. Harben with
                              her play-book, and said, "O, you droll man!"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4423">"Now, my dear sir," said Mr. Lennox, "there's no interference with the lady's business.
                              Our proposal to run the piece is an entirely different affair, as I have assured her.
                              It is really absurd that a lady of Miss Ceelems' reputation in the profession should
                              think of the matter for a moment. If she<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="125" data-tei-n="248-249"> </a></span> chooses to remain with us for the ensuing season, the same position is open to her."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4428">"There, you hear that—you hear that, marm?" said Harben. "Manager's right there. Miss
                              —— plays for the benefit of the theatre. It's a star engagement, marm."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4431">"I said so—I said so," murmured the prompter to nobody in particular, and tapping
                              his foot impatiently.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4434">"I'm sure," said Fanny, somewhat appeased, and making a virtue of necessity, "the
                              woman's welcome to appear in the part for all me. I only wanted to know if I'd performed
                              my duties here satisfactorily."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4437">"Then I can't see but that we are all right," said Mrs. Leamingston. "I suppose, my
                              dear, you've no scruples against continuing in the piece now?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4441">"Certainly not," responded Gail, with alacrity; "and I don't know that I ever should
                              have had, if I had been better acquainted with the customs of the place."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4444">"She will not play here next season, at all events. I've blocked her game there,"
                              murmured Miss Ceelems.

                           <p id="d58070e4456">JULIE'S merry voice was no longer heard singing over her little dressing-place. The
                              song that had died from her lips had died from her heart also; and in the place of
                              the vain, happy, coquettish light of her eyes, glared the care and hunger of her soul.
                              Her feet no longer tripped over the ghosts' walk as they had done. Her step grew slower
                              day by day. She no longer came to the theatre when she was not required in the piece;
                              and her dress was always plain.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4459">"That young girl is not as pretty as she promised to be," remarked Mrs. Leamingston,
                              looking across the stage to where Julie stood listlessly in the wing. "She is not
                              as plump. She begins to look peaked."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4462">"Perhaps she is ill," suggested Mrs. Wells, "or unhappy."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4466">"Perhaps so," sighed Mrs. Leamingston. "I wonder who she is. I've inquired of several
                              in the building, and no one seems to know."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4471">"I dare say she has reason enough to be secret," insinuated Mrs. Wells. "I was never
                              so much mistaken in a young person in my life. One needn't have their eyes sharpened
                              by their wits to see what's been going on. She makes no secret of that. If she did
                              but know it, she renders herself very annoying to Mr. Lennox."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4474">"Well, now, my dear, do you know," said Mrs. Leamingston, "I've an idea she don't,
                              and that it's as much Tommy's fault as it is hers. Hugh! You don't think she could
                              have heard us?" (A look of trouble had come into the child's face, and she had turned,
                              and walked away.) "I'm sorry for her."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4477">As Julie's step became daily slower, so did the step of the muffled little figure
                              that stole down the archway of the stern old prison Julie had once called her home.
                              It had been many weeks since the figure had sought its old haunt, when, one day, there
                              came to the place, with sad, weary feet, what seemed but the ghost of it. This poor
                              little phantom of Julie was less cautious than the happy child. It had less life to
                              lose. When it arrived at the archway, it hurried, rather than stole, through into
                              the yard, and climbed the trellis as if it were escaping from some invisible pursuer.
                              When the little window had been raised, and Julie stood again in her old room, she
                              forced herself to look about it, and it gave her sore distress. She passed her trembling
                              hand over each dear object, and pressed her cheek against it, and moaned out, "You
                              poor dumb things, I've been afraid to come back and look at you for days and days.
                              If I could only die, and be still, like you. But I can't." Julie walked to and fro,
                              striving to ease the aching of her heart. Her throat was hot and dry, and she could
                              not weep. She stopped for an instant before the bed, and drew from beneath the mattress
                              her father's picture. "O father!" she cried, choking; "if you were only not dead,
                              you would love me, I know; and I'd try to be—" The word Julie would have uttered froze
                              on her lips, and the blood froze in her veins. A heavy hand grasped her wrist, and
                              shook the picture down upon the floor. Without a word Mrs. Mesher led the terrified
                              girl down to the sitting-room, locked the door, and seated herself. The elder Mesher
                              was present, and another. Julie gave one glance at the other figure, and the blood
                              that had been frozen spread itself quickly over her face and arms. It was Fred. She
                              raised her eyes to Mrs. Mesher's face for an instant, with a terrified look of appeal,
                              then dropped them, and again turned white. "What does this mean?" stammered Fred,
                              the expression of his face changing. "Miss Ward, you are in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="127" data-tei-n="252-253"> </a></span> trouble. I hope I am not the occasion. I—I—called—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4482">"Be silent!" said Mrs. Mesher, with severity, "and you shall learn what it means.
                              This guilty woman has been a stranger to me for the past three weeks, and to all respectable
                              society. Remain where you are. It is fit she should have witness to her shame."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4486">Fred seated himself, dumb and at a loss, confused as much by the look he saw in Julie's
                              face as by her step-mother's words. A feeling of angry indignation seemed to crouch
                              within him, ready for a spring. Mrs. Mesher concentrated the force of her rigid, narrow
                              soul into her hard, gray eyes, and fixed them on Julie. In the poor girl's heart,
                              sick with apprehension, was one lingering spark of hope that Mrs. Mesher might not
                              have discovered her love, but only her appearance at the theatre. She dared not ask
                              mercy of the step-mother; but, involuntarily and in silence, she prayed for it. "O
                              God, spare me this blow, and I will hide myself from all human eyes, and die."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4489">There was no malice or mean passion in Mrs. Mesher's eyes—only a pure, heartless sense
                              of duty. While Julie prayed for mercy, Mrs. Mesher prayed also for power to turn a
                              sinful soul from its downward course.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4511">Julie's white lips moved, and formed the words,—</p>

                           <p id="d58070e4520">"Woman, woman!" cried Mrs. Mesher, with a hard, intense fervor in her voice, "cast
                              out of your soul this devil of vanity and lust that blinds. Look at your vile sin
                              in its nakedness, humble yourself in the dust, and pray that the just wrath of the
                              Lord may be averted from your soul, that through Christ's atonement you may become
                              purified. Kneel and kiss the rod in my hands that saves you; for in fasting, prayer,
                              and chastisement shall your shame and vice be branded into your memory, that when
                              you again walk among God-fearing men and women, it shall be with humbled mien."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4524">"Behold, O servant of Satan," murmured Mesher, addressing Fred, "this is, in part,
                              thy work, who first tempted this light and giddy mind into<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="128" data-tei-n="254-255"> </a></span> the house of vanity—the theatre. O, daughter, my heart bleeds for you; prepare your

                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4529">Mesher rose, and was about to approach Julie. Fred felt the blood leap into his veins
                              and tingle in his fingers' ends. He clenched his fists, sprang up, and, with one blow,
                              sent Mesher staggering to the further end of the room. He seized Julie in his arms,
                              and stopped for a moment, breathless and panting with anger.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4532">Mesher's face turned a sickly yellow, and the red spots upon it, caused by too high
                              living, shone out disagreeably plain. He reseated himself, and, with an effort, endeavored
                              to assume his usual meek smile, but without turning unto his enemy his other cheek
                              to be smitten. "Let him," said Fred, when he could force his clenched teeth to move—"let
                              him who is without sin among you cast the first stone."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4535">"We are not here," said Mesher, assuming his unctuous affectation with much difficulty,
                              "to listen to the wisdom of babes and sucklings."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4538">"If you read your Bible," cried Fred, "you will find the words I have spoken in the
                              mouth of Christ. Which are you pleased to term him—a babe or a suckling?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4541">The spots in Mesher's face deepened.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4545">"You are neither of you without sin," cried Fred, his brain on fire with indignation.
                              "You are neither of you guiltless of Julie's 'misfortune. If you hadn't stigmatized
                              every pure and natural appetite as a vanity and a sin, she would have known better
                              what was right and what was wrong. If you hadn't cheated her out of all natural pleasure
                              at home, she would not have sought it elsewhere. If you hadn't turned away every honest
                              lover, she would not have loved a dishonest one."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4548">"Profane not the sacred word 
                              <emph id="d58070e4550">love,</emph>" began Mesher.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4554">But Fred raised his voice, and continued: "If you had shown her a little human love,
                              and allowed her to enjoy a little good, honest, worldly pleasure,—if you had not taught
                              her a religion which makes God hateful rather than lovely—But I don't lay it all to
                              your religion. You are a cruel woman, and I don't need to know Julie's story to know
                              that even if she was herself in fault, she is as good a creation of the Lord as you
                              are; and as for you, you old hypocrite," added Fred, with contempt, "your motives
                              in the matter are almost too contemptible to waste words upon. You wanted to throw
                              Julie into the meanest kind of slavery, because you knew she owned a portion of this
                              house, and you had no objection to getting it away<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="129" data-tei-n="256-257"> </a></span> from her." Fred had spoken with such over-whelming intensity that even Mrs. Mesher
                              was surprised into silence, while Mesher expressed the torture of a shocked soul in
                              a succession of facial contortions.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4559">"Look up, Julie, and don't mind them," said Fred, suddenly choking with a difficulty
                              of utterance he had not experienced in addressing the others. "There's a kinder creed
                              than theirs. It's Christ's, and it's written in the Bible, too, and it's in all human
                              and forgiving hearts." Then Fred drew his breath with an effort, and sobbed out, "O,
                              Julie, if you'll be my wife, I'll say God bless you, for I love you, Julie. I can't
                              help it, and I don't want to. If there's any trespass to be forgiven, I forgive, as
                              I know you would forgive me in the same case. Go home with me. They'll be kind to
                              you there, and we'll begin the world again."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4562">"O Fred, don't! don't! don't!" gasped Julie. "You hurt me worse than they do. O, God
                              bless you, God bless you; but, Fred, I love him. 
                              <emph id="d58070e4564">I do! I do!</emph>"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4568">Fred grew numb and cold again, and then fresh anger filled his mind! "Damn him! I
                              whoever he is," he muttered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4572">Mrs. Mesher arose, unlocked the door, and motioned tioned Fred to be gone. "You are
                              standing between this soul and its salvation," she said.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4575">Fred did not stir. "Simon," continued Mrs. Mesher, with no change in her voice, "it
                              becomes your duty to turn this young man into the street by force."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4578">Simon did not stir.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4581">"You'll not put me out of this house alive," choked Fred, "unless she goes with me;
                              for I would not leave a dog to your tender mercies, much less a human being."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4584">"Let us seek to move the unregenerate heart to a sense of its error by tears and supplications
                              of brotherly love," murmured Mesher, hoarsely. He did not like the look of Fred's
                              powerful frame, and the angry flash in his eye, nor the feeling of his clenched fist,
                              and Fred stood between him and the door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4587">"Don't mind me, Fred," whispered Julie in agony, "but go." She gave a frightened glance
                              about the room, sprang through the open door, and ran, not into the street,—for she
                              fled from Fred also,—but up stairs into her own room, stunned and terrified. Suffocated
                              with shame and grief, she forced her trembling hands to open the window. Then, half
                              throwing herself, she dropped blindly down the trellis, and fled.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4593">Mrs. Mesher did not follow. She deemed Julie still in her power.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4596">Fred, bewildered and still white with anger, cried out, "If there's any law to prevent
                              your cruelty to this helpless girl, you shall be made to feel it."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4599">In the street Fred still lingered about the place, indignant and tossed with horrid
                              fancies concerning Julie's punishment. He made one more effort to rescue her. He slipped
                              down the archway and ascended to her window, too reckless and full of care for any
                              timidity. The room was empty; Julie was either a prisoner, or gone to one whom Fred
                              could not think of without hate and anger.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4602">And all the while that this strife and passion had raged, in these poor human brains,
                              the snow had been falling and hushing the noise and rattle of the city. Fred came
                              forth into the street. The silence touched him, and his heart ached with grief as
                              if love and joy were murdered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4605">This afternoon would be succeeded by the night of Gail's benefit. At the manager's
                              request she continued the play of her debut, Nelly's Fate. The night had come on cold.
                              The light snow of the afternoon had given place to a rough, boisterous wind. It was
                              still snowing; but the snow no longer fell in soft, large flakes, loading with jewelled
                              blossoms every bare-branched tree of the Common mon, to glisten in the gas-light,
                              but in fine, icy needle-points, that pricked the frozen cheeks that faced it. The
                              successful actress had no fear that her reception would be less warm for the cold
                              without. Every seat in the theatre had been sold two days previous, and Gail saw the
                              long line of coaches standing before the main entrance, and the coachmen swinging
                              their arms to keep warm, and heard, over the freezing snow, a muffled sound, and squeak
                              of the wheels of fresh coaches arriving each moment. She hurried along the dark passage,
                              and through the old stage door, glad to feel the warm air, of somewhat doubtful purity,
                              that greeted her inside. She found James rubbing his hands with quiet satisfaction.
                              "A severe night without—is it not, Miss Hart?" he said; "and the theatre is pleasant."
                              James could have warmed himself by a painted fire in his worship of the place. "I
                              pity those who don't have a cheerful place to be in on a night like this," he continued,
                              half aloud and half in meditation, eyeing fondly the broken panes of the little window
                              on high, through which the wind blew sharply.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4609">Gail gave him a pleasant reply, and tripped briskly on her way. As he stood watching
                              her with the peculiar dry zest with which he regarded everything belonging to the
                              building, he murmured,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="260-261"> </a></span> "Ah, that young girl does honor to my recommendation." Indeed, James looked upon
                              Gail as a sort of 
                              <foreign id="d58070e4613" xml:lang="FRA">protégée</foreign> of his. He would say, "Miss Hart is in my confidence, and any communication for her
                              I will deliver with the utmost care;" and to Grail he would say, "If there is anything
                              you require in the building, refer the matter to James Hallman. I will attend personally
                              that you are satisfied."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4617">Crossing the stage, these words fell on Gail's ears from one of the wings—"Disgraceful!
                              She will never come inside this building after to-night."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4620">Gail ascended the stairs to her dressing-room. Mrs. Leamingston and Mrs. Latell had
                              not yet arrived, and the room was dark. She began unfastening her shawl. Something
                              between a moan and a cry greeted her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4623">"Is any one in the room?" she inquired, gently, as she turned up the gas. A little
                              figure sprang from one of the chairs, and would have fled past her, but she detained
                              it.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4626">"Don't go, Julie; stay with me. You are in trouble; perhaps I can help you. You know
                              we are sisters to-night, you and I." Julie wrung her hands. "You don't know, I suppose,"
                              she said. "Nobody's told you that I'm going away to-night, never to come back any
                              more. 
                              <emph id="d58070e4628">He</emph> wants me to. He told them to tell me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4632">"Why, Julie, how's this?" said Gail, pained and shocked.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4636">"I don't know how it happened to be so," answered Julie, her voice dry and husky,
                              and a helpless terror in her eyes. "I didn't want to ask. I didn't dare to. I only
                              came in here because somebody else was in my room this afternoon." Julie slipped past
                              Gail with a mute appeal not to be resisted, and went again to her own room. The gas
                              was not lighted there, and Julie sat in the dark, enduring dumbly the ache in her
                              heart. When she was fleeing along the street, she still clung to her lost love; but
                              when the news of her discharge from the theatre met her, her hope seemed to let go
                              its hold on the things of life, and leave her adrift, with the helplessness of a nature
                              that carries no guide in itself. Now and then she moaned, or cried out faintly, as
                              the outraged love or the terror and agony stirred in her bosom; but her heart had
                              received too severe a shock to be as yet fully conscious of its own injury.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4639">"Why does not Mr. Lennox allow Julie to finish her season here?" inquired Gail of
                              Mrs. Leamingston.

                           <p id="d58070e4642">"Well, my dear," answered Mrs. Leamingston, "I suppose he sees she is ill, and not
                              fit to be in the profession at all."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4647">"The truth of the matter is," said Digby, with sarcasm, "that she's too thin to look
                              well on the stage."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4650">"The plain truth of the matter is," said Mrs. Latell, with emphasis, "that he's tired
                              of seeing her round. He wants to be freer to make love to the other ladies. She haunts
                              him with those great hollow eyes of hers, like a ghost."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4654">Gail hurried her dressing, and went into Julie's room. She had thought of offering
                              the misguided girl kind advice and assistance; but when she lit Julie's gas, and found
                              the child sitting with white lips and a vacant look in her eyes, she sought only to
                              aid and comfort her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4657">"You are not well, Julie," she said. "You are not well at all to-night. Don't try
                              to play. Let me get some one to take you home."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4660">"You can't! you can't!" said Julie, shivering. "There's no home there; and now there's
                              no place anywhere."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4663">"I will tell you what we will do, Julie," said Gail. "You wrap up warm, and sit here,
                              or in the green-room by the fire, and I'll get Mr. Blowper to let one of the others
                              play your part. I'll go now. I won't be gone long. I'll, come again and sit with you."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4666">Julie looked into Gail's face with a sort of frightened, hungry surprise, seized a
                              portion of her dress, pressed it against her cheek, then dropped it restlessly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4669">Gail kneeled down quickly, and drew Julie to her with tears in her eyes. "I'm so sorry
                              things went so bad with you! Never mind now; come home with me after the play. Jennie
                              and I have a nice, cosy little room, and you shall share it with us. You used to belong
                              to us, Julie. You didn't know it, but you were our little princess. That's what we
                              used to call you, because you was so beautiful. Why, you used to be almost like one—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4673">Gail checked herself suddenly, for Julie's head fell forward upon the dressing-place,
                              and she clenched her hands together with a cry, terrified and helpless.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4676">Poor little Julie's soul, rudderless, and drifting out into a black, relentless sea,
                              beheld its own fate, like a cruel jagged rock, against which it must perish.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4679">She set her teeth into her lip remorselessly, then drew her breath, and began to sob
                              and pour out broken words.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4682">"There, there," said Gail, "we can all talk it over, and see what can be done to-morrow.
                              Shall I speak to the prompter now? I won't be gone a minute."
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4687">The poor heart, tossed and tortured as it was, reached out for an instant, and clung
                              to this last fragment of its wrecked life. Julie moaned,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4691">"O, no, no! I want to play it. It's the last time. I didn't mean to cry. I didn't
                              want to before; but you cried, and seemed sorry, and that made me. O, if you would
                              only—You—you—could make him take me back. If you would only ask him—Will you? I mean
                              here at the theatre. You needn't be afraid. I don't want to do wrong. O, I couldn't,
                              and think of Fred; he said something that broke my heart. I only want to stay here."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4694">"Yes, Julie," answered Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4697">"But not right away," sobbed Julie. "By and by, when I tell you."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4700">The girls descended to the stage just in time for the bell. Gail was greeted heartily
                              by the audience, and an exquisite wreath of fresh flowers was handed to her from the
                              orchestra. The gayety and enthusiasm contrasted sadly with her pitying sympathy for
                              poor Julie; but the case was imperative, and she summoned the scenes before her, and
                              abandoned herself to the part. Perhaps, touched by Julie's distress, she played with
                              even more than her wonted truth and naturalness. The audience called her after every
                              act, and the manager, yielding ing to the "magic of success," found her unusually
                              attractive, and exerted his utmost power to render himself agreeable. He made love
                              to the earnest woman in a manner more respectful than he had shown to the trusting
                              child. He stood ready, at each entrance, to receive her flowers, and when it pleased
                              her to go there, to conduct her to the green-room. He was witty, praised her cunningly,
                              and contented himself with such accidental touches of her hand as fell to his lot
                              in the transfer of the bouquets. Once only, tempted by the fine face and graceful
                              dignity of manner, and piqued, perhaps, by her cool self-possession in his presence,
                              he retained the hand, placed his arm about her waist, and whispered, "You surpass
                              all other women in power, and, by my honor, in a year's time you might become the
                              idol of the public, and have society at your feet. For one, I'll own I'm captivated
                              at the start. You excel yourself to-night. You are positively radiant."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4703">"At present," answered Gail, a little angrily, and blushing, "I must trouble you to
                              show me a higher respect than is due to a wooden image, or a doll, by removing your
                              arm from my waist, and honoring me with something besides flattery." Gail uttered
                              these words with an effort; the manager's conduct was embarrassing and painful to
                              her.
                           </p>

                           <p id="d58070e4709">"My dear girl," began Lennox, soothingly, but without removing his arm, "you misunderstand
                              me. I mean—"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4712">"There is no reason why you should misunderstand me," answered Gail, with severity,
                              disengaging herself from the embrace as she spoke.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4715">"Upon my soul," said Lennox, speaking low, and in the same tone, but a trifle crest-fallen
                              and ashamed, "you draw the line pretty close. My interest in you is the purest friendship.
                              You possess genius, and—Well, I have it in my power to aid you. Come now, my dear
                              Miss Hart, why not be friends with me?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4718">Gail, stung to the quick in the keen sense she felt of her outraged dignity, stood
                              apart, and deigned no answer.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4721">"By Jove," thought the manager, "it won't do for a man to say anything besides his
                              prayers in your presence, I see.—Now, for my part," he continued aloud, "I don't see
                              any harm in a little confidence and familiarity between friends; but, 'pon my honor,
                              I don't want to offend. I won't again, I promise you You'll forgive me—won't you?
                              Do! There, give us your hand—unless that sort of thing is on the other side of the
                              line, too. Come!" And Lennox approached Gail, and, bending his face yet closer to
                              hers, whispered some further pleadings in her ear.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4724">Julie saw him; a sickly hope had lingered in her heart, that, as it was the last night,
                              he might have some kind parting word for her; but when she saw his face bent over
                              another, and read in his eyes the old look that had once made her dream his love was
                              true, the poor sore wound in her heart received a new stab, that made it, all unhealed
                              as it was, bleed afresh. She gasped, and pressed her thin hands convulsively together
                              to keep herself from crying out with the pain. She turned away, and crept off among
                              the scenes, sobbing faintly. The pitiful little spark of hope died out, and Julie
                              sat in the obscurity on an old pile of, carpets, rocking herself with a despairing,
                              restless motion, striving to choke down the cruel ache that swelled in her throat.
                              Her short part in the piece was over till the last act. There was nothing to disturb
                              her. The scenes and the hours slipped away. It was cold where she sat; but a fierce
                              fever crept into her chilled blood, and her head dropped heavily against the scene
                              nearest her. She retained only a fitful consciousness of the bitter reality; but the
                              ache remained, and seemed at moments to be no part of herself, but some sick thing
                              she had in her care, and suffered for. At times she still kept up the jogging motion,
                              as if to hush and soothe this thing in pain,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="135" data-tei-n="268-269"> </a></span> and at times dragged it through her weary dreams, and strove to cheer it on the desolate
                              journey the two seemed to be taking together.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4730">When, at last, the fever wore off, Julie fell into a brief sleep. The cold again crept
                              over her, deadening her limbs. From this sleep she rose bewildered and shivering;
                              but the ache in her heart was less. She tried to think, and, little by little, her
                              brain slowly took in the reality, the full bitterness of which her benumbed senses
                              no longer felt. She rose from her seat, came from her place of concealment, and crept
                              up to a window, where a pane of glass had been broken out. She hardly heard the sounds
                              on the stage that had chafed her wound and mocked her trouble.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4733">Something distant and beyond the storm appealed to her, and she strove to recall a
                              time long past—a time that she had walked on the Common, with the stars shining, and
                              the sweet, warm air bringing her dreams of the country. There was no noise, passion,
                              or suffering then.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4736">The wind blew the icy snow into her face and against her thinly-covered shoulders.
                              She raised her little blue hand, and watched the fine flakes fall upon it. They melted
                              slowly, for the hand was hardly less cold.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4739">"Come out of the draught," said one of the scene-shifters shifters, roughly, but not
                              unkindly. "The theatre is no place for you on a night like this. You'd better be at
                              home and in bed." Julie moved slightly, as if the voice annoyed her; but she did not
                              leave the window. The man presently came with a bit of board, and placed it against
                              the broken pane. "Let it be, Morris," said Julie, petulantly. "I want to see the stars
                              shine. The others are too dirty—the whole ones."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4742">"God," responded Morris, "if you can see any stars to-night, your eyes are better
                              than most folks', for it storms like thunder;" and Morris fastened the board in securely.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4745">"It's a going to clear off," sobbed Julie, sensitively, "and it'll be fair weather
                              soon. You might have let it alone, Morris. I'm going home tonight, and it's likely
                              I'll never come back again."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4749">"Here, put yourself inside of this," said Morris, divesting himself of his knit jacket,
                              and wrapping it about the child. "God," he added, aside, "if I had the managing of
                              that manager, he'd get his come-upance, and pretty devilish quick, too."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4752">Gail came up and whispered to Julie, "Shall I speak to him now? It's the last act,
                              and I have a long wait." Gail's breath blew a dying spark of hope back into life for
                              an instant, and a faint color came into Julie's cheek: she glanced nervously<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="136" data-tei-n="270-271"> </a></span> through the wings. The curtain had not yet risen, and Lennox stood on the stage,
                              laughing at the moment, and joking carelessly with a group of the actors. To Julie
                              he looked so handsome and powerful that she turned to Gail with a look of pain in
                              her white, thin face, and said, low, "No, not just now; he is talking with some one,
                              and may not like it: wait a little."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4757">"Why, Julie," said Gail, "you have lost your shawl, and you are shivering with the
                              cold."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4760">Julie had made no effort to keep the jacket about her, and it had fallen to the floor.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4763">"Come with me into the green-room," Gail continued, "and let us sit by the fire. I
                              feel sure all will—" Gail stopped.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4766">"My God," whispered Morris, "take her in your arms, Miss Hart; she's fainting, or
                              dying."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4770">"Who is? What is the matter?" cried voices about Gail; and in an instant there was
                              a hush in the theatre, and a group of blanched faces gathered on the spot. Gail and
                              Mrs. Leamingston carried Julie gently into the green-room. The others followed, awe-struck
                              and terrified.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4773">"Run for the doctor," whispered Mrs. Latell.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4776">"Some one has gone," was answered, in a low tone.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4779">They laid her on a settee, bowed their heads, and watched. No one spoke. No one brought
                              water or restoratives. The change that had crept over the face said too plainly—Death.
                              Gail knelt down trembling, and touched the hand timidly and with reverence; but she
                              dared! not utter the familiar name. A vague sense that she might disturb the soul,
                              perhaps already in the presence of God, or trespass with rude effect on the mystery
                              of death, withheld her.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4782">The first ghastly touch of the destroyer that had brought a look of mortal suffering
                              into the face, as it drew from it all the warm, wonderful beauty of life, was over;
                              and perhaps now the bright children came trooping around, ready to awaken the poor
                              spirit from its tragic earthly dream into a happier world. For all the care and the
                              trouble had faded from the features. Julie had gone home, never more to return. The
                              awed silence that had prevailed was broken by sobs.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4785">Thomas Lennox came forward and looked at the little body whose last breath would have
                              excused and blessed him, and whose last glance had been timid and fearful of him;
                              and it was now his turn to be afraid and to shrink.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4789">The others stepped aside. None looked at him, or spoke; only the sobbing became more
                              audible. He was human, one of them, and they were sorry<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="272-273"> </a></span> for him. Perhaps, too, they felt, and held sacred, the presence of the divine tribunal
                              that had called to the stand the soul whose sufferings might witness against him.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4794">Lennox bowed, and his frame shook with his emotions. The mute face, the longing eyes
                              that would trouble him no more with their too plain-loving glances, the little feet
                              that would no longer stand in his way, the poor life that had been short, and not
                              merry, touched him, and as he turned away, he sobbed out, "When I forget you, Julie,
                              may God forget me."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4797">The men left the room, and the women took the false flowers out of Julie's golden
                              hair, and gently wiped the paint from her cheeks. Gail covered the peasant dress with
                              her shawl, that when the little wearer should be borne from the theatre, no shocked
                              instinct should trespass on kinder thoughts.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4800">Mrs. Leamingston said low, through her weeping, "Dear Julie! she looks as though she
                              had only fallen asleep. She had a sweet, affectionate nature. Don't you think she
                              had?"
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4803">"Yes," answered Gail, crying over the poor little hands that bore the purple marks
                              where Julie had pressed them in her suffering.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4806">When everything had been done that could be done, and Gail and Mrs. Leamingston stood
                              looking at the sleeper in sorrowful silence, the prompter came to the door, and said,
                              gently,—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4810">"Shall we go on with the piece, Miss Hart? I suppose the audience must be satisfied
                              some way."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4813">"Yes," answered Gail. "I shall be there in time."</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4816">The women broke into renewed weeping. To continue the piece at that time seemed to
                              them unkind to poor Julie. Each kissed the forehead, and left the room. Gail covered
                              the face, and retired also, closing the door.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4819">The actresses hushed their crying as best they might, and stood awaiting their cues
                              grouped in one wing; for before the awful mystery of death and hereafter, like children
                              in the dark, they unconsciously drew together, to feel each other's presence. They
                              still spoke low, and even on the stage were not forgetful of the sleep that never
                              could be broken.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4822">Little Sissy Sands had been crouching outside the green-room door, afraid to enter.
                              She crept up now, and pulled Gail by the sleeve. "Say, Miss Hart, won't our Julie
                              go to heaven because she was an actress? She will go there—won't she—say."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4825">"Yes, Sissy."</p>

                           <p id="d58070e4834">"'Ush!" interrupted Mrs. Sands, but not loudly, as was habitual to her. "You 'eed
                              what your Sunday school teacher says; and at the same time, Miss 'Art, you're quite
                              right; and, Sissy, don't you mention Sunday schools 'ere, for, mind you, it's not
                              a fit place."
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4837">"
                              <emph id="d58070e4839">I</emph> loved Julie," said Sissy, with a sigh. "She used to come and sit by me when I was
                              sick, and tell me all about a little mouse she had when she was a little girl; but
                              it made her cry, and say, 'O Sissy, I wish I was a child now.' Do you think, now,
                              that she would go and cry for a mouse that happened so long ago?" added Sissy, pausing
                              suddenly to make the inquiry.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4843">The women glanced at each other.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4846">"God knows how much that poor girl suffered for her fault," Mrs. Latell murmured.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4850">"You went into her room to-night?" whispered Mrs. Leamingston to Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4853">"Yes," replied Gail.</p>
                           
                           <p id="d58070e4856">"I'm glad of that," continued Mrs. Leamingston. "Poor Julie! I don't know what put
                              it out of my head. I had meant to look after the child some. She needed some one."
