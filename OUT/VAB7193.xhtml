                           laurustinus which divides the lawn from the vegetables in this small domain,
                           which has been a garden for two hundred years; nay, for a longer time, for if
                           the dwelling dates, as may be seen by a legible inscription, from the year of
                           the death of Queen Anne, the kitchen and dairy are probably the remains of an
                           Elizabethan cottage; while the pointed tower of the parish church, just piercing
                           above the swathing ivy of the northern wall, is centuries earlier. The
                           foundation stone was laid by St. Anselm.

                        <p id="d45862e546">The twilight falls, the stars come out, the “Great Bear” begins its slow movement
                           upon the darkening sky, and I hear the steps of bygone generations passing up
                           the village street. They come in the costume which Chaucer wore when that old
                           church was new. They come in brown<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="3" data-tei-n="viii"> </a></span> straight
                           gowns and light‐coloured tunics; they come in armour, in peaked hats and in
                           peaked shoes, in gold chains and plentiful embroidery. Some of them are
                           horsemen, and others monks, and there is a fair proportion of hooded goodwives
                           and young maidens. We know that they thus came up the street to hear the news of
                           Agincourt, and again on the day of Bosworth Field, and when Flodden was being
                           fought to the bitter end. Do you hear the echo of the bugle thrown back from the
                           neighbouring down? It means a royal progress—a Henry or an Edward comes to lodge
                           in the monastery hard by. For at the head of the street, in its noble park, was
                           a great monastery, one directly attached to the See of Canterbury. Such
                           ecclesiastical strongholds existed at intervals of twenty miles all the way to
                           the Land’s End. Centuries older than London without the Walls, they were once
                           centres of vivid local life, though now the place thereof may be silent and far
                           from a high road. Such another, and indeed far more obliterated by the dust of
                           time, is Robertsbridge, whose Abbot was sent to find and rescue Cœur de Lion. In
                           this autumn season a garden full of crimson hollyhocks abuts<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="4" data-tei-n="ix"> </a></span> upon the great grey gable of a farm, which can only
                           be reached by a narrow winding lane, and is itself the only remnant of that once
                           famous Abbey of the Rother.

                        <p id="d45862e553">But here, where a stately house has incorporated the monastery, and where village
                           life has never ceased to murmur, all the ground is haunted.

                           </choice> has happened to me to be aware of the faint whispers of old
                           conversations in this garden; the talk of the masons who built successive
                           portions of the dwelling—from those who hoisted up the beam in the dairy when
                           Shakespeare was alive, to those who put in the parlour panels while Marlborough
                           was fighting in Flanders—and the gossip of the women who cooked their dinners in
                           the neighbouring cottages, by fires practically unextinguished from then till
                           now, for as each hearth crumbled by time another was built upon the same place.
                           The contour of the village makes it certain that the ancient cottages stood
                           where the modern ones do now, inheriting the traditions of twenty
                           generations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e564">And I hear yet one other ghostly voice. It is that of a young girl who grew up in
                           the great house 150 years ago; her name was Barbara,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="5" data-tei-n="x"> </a></span> and so far as I know, there exists of her no
                           portrait. In the year 1749 she made a very great marriage. She wedded the son of
                           a famous man who had been executed on Tower Hill three years before, and whose
                           estates had been confiscated to the Crown. Barbara, who survived what brothers
                           and sisters she may have had, remade her husband’s fortunes. The people who
                           lived in this old house were not her tenants; they were farming squires of mild
                           pretension. They had dwelt in Sussex from generation to generation, and when
                           those ghastly executions took place in London the news must have travelled very
                           rapidly down to a house like this. It must have thrilled with horror the family
                           at the great house, who were Catholics, and every detail must have circulated
                           through the village. Sitting in the garden, I have seen the girl come in with
                           her lover, James Bartholomew, a young man of five‐and‐twenty. She wears a
                           sacque; she is dressed like Clarissa Harlowe. He has a coat of coloured silk and
                           a three‐cornered hat. When they are married, the bells of the parish church will
                           ring; and so also for the birth of their one boy, Antony James. Antony<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="6" data-tei-n="xi"> </a></span> James and his august widow carried on the history of

                              fine volume on the “Leaders of Religious Thought in England”; and I turned
                              with natural interest to the essay on George Eliot, who was so intimately
                              known to me through a long series of years, and to the criticism on
                              “Middlemarch” and its heroine, Dorothea Casaubon. And I reflected that, so
                              far as I knew, nearly all the elaborate criticisms on George Eliot’s work
                              had been written by men. Women seem to have held aloof with a sort of fear
                              from any attempt to measure the achievements of that extraordinary mind; and
                              yet neither her ponderous weight of learning, nor the full flow of her
                              thought, nor the

                              members of her own sex with what seemed for a time to be an almost
                              irresistible impact.

                           <p id="d45862e600">There are reasons which make “Middlemarch” especially interesting to me; for
                              it was there that I first saw the writer! It is a much truer book than “Adam
                              Bede”—truer, I mean, to the real conviction of the creating mind. “Adam
                              Bede” is a wonderful 
                              <foreign id="d45862e602" xml:lang="fre">tour de force</foreign>—a
                              painting from knowledge and observation of a group of people known, for the
                              most part, to George Eliot in her youth, and the finest of whom were
                              profoundly moved by convictions on which had ceased to have the slightest
                              hold. During the years when I saw her most intimately, I had with her
                              private conversations, and heard her speak with others in a weighty,
                              thoughtful manner which left not the slightest loophole for the idea that at
                              this period of her life, from 1850 onwards, she retained any faith in
                              Christianity. I think that her unbelief was historical, I had almost said<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="9" data-tei-n="3"> </a></span> mechanical, but it was of the most sincere
                              and absolute kind.

                           <p id="d45862e608">Yet these intellectual conclusions were in singular opposition to the general
                              cast of her character. Born myself in the very bosom of Puritan England, and
                              fed daily upon the strict letter of the Scripture from aged lips which I
                              regarded with profound reverence, I am in a position to declare that, from
                              first to last, George Eliot was the living incarnation of English Dissent.
                              She had “Chapel” written in every line of the thoughtful, somewhat severe,
                              face; not the flourishing Dissent of Spurgeon or Parker, or the florid
                              kindliness of Ward Beecher, or the culture of Stopford Brooke, but the
                              Dissent of Jonathan Edwards, of Philip Henry, of John Wesley as he was
                              ultimately forced to be. Her horror of a lie, her unflinching industry, and
                              sedulous use of all her talents, her extraordinary courage—even her dress,
                              which, spend as she might and ultimately did, could never be lifted into
                              fashion and retained a certain quaint solemnity of cut and gesture like an
                              eighteenth‐century diction applied to clothes—everything about her, to me,
                              suggested<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="10" data-tei-n="4"> </a></span> Bunyan in his Bedford prison,
                              or Mary Bosanquet watched by Fletcher of Madeley as she bore the pelting of
                              the stones in the streets of Northampton. No one has ever before said this,
                              so far as I know; no one has ever attempted to describe her as I saw her in
                              her younger years, but I think I saw the truth. She has been compared
                              personally to Dante and Savonarola. I think that her real affinity may be
                              traced nearer home; that there was in her nothing Italian, nothing in any
                              sense foreign; in the Wars of the Roses her ancestors would have adhered to
                              any leader who promised best for the people; in those of the Commonwealth
                              the brewer of Huntingdon would have commanded them to a man. And precisely
                              in such an atmosphere, except for certain differences of speculative
                              opinion, did I first see George Eliot. Driving from Warwick through the
                              arching elms of that embowered nook of the Shires, with a very dear and
                              gifted companion (a descendant of Oliver Cromwell), we reached Coventry, and
                              Rose Bank, the house of Mr. Charles Bray. It lay on the outskirts of that
                              provincial town which has been rendered doubly famous by George<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="11" data-tei-n="5"> </a></span> Eliot’s life and letters, and is at least the
                              suggestion of the Middlemarch of her dream. There, being at the time myself
                              just one and twenty, I was taken to make the acquaintance of the very
                              learned scholar, Miss Evans. Not Abelard in all his glory, not the veritable
                              Isaac Casaubon of French Huguenot fame, not Spinosa in Holland or Porson in
                              England, seemed to my young imagination more astonishing than this woman,
                              herself not far removed from youth, who knew a bewildering number of learned
                              and modern languages, and wrote articles in a first‐class quarterly.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e615">I remember the scene vividly, though, unfortunately, after so long an
                              interval of time, I can remember none of the conversation. George Eliot had
                              a bad headache, and received us kindly and politely, but with an air of
                              resigned fatigue, Mr. Bray himself was a great talker; always full of ideas,
                              somewhat vigorously expressed. I do not remember that Miss Evans said any
                              noteworthy thing, but I looked at her reverently, and noticed her
                              extraordinary quantity of beautiful brown hair (always to the last a great
                              charm), and that we all went out and stood on a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="12" data-tei-n="6"> </a></span> sort of little terrace at the end of the garden,
                              to see the sunset, and that the light fell full on her head and was
                              reflected from her kind blue eyes. And as night fell, my companion and I
                              were driven back to Warwick, and I did not see the learned scholar again
                              till the next year in London, the year 1851.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e621">And so it came to pass that when “Middlemarch” was published, many years
                              after, the place seemed familiar to me, and Dorothea stood beneath elms with
                              the sunset falling upon her hair, and that she has always been to me most
                              real, though I cannot but think most unreasonable in her misuse of life. The
                              
                              <emph id="d45862e623">girl</emph> is real enough; it is her chances which she and her
                              biographer seem to me to have singularly missed, probably because the very
                              weight and worth of English Dissenters forty to fifty years ago secluded
                              them from all society but their own. From the aristocracy and from the
                              wealthy landed gentry they were absolutely cut off. 
                              <emph id="d45862e626">They</emph> never

                              was only that and nothing more, whatever her abilities or her place in the
                              world. The old scandals of the pre‐Victorian Court, the occasional trials
                              before the Lords, the wine and the whisky of the political dinner, the
                              hunting pastor who strolled into his wife’s bedroom in pink, cracking his
                              whip as he bent to kiss his new‐born child—all these things were as far from
                              the horizon of the Dissenters then as they are from ours now, and farther.
                              But it was not wholly gain; some things were missed which might well be
                              totted up on the other side. The wide political skyline, the knowledge of
                              foreign countries, of the embassies and the diplomatic services, the
                              unbroken links with the older Roman Catholic families—Howards, Talbots,
                              Petres, Arundels, Welds—and the stirrings of the new life among the Catholic
                              converts; add to these the traditions of the stage, the Kembles and the
                              Keans, Garrick’s widow only lately dead (she survived her husband for nearly
                              fifty years); add to these whatever life remained in the English Church, a
                              life soon to re‐blossom like the rose; and it must, I think, be

                              fixed which can only be measured from where we now stand, when the lines of

                           <p id="d45862e646">George Eliot, I think, places her story just before the passing of the Reform
                              Bill, a period which in Warwickshire brought out the sharpest contrasts
                              between the classes. Radical Birmingham was with difficulty kept from
                              rising, and when the one vote carried the Bill, a gentleman—my father—drove
                              at a gallop through the night in one of Lord Grey’s carriages and brought
                              the first news to the “Metropolis of the Midlands.” Ah! those were days when
                              the telegraph and the railroad were alike unknown. Great affairs of State
                              were swung off by signal from the huge arms of the great machine on the roof
                              of the Admiralty, and were repeated from the Telegraph Hill at Hampstead to
                              Harrow, and far across to the north or south, as the case<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="15" data-tei-n="9"> </a></span> might be. But for any other sort of news we
                              galloped through the night. The landed gentry were ensconced in their parks,
                              and the one family with which George Eliot’s father was locally connected
                              paid ninepence, as did all the rest of the world, for their letters—unless
                              they obtained franks, as was probable. Strange antique world, that I, though
                              not yet very old, can faintly remember. The coaches with four horses and a
                              horn which stopped at the Mitre Inn in Oxford; the post‐chaises and their
                              relays which, perchance, as happened to one of ours, were wrecked against
                              carts at two o’clock in the morning, to the great danger of life and limb;
                              and for foreign parts the travelling carriage shipped at Dover, and thence
                              rumbling all over the Continent, exactly as if the inmates were Horace
                              Walpole or Lord Chesterfield doing the grand tour; such were our
                              conveyances.

                           <p id="d45862e654">Such being the outer world into which Dorothea Casaubon was born, George
                              Eliot formed the opinion that her moral chances were<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="16" data-tei-n="10"> </a></span> very poor indeed. And yet, strange to say, at
                              that very time, and in that very circle wherein is laid the beautiful drama
                              of Mr. Gilfil’s love‐story, a girl was actually born who has proved to be
                              one of the principal, and certainly one of the most really efficient,
                              workers of modern times. It has always seemed to me a curious irony of
                              literary fate which made her create a Dorothea in Warwickshire, in Coventry,
                              in the very class, almost in the very family, in which Mr. Newdigate’s
                              energetic cousin was born!
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e659">Dorothea, then, starts with more than average intelligence; thirty years
                              later than Jane Austen’s heroine, delightful Elizabeth Bennet; and so far
                              touched with the modern spirit that she burns with desire to do good, which,
                              oddly enough, is inspired by the example of St. Theresa. Now, St. Theresa
                              was a cloistered nun (George Eliot, be it noted, had an early attraction to
                              Spain), and her work was not outwardly practical, but spiritual. Its
                              efficacy entirely depended upon the validity of certain alleged facts in
                              regard to prayer and a personal relation to an unseen Christ. The undeniable
                              continuity of St. Theresa’s work, which subsists<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="17" data-tei-n="11"> </a></span> to this day in full swing and efficacy, is one of
                              the proofs, patent to all, of the deep root of this kind of faith in human
                              nature; but as it was a faith which George Eliot wholly denied, and of which
                              there is no sign of her heroine having in any way partaken, it is singular
                              that so powerful and well‐cultivated an intellect should have chosen the
                              Spanish nun, dead three hundred years ago, as a constraining example. I have
                              never been able to understand in what way St. Theresa impressed Dorothea
                              Casaubon, nor why she wanted to resemble the saint. The foundress of some
                              active order would have seemed more to the purpose.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e664">Also, in regard to Dorothea’s marriage, her point of view is, to me,
                              inexplicable. To marry for money or position may be wrong, to marry for
                              pity, or for usefulness, or religion, may be foolish and dangerous; but to
                              marry that you may help a man to finish a big book, even were it the
                              all‐embracing Code Napoléon, seems to me to be an inconceivable reason. So
                              far had I written, when, on reading the last sentence to a young friend, she
                              answered, quick as lightning: “Ah, well, then, 
                              <emph id="d45862e666">I</emph> understand
                              it.” I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="18" data-tei-n="12"> </a></span> bow submissive; I feel bound to give
                              the emendation—only remarking that it does not seem to me to partake of that
                              touch of nature which makes the whole world kin.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e672">In truth, “Middlemarch” is to me as a landscape seen in the twilight;
                              
                              <foreign id="d45862e674" xml:lang="fre">au teint grisâtre</foreign>. It is from first to
                              last the plaint of a lost ideal. I do not think it even a true rendering of
                              life as it was lived in England sixty years ago. It would be easy to account
                              for this by saying that the writer had lost “the wider hope.” I prefer not
                              to do it. Such an explanation is, indeed, so far obviously true as that in a
                              country town the most strenuous belief, the most unflagging work, is
                              religious. But the scepticism of “Middlemarch” also extends to things social
                              and human; although at the very time there were forces stirring in England
                              which were about to transform the era of the first gentleman in Europe into
                              that of the Queen and Prince Albert. Surely a notable change.

                           <p id="d45862e679">I understand the opening of the story to be about the year 1828, and Dorothea
                              to be about ten years older than George Eliot herself. I have touched on the
                              outward aspect of the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="19" data-tei-n="13"> </a></span> England of my own
                              birth; let us see wherein lay the hopeful germs of the future. In 1828 Miss
                              Nightingale was a little student, and Mrs. Fry was a mature woman. Mrs.
                              Fanny Kemble was a bright girl of twenty; two years later she was acting in
                              Birmingham, and impressing her vivid personality on my father’s
                              household—sitting on the hearth, and playing with the youngest child. In the
                              upper sphere of all, the Duchess of Kent was doing her utmost to bring up
                              fitly that young daughter of nine years old, on whose character hung much of
                              the future of England and her colonies. In politics, Grey and Brougham were
                              fighting hard battles with the Tories, and the elder Mill and the young
                              D’Israeli, and another youth, named William Gladstone, were alive in the
                              world of letters, or preparing for the fray. Mr. Newman and Mr. Manning were
                              preparing as hard‐working young clergymen. A friend of mine remembers to
                              this day how great a pleasure it was when young Mr. Manning came over to
                              Midhurst, carrying a black bag with his sermon. In Birmingham, two eminent
                              doctors—De Lys, the Frenchman, and Joseph Hodgson, Sir Robert Peel’s
                              friend—<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="20" data-tei-n="14"> </a></span> were the local Lydgates. The
                              air was trembling with scientific discovery; the railroad and the steamboat
                              were invented, though the former was not yet in use; the photographic plates
                              of the Lunar Society lay hidden in a cupboard, and there had lain for thirty
                              years; but the

                              </bibl>, parent of the modern press, with
                              its extraordinary wood‐cuts, which cost such a mint of money, was just about
                              to start (its first cut was, I believe, the Dresden Madonna). Harriet
                              Martineau had begun to write, and Mrs. Barbauld had left off. Mrs. Siddons
                              was lately dead, her statue was not yet in Westminster Abbey. Princess
                              Lieven was writing to Earl Grey; and Lady Morgan, in white satin, was
                              stirring up any metropolis wherein she might happen to be with Sir Charles.
                              Surely a bright, eager England of blue and green coats with gilt buttons; of
                              white muslin frocks and hair twisted over high combs; an England full of the
                              last speech and the last sermon; not so very long before “Tract 90.” And all
                              the innumerable ladies of the landed classes whom we, with our own eyes,
                              have during the last forty years seen travelling,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="21" data-tei-n="15"> </a></span> painting, writing, and serving on committees,
                              were little girls at their mothers’ knees, like that little Princess who was
                              dutifully to grow up and do heavy work as private secretary to England for
                              fifty‐eight years! And into this England was Dorothea Brooke born, with no
                              sort of need, it seems to me, to wish to imitate St. Theresa. We have one or
                              two saints of the world who would have suited her better as a model! Surely,
                              surely, no young woman born in the Shires, however “unked” she might feel at
                              times, had any cause to marry Mr. Casaubon’s big book or Will Ladislaw’s
                              unworthy personality. No, no, Dorothea! I am obliged to admit and believe
                              that you were a real person, but you will never persuade me that you might
                              not have done better in every sense of the word!

                           <p id="d45862e698">My younger public, having read the foregoing pages, assure me that I have not
                              given a sufficient description of George Eliot herself. One of them even
                              says, “You have opened a door and shut it in our faces,” adding that, as I
                              had known her so well, I must have something<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="22" data-tei-n="16"> </a></span> more to say of the most remarkable woman of my generation. And indeed it
                              requires touch upon touch to render such a personality living to those who
                              never saw her, for her power was in some sense a veiled one. In the first
                              place, none of her portraits appear to me to be like her. The one in a
                              hooded bonnet, said to have been sketched in St. James’s Hall, is a
                              monstrous caricature and accidental impression of her face, which was
                              neither harsh nor masculine. The one which prefaces her life is too
                              sentimental. The early photograph, on sale at Spooner’s in the Strand, is
                              very like, but not favourable, and absolutely without any art in the
                              arrangement. It is, however, the only real indication left to us of the true
                              shape of the head, and of George Eliot’s smile and general bearing. In daily
                              life the brow, the blue eyes, and the upper part of the face had a great
                              charm. The lower half was disproportionately long. Abundant brown hair
                              framed a countenance which was certainly not in any sense unpleasing, noble
                              in its general outline, and very sweet and kind in expression. Her height
                              was good, her figure remarkably supple; at moments it had an almost
                              serpentine<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="23" data-tei-n="17"> </a></span> grace. Her characteristic
                              bearing suggested fatigue; perhaps, even as a girl, she would hardly have
                              been animated; but when she was amused her eyes filled with laughter. She
                              did not look young when I first saw her, and I have no recollection of her
                              ever looking much older.

                           <p id="d45862e705">The effect of her presence—it was peculiarly impressive. Her great weight of
                              intellect told in all circles. My father was much attached to her, and
                              whenever any special celebrity was invited to dinner, such as Thackeray,
                              Grote the historian, or old Mr. Warburton (one of the principal founders of
                              the London University), he was never content unless he had also secured his
                              young countrywoman, Marian Evans, for he himself was a Warwickshire man. On
                              these occasions, from 1851 to 1855, she used to wear black velvet, then
                              seldom adopted by unmarried ladies. I can see her descending the great
                              staircase of our house in Savile Row (afterwards the Stafford Club), on my
                              father’s arm, the only lady, except my mother, among the group of remarkable
                              men, politicians, and authors of the first literary rank. She would talk and
                              laugh softly, and look up into my father’s face

                                    of the bright hall‐lamp shone on the waving masses of her hair, and
                                    the black velvet fell in folds about her feet. But for the
                                    deliberate casting away of her social chances when she left for
                                    Germany with Mr. Lewes, she would undoubtedly have achieved a very
                                    great position in the London world quite independently of her
                                    novels. In those years not a soul suspected her of a tinge of
                                    imaginative power. A real, deep thought and quiet wit were the
                                    characteristics of her talk. Most interesting as it was, I should
                                    hesitate to call it charming. There was always a want of brightness
                                    in her conversation. Her nature smouldered deeply, and occasionally
                                    glowed with interior fire; to the outward eye it never burst into a
                                    quick flame.

                           <p id="d45862e718">The story of George Eliot’s life having been fully told in her own letters,
                              the chief question which I can be supposed in any way to answer is: “Why did
                              she act as she did in the principal relation of her life?” I do not know
                              that any sufficient explanation can be given of the reason of human
                              inconsistency. She was the very last woman in England of whom such a step
                              could<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="25" data-tei-n="19"> </a></span> have been prophesied. She
                              certainly was in all her bearing grave, sincere, and of a sort of provincial
                              reticence. In principle she was a strict monogamist, witness the testimony
                              of all her books; and in every relation of life she placed an immense value
                              upon the virtue of faithfulness. You could not be with her and not recognize
                              that her Yea was yea and that her Nay was nay. But she probably believed,
                              though she would hardly have allowed it in words, written or spoken, in a
                              sliding scale of action; by which I mean that she considered a man or a
                              woman justified, on rare occasions, in taking circumstances into account.
                              Mr. Lewes’s home having been broken up by causes of which I conclude that
                              she held him innocent, George Eliot must have thought that he was justified
                              in forming another tie. I do not think that she would have accepted a light
                              excuse, but it is quite evident that her moral judgment accepted what she
                              herself regarded as a grave one; and I can only say, as a Catholic, that I
                              do not expect people who are not Catholics to think and act as if they were
                              such. It is a distinguishing mark of the Roman Church that she speaks
                              with<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="26" data-tei-n="20"> </a></span> authority on this matter,
                              independent of what may be called local arguments. She does not leave the
                              conduct of life in the grave matter of marriage dependent upon the judgment
                              of interested parties, but it is surely unreasonable to expect that a woman
                              whose intellect had totally rejected Christianity in any form should have
                              held Mr. Lewes unable to contract what she undoubtedly regarded as a second
                              marriage. He was at the time very ill, threatened with softening of the
                              brain from overwork and worry, and she went with him to Germany and nursed
                              him into convalescence; being herself independent in means and of a worldly
                              position hitherto high and secure. Surely only those who hold the
                              sacramental view of marriage would have had a right to condemn her, and
                              their condemnation would fall nearer the source of the error—on the fatal
                              facility with which, years earlier, she had suffered her spiritual nature to
                              be swept bare. But it behoves us to speak with pain and hesitation of so
                              deep a problem as the responsibility of an individual soul before God. The
                              example was very unfortunate, and was one of many causes which have<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="27" data-tei-n="21"> </a></span> deeply shaken the old respect for the
                              marriage law in England; and she herself, strangely, lost no opportunity of
                              saying, by pen and speech: “Do not follow my path in life.” At the time of
                              her very sudden and untimely death, her mind was, I think, slowly reverting
                              to some measure of faith—at least, if we may judge by the indications of
                              “Daniel Deronda.” Happier and more normal circumstances, into which she had
                              entered, might have helped that great mind to have regained its freedom of
                              poise, her sense of loyalty being no longer engaged upon the side of
                              wrong.

                           <p id="d45862e727">And this brings me to the one mystery which I have ever felt quite unable to
                              solve. That George Eliot should have chosen her own path and created in her
                              own mind a moral code which covered her action—that I can understand. It
                              would be unjust to judge her by a Christian law which she repudiated. But
                              why, in the exercise of this amount of moral liberty, she should have
                              idealized and finally almost worshipped Mr. Lewes, is one of those problems
                              before which those who know the inner wheels of London life in the Fifties
                              may well stand confounded. On<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="28" data-tei-n="22"> </a></span> the
                              manuscripts now deposited in the British Museum she has left an imperishable
                              testimony to her conception of his worth. The dedications “to my dear and
                              ever dearer husband” rise in a pathetic 
                              <foreign id="d45862e731" xml:lang="ita">crescendo</foreign> of affection and esteem. I had myself at any time
                              but an external acquaintance with Mr. Lewes, never having seen him until the
                              return of George Eliot from Germany. I had been aware of her intention for
                              some weeks before she went away. She told me of it during a long walk round
                              Hyde Park. Needless to say, that I heard her with a sinking heart, and that
                              remonstrance was practically impossible. That conversation seems to me,
                              after a lapse of nearly forty years, to be printed on the very stones of
                              Park Lane. When, after many months, she returned to London, I sought her out
                              with anxious affection. I then saw Mr. Lewes for the first time. And during
                              the long years of their union I saw him occasionally in the drawing‐rooms of
                              their various homes. My domestic circumstances withdrew me from George
                              Eliot’s sphere, but the inward tie was never broken. I was, I believe,
                              almost the last person to whom she wrote before her sudden death, after four
                              days’<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="29" data-tei-n="23"> </a></span> illness; and I was, perhaps, the
                              first to whom the most unexpected event was communicated by letter, with a
                              request that I would break the intelligence to Madame Bodichon, our close
                              friend.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e738">Since, then, my personal knowledge of Mr. Lewes was comparatively slight, I
                              refrain from any observations on him. The impression he made on his
                              contemporaries has been recorded by several among them. There is no real
                              difference in the portraits drawn by Mr. L’Espinasse and Mrs. Lynn Linton,
                              by Carlyle himself and by Mrs. Carlyle in her letters. The acute and
                              brilliant side of his mind is shown in his books, biographical and
                              philosophical. They are delightful reading if not very profound. His moral
                              ideas he has told in “Rose, Blanche, and Violet.” I would add that I believe
                              him to have been very kind and helpful in domestic life. But there will come
                              a time when no care for the living and no respectful reticence with regard
                              to the dead, will check the publication of contemporary diaries and private
                              letters. It is because I see plain signs of that time approaching, that I
                              wish to place on record the exact truth of my<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="30" data-tei-n="24"> </a></span> conception of George Eliot’s character. It must be borne in mind that to
                              her Mr. Lewes seemed true and reverent. She must have evolved some better
                              self than that perceived by the outer world.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e743">I will say in conclusion that I know she loved much, not only the one to whom
                              she gave faithful years of devoted care, but his children, whom she educated
                              and made her own, the friends of her youth, the poor, the sick, and the
                              suffering. She apparently regarded the Christian controversy as relegated to
                              the region of dead intellectual lumber; yet it is true of her, as of all of
                              us, that to our own Master we must stand or fall. To Him I leave my dead
                              friend.

                           <hi id="d45862e757">NINETY</hi> years have passed since Dr. Joseph Priestley died at
                           Northumberland in Pennsylvania. He is buried there with his wife and youngest
                           son, Henry, and one by one a group of American descendants have been gathered to
                           his side in that simple graveyard. With his scientific achievements I am
                           incompetent to deal; but it seems to me that his reputation is not lessened by
                           the lapse of years. He had the divining intellect which suggested even more than
                           it achieved. He told to his contemporaries his successes, and even his mistakes,
                           with the eager simplicity of a child of genius. His statue, modelled from
                           Fuseli’s portrait, was placed in the Oxford Museum by a committee co‐operating
                           with Prince Albert; his name figures on the great frieze surrounding the Palais
                           d’Industrie in the Champs Elysées; and Birmingham erected<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="32" data-tei-n="26"> </a></span> a statue to him in 1874, the centenary of the

                        <p id="d45862e763">When this statue was inaugurated, my mother, who was born in Pennsylvania, was
                           probably the only person living in England who could personally recall Joseph
                           Priestley. She was seven years old when he died. He had taught her to read, and
                           her memory of him remained perfectly clear and vivid. The delicate features of
                           the old man, framed in thin locks of silvery hair, are recorded in the portrait
                           by Artaud before me as I write. This presentment, rather than any of those by
                           Flaxman, is what my mother affirmed to be the real grandfather she remembered.
                           It may not be without interest to try and recover some traits of the man as he
                           was, according to the last echo of oral tradition. Also to this end indirect
                           help is given by a record which he left of his private life, an old‐fashioned
                           reticent autobiography, which, though several times reprinted, is hardly known
                           in general literature, because it is filled from cover to cover, not with
                           records of the scientific discoveries which were making him famous from one end
                           of Europe to the other, but with thoughts and

                           wrestled single‐handed, if by any means he might wring out the truth of things
                           divine. He scarcely takes the trouble to note those experiments on electricity,
                           gas, and water which earned for him, even in his own lifetime, the recognition
                           of the civilized world. To this autobiography his eldest son appended a
                           supplementary chapter recording the last years and peaceful death‐bed, at which
                           even the little grandchildren were present.

                        <p id="d45862e789">It can, however, be supplemented from other sources. Priestley made a great
                           impression upon his contemporaries, as is witnessed by the extraordinary number
                           of portraits and medallions executed in his lifetime; nor did the political
                           caricaturists spare him. Moreover, the dignified household, marked by plain
                           living and high thinking, and at all times poor in worldly goods, became the
                           centre of a very whirlpool. The<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="35" data-tei-n="29"> </a></span> Birmingham
                           riots raged round Priestley and his friends, and were full of ferocious passion,
                           full also of incident, and of that strange blending of the sublime and the
                           commonplace in which lies the deepest pathos. We have many letters recounting
                           how people lost their property, their loose coin, their keys, and their clothes,
                           as well as precious papers. We are told how the young people of Priestley’s
                           congregation, Mary R. and Sarah S. and their brothers, were hurried away along
                           the country roads by their frightened parents, the mob roaring and racing a mile
                           or two behind; and one of the girls afterwards wrote the best account we have of
                           those four days. In the midst of the turmoil stood Priestley, calm and patient,
                           forbidding the young men of his congregation to strike a blow. In the letters of
                           his contemporaries, rather than in any documents furnished by himself, we must
                           seek for the man.

                        <p id="d45862e794">He was born in Yorkshire, of an old Presbyterian stock; one branch of the family
                           acquired wealth and lived at Whiteways, but his own immediate ancestors were
                           farmers and clothiers, people of substance in the yeoman class. We<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="36" data-tei-n="30"> </a></span> can trace them accurately as far back as the middle
                           of the seventeenth century, when one Phœbe Priestley, after wrestling with fever
                           in her household, was herself stricken and “lay like a lamb before the Lord” on
                           her death‐bed. Her husband wrote a long and touching account of all she said and
                           did, that her children might know what manner of mother they had lost. These
                           people were presumably of the same stock as the Priestleys of Soylands, who run
                           back into the Middle Ages.

                        <p id="d45862e799">The children of the Priestley families were all named after Scriptural
                           characters. They were Josephs, Timothys, and Sarahs from one generation to
                           another. The Bible was stamped into them, and from it they drew all the
                           inspiration of their lives. That gifted Joseph, who was to make so singular an
                           impression on his time, and to be associated with Shelburne and Sandwich, with
                           Captain Cook, D’Alembert, and Diderot, and to receive honours from the Empress
                           Catherine of Russia, was born on March 13th (old style) in the year 1733, at
                           Fieldhead, a small stone house about six miles south‐west of Leeds. It is now
                           taken down, but I visited it<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="37" data-tei-n="31"> </a></span> in my youth, and
                           made a rough sketch, which shows that it was rather smaller than the house of
                           Shakespeare’s birth at Stratford‐on‐Avon, but of much the same type, and
                           probably very ancient. The front door led into the house‐place; a division had
                           been made to accommodate two families, but originally, one hundred and sixty
                           years ago, it would have been a solid and respectable homestead, and fifty years
                           later we find Priestley writing to his sister, Mrs. Crouch, at the address of
                           Fieldhead.

                           not fail to do, with the clear idea of the distinction of property, and of the
                           importance of attending to it. She died in the hard winter of 1739, not long
                           after being delivered of my youngest brother, and is said to have dreamed a
                           little before her death that she was in a delightful place which she
                           particularly described, and imagined to be heaven. The last words which she
                           spoke, as my aunt informed me, were: ‘Let me go to that fine place.’”

                        <p id="d45862e816">The boy’s life now underwent a radical change. On his mother’s death he was taken
                           home, the next brother replacing him in the farmer’s household, and before long
                           a sister of his father’s, married to a wealthy man of the name of Keighley,
                           offered to adopt and consider him as her own child. This was when Priestley was
                           nine years old, and for twenty years Mrs. Keighley survived and kept her
                           promise. Her husband, “remarkable for piety and for public<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="39" data-tei-n="33"> </a></span> spirit,” died soon after the adoption of the child,
                           leaving the greater part of his fortune to the widow, and much of it at her
                           disposal after her death. From this time forward the boy had every advantage of
                           education so far as it could be obtained at a time when the Universities of
                           Oxford and Cambridge were strictly closed to Dissenters. He was well instructed
                           in the learned languages, of which he says he had acquired a pretty good
                           knowledge at the age of sixteen.

                           into her views; but becoming, as it was thought, consumptive, he took another
                           great intellectual start. The dead languages were laid aside, and with a view to
                           a mercantile situation the youth learned three modern languages—French, Italian,
                           and High Dutch, all without a master—and in the first and last, says he, “I
                           translated and wrote letters for an uncle of mine who was a merchant, and who
                           intended to put me into a counting‐house at Lisbon. A house was actually engaged
                           to receive me there, and everything was nearly ready for my undertaking the
                           voyage.”<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="40" data-tei-n="34"> </a></span> But the patient’s health improved,

                        <p id="d45862e826">Priestley, therefore, resumed his theological studies, and in due time was
                           ordained minister; and being a man of great though unconscious ability, wholly
                           free from exaggeration of language, he has drawn a picture of the life led in
                           Yorkshire by Presbyterian divines which must impress the modern reader with
                           astonishment, and perhaps with admiration. No hermits of the desert, no monks of
                           La Trappe, dwelt more serenely in an atmosphere apart. It was the time of Louis
                           the Fifteenth in France and of George the Second in England, and the nephews and
                           nieces of Charlotte Princess Palatine were still living, and her letters, whose
                           name is legion, yet lay stored in the cabinets of her correspondents, full of
                           inexpressible details discussed in most expressive language. It was the time
                           when Jeanie Deans walked from Scotland to beg her sister’s life of Queen
                           Caroline, and met Madge Wildfire in the way. It was the time when the polite
                           world was composed of “men, women, and Herveys”; when Squire Pendarves was found
                           dead in his bed in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="41" data-tei-n="35"> </a></span> Greek Street, Soho, leaving
                           his young widow to be courted by John Wesley and wedded by Dr. Delany; when
                           statesmen bribed, and young blades drank, and Sir Harbottle carried off Harriet
                           Byron, whose shrieks brought Sir Charles Grandison to the rescue, sword in hand.
                           It was the period when the Jacobite Rebellion flamed up and expired, when the
                           Young Pretender marched to Derby, and the heads of the decapitated lords were
                           exposed on Temple Bar; tragedies, agonies, highway robberies,—Dick Turpin, Jack
                           Sheppard, smugglers, the press gang;—Frederick Prince of Wales quarrelling in
                           Leicester Square, Queen Caroline on her death‐bed telling her weeping little
                           George “que l’un n’empêche pas l’autre,” Horace Walpole making the grand tour,
                           Dean Swift dying in agonized misery. Merciful heavens! what an England, of which
                           we possess the daily diary! We can see Hogarth at his easel, and Sir Joshua
                           taking his first stiff portraits, and Garrick going on pilgrimage to Stratford,
                           and the young king courting Hannah Lightfoot and marrying his little bride from
                           Mecklenburg. Without too much verifying of dates, it is<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="42" data-tei-n="36"> </a></span> certain that all this was happening before Dr.
                           Priestley was thirty years of age, and that of none of it is there the faintest
                           mention in the account he has drawn up of his own childhood, youth, and young
                           manhood, though he was himself destined to be one of the principal illustrations
                           of the Georgian era. For anything which appears to the contrary, he and his
                           friends might have dwelt in some far serene planet, whose inhabitants were
                           wholly given up to study and to prayer. The tutors and students of Warrington
                           Academy bestowed their whole minds (and very good minds) on the classics, the
                           mathematics and metaphysics, and most of all on the theological discussions upon
                           freewill and necessity, on the exact attributes of the Logos, and the exact
                           results of the Atonement. Keenly alive to the immortal interests of man, the
                           actual world touched them not. Much must be allowed to the absence of
                           newspapers, to the want of easy communication. The men of the North who did not
                           live with their bottle lived with their book; but it does seem strange that
                           forty years later, when writing or revising his own story, Priestley, become in
                           a sense a man of the world,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="43" data-tei-n="37"> </a></span> should not recall
                           of those exciting times a single letter; a single speech. Still stranger perhaps
                           is it to note that though during his last years Europe still lay bleeding, he
                           added no word on the great convulsion, nor upon the rise of Buonaparte; except
                           in occasional notices in his private letters, he scarcely makes reference to the
                           French Revolution.<a href="#belloc-walled01" class="ref-note">¹</a> It is impossible to
                           doubt that all its details became gradually known to him, but it is the literal
                           truth that his interests lay “otherwhere.” People now talk of true
                           inwardness—such inwardness as Priestley’s was really a “recollectedness” of the
                           most singular kind, and it largely accounts for the extraordinary personal
                           influence he possessed. He impressed those about him as a being from another
                           sphere; of this there are many traces. Yet his own life was really one of the
                           first to be swept into the vortex. When Harry Priestley rushed into the great
                           drawing‐room at Barr to tell the Galtons that the Bastille was down, it meant
                           for the boy and his family flaming destruction and exile, and in his own case an

                           a pupil to the Academy at Daventry, where he remained for three years under a
                           successor of Dr. Doddridge. The new student felt “that peculiar satisfaction
                           with which young persons of generous minds usually go through a course of
                           liberal study in the society of others engaged in the same pursuits, and free
                           from the cares and anxieties which seldom fail to lay hold on them when they
                           come out into the world.”

                        <p id="d45862e845">The endless discussions of these young persons need not be here analyzed, though
                           they are most curious and interesting. They are accessible in print. In three
                           years Priestley obtained a small appointment as minister at Needham Market, in
                           Suffolk, and seems to have been pleased to get it. His congregation numbered
                           about one hundred, and the salary did not even amount to the now classical forty
                           pounds a year. The young man lived very meagrely. His rich aunt, Mrs. Keighley,
                           had been displeased at his theological opinions, and she had taken a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="45" data-tei-n="39"> </a></span> deformed niece into her charge, who ultimately
                           inherited all she had to bequeath. His aunt had always assured him that she
                           would leave him independent of his profession, but he was “satisfied that she
                           was no longer able to perform her promise,” and freely consented to the money
                           being left to his deformed cousin. His aunt finally bequeathed him a silver
                           tankard, and he remarks, “She has spared no expense in my education, and that
                           was doing more for me than giving me an estate.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e851">In 1758 he left Needham, going to London by sea to save expense, and from thence
                           to Nantwich, in Cheshire, where he had an offer from a congregation, and where
                           he opened a school for about thirty boys, with a separate room for half a dozen
                           young ladies. Priestley at all times gave his best mind to the teaching of
                           girls, and shows by many incidental words that he held women in as high mental
                           and moral estimation as men; and he does this quite simply, and with no idea of
                           propounding a theory or combating a prejudice. The profits of the school now
                           enabled him to buy a few books, and also some philosophical instruments, which
                           he used<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="46" data-tei-n="40"> </a></span> merely to instruct and amuse his boys.
                           He tells us that he had no leisure to make any experiments till many years
                           later. A portrait of him at this period of his life shows a slender, intelligent
                           young minister in wig, gown, and bands. At Nantwich he learned to play the
                           flute, and makes the odd observation that he would “recommend the knowledge and
                           practice of music to all studious persons, and it will be better for them if,
                           like myself, they should have no very fine ear or exquisite taste, as by this
                           means they will be more easily pleased and be less apt to be offended when the
                           performances they hear are but indifferent.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e856">In 1761 he moved to Warrington, where he succeeded the famous Dr. Aikin as “tutor
                           in the learned languages” at the Academy. “But as I told the persons who brought
                           me the invitation, I should have preferred the office of teaching the
                           mathematics and natural philosophy, for which I had at that time a great
                           predilection.” Here he remained six years, and in the second year became a
                           married man, his wife being sister to one of his pupils, William Wilkinson, and
                           daughter of a wealthy Welsh ironmaster.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="47" data-tei-n="41"> </a></span> This is
                           how he writes about her many years later; there is no want of feeling in the
                           simplicity of the style: our great‐grandparents did not wear their hearts upon
                           their sleeves:—
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e861">“This proved a very suitable and happy connection, my wife being a woman of an
                           excellent understanding much improved by reading, of great fortitude and
                           strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and
                           generous, feeling strongly for others and little for herself. Also excelling in
                           everything relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all
                           concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of
                           my studies.”

                        <p id="d45862e864">It is a tradition in the family that Mrs. Priestley once sent her famous husband
                           to market with a large basket, and that he so acquitted himself that she never
                           sent him again! She was extremely intelligent and original, and her letters are
                           much brighter than the Doctor’s. Lord Shelburne found her one morning sitting on
                           the top of a pair of steps, clad in a great apron, and vigorously pasting on a
                           new well‐paper. She received him with calm composure! There<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="48" data-tei-n="42"> </a></span> is a good portrait of her as an elderly lady in a
                           cap, curving her hand round her ear to assist her hearing. She must have herself
                           insisted upon being painted in this unusual attitude. She certainly looks like a
                           person of excellent understanding whose mind had been much improved by
                           reading.

                        <p id="d45862e869">In 1767 Priestley received an invitation to take charge of the congregation of
                           Mill Hill Chapel at Leeds, and in September he moved thither, and remained six
                           years. In 1772 he made his first publication on the subject of air. It was a
                           small pamphlet on the method of impregnating water with fixed air. It was
                           immediately translated into French, and excited a great degree of attention to
                           the subject, and in the following year he published his first paper of
                           experiments “in a large article of the Philosophical Transactions,” and was
                           awarded the gold medal of the Royal Society. By the kindness of Mr. Charles
                           Aikin, I am enabled to give a letter written by Priestley to Miss Aikin
                           (afterwards Mrs. Barbauld), which refers to similar experiments. The letter has
                           no postmark, and is undated, but the reference to a second publication by Miss
                           Aikin, and the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="49" data-tei-n="43"> </a></span> allusion to Calne, fixes the
                           date as the latter end of 1773.

                           will be such as to enable him to make you a handsome recompense.

                           though it may not be an easy matter to supply his place so well with respect to
                           his ability, I hope you may be more happy upon the whole with another. I wish
                           you may get some person of reputation, because the Academy will otherwise
                           dwindle into a common school, and of that kind it will never be a first rate or

                           also make

                           impregnate the water to saturation. The former I get immediately from Sal
                           Ammoniac, and the latter from common salt. At present I do little besides
                           attending to my experiments, in which I have been of late peculiarly successful;
                           yesterday I made some remarkable experiments on the mixture of ether with

                        <p id="d45862e922">In that year Miss Aikin published two volumes, one of verse and one of prose (the
                           first of which went immediately through four editions); and in that year
                           Priestley went to Calne, in, Wiltshire, near Lord Shelburne’s seat of Bowood. He
                           seems to have taken a house in the village for Mrs. Priestley and the children,
                           but to have been constantly occupied in the great House, where he says that his
                           office was “nominally that of librarian,” but that he had “little employment as
                           such.” In the second year he made with Lord Shelburne a considerable tour,
                           visiting Flanders, Holland, and Germany, as far as Strasburg, returning by
                           Paris, where<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="52" data-tei-n="46"> </a></span> a most interesting month was spent
                           in the brilliant, intellectual society of the Encyclopedists. With
                           characteristic attention to the one thing he thought important, Priestley makes
                           the only observation recorded upon the state of France; remarking, “’As I was
                           sufficiently apprised of the fact, I did not wonder, as I otherwise should have
                           done, to find all the philosophical persons to whom I was introduced in Paris
                           unbelievers in Christianity, and even professed Atheists. As I chose on all
                           occasions to appear as a Christian, I was told by some of them that I was the
                           only person they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion,
                           who professed to believe Christianity. This was also the case with a great part
                           of the company I saw at Lord Shelburne’s.”

                        <p id="d45862e927">It is said that a manuscript exists in the Town Library of Aix, in Provence,
                           giving some particulars of Priestley in Paris, but I made a fruitless search for
                           it on the only occasion of remaining a day in that town.

                           metropolis at Lansdowne House. His noteworthy experiments in the beer vats of a
                           brewery at Leeds had made him known to the members of the Royal Society, he had
                           become intimately acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, and a proposition had even
                           been made that he should accompany Captain Cook in the voyage undertaken in
                           1772. He spent several years in Lord Shelburne’s house, and appears to have
                           moved from thence to Birmingham. But when he had been some years settled in that
                           town, Lord Shelburne “sent an especial messenger and common friend to engage me
                           again in his service,” but Dr. Priestley declined the offer.

                           after his departure from Warrington it is needless to enter. It is open to all
                           who care to read about it. His letters and those of his scientific friends are
                           touched by an imaginative light of intellectual dawn. Franklin and Wedgwood,
                           James Watt and the elder Darwin, felt a breeze as from a mountain‐top. Not for
                           them was Nature pessimistic in her conclusions. They did not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="54" data-tei-n="48"> </a></span> anticipate that a perfected telescope would only
                           serve to bring us within range of the ravening tyrants of the Star! They were
                           haunted by no visions of a dying sun and a cooling earth. Most of them saw God
                           in clouds and heard Him in the wind; and even those who were touched by
                           intellectual atheism conceived of Nature as a boundless realm of progressive

                        <p id="d45862e941">Priestley was made Doctor of Laws by the University of Edinburgh, and a member of
                           the Royal Society by the agency of Franklin. He tells us this in four lines, and
                           goes on to write six close pages on Scriptural matters as discussed by his
                           colleagues, the tutors and ministers of Warrington. During several years he and
                           his wife had to practise the most laborious economy in order to feed and educate
                           their four children. It would be curious to learn what were the necessaries and
                           what the luxuries of life in Yorkshire a hundred and twenty‐five years ago. What
                           did meat cost, and was it eaten every day? What was the price of textile
                           fabrics, and what was paid in wages? All who know the details of a minister’s
                           house even in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="55" data-tei-n="49"> </a></span> the first half of this century
                           can keenly realize how very hard it was to have everything sacked, torn, and
                           burnt in the Birmingham Riots.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e946">When these occurred Priestley had been settled eleven years in the town as
                           minister, and very happy years they had proved. His house, Fair Hill, was really
                           in the country, but was then within an easy walk of the central streets. Dotted
                           about were the wealthy abodes of prosperous merchants and manufacturers, and
                           here he found “good workmen” to make his instruments, and “the society of
                           persons eminent for their knowledge of chemistry.” Here he met the Lunar
                           Society, which dined together every month at the full of the moon, and numbered
                           James Watt, Matthew Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, and Mr. Galton among its members.
                           All this happy activity, this peaceful and refined centre of human life, was
                           swept away in four cruel days, and never reconstituted.

                        <p id="d45862e949">In the first fortnight of July, 1791, a number of Birmingham gentlemen had
                           planned to dine together at an hotel, to commemorate the destruction of the
                           Bastille two years previously. At that time the coming horrors of the
                           Revolution<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="56" data-tei-n="50"> </a></span> were undreamt of. The French
                           royal family were at the Tuileries, and not a single head had as yet fallen
                           beneath the guillotine. The mild men who wished to dine together in the full
                           light of a blazing afternoon in July had no wish for anything but the highest
                           good of their kind, and Dr. Priestley, meeting Mr. Berrington, the well‐known
                           Catholic priest, at tea on Wednesday the 6th, asked him and their host, Mr.
                           William Hutton, to join the banquet. But Mr. Berrington was more acute than the
                           Doctor, and replied, “No; we Catholics stand better with Government than you
                           Dissenters, and we will not make common cause with you.” On Monday the 11th the
                           dinner was advertised in a local newspaper, and—sinister portent—immediately
                           under that advertisement was “another, informing the public that the names of
                           the gentlemen who should dine at the hotel on Thursday would be published, price
                           one halfpenny. This seemed a signal for mischief, but mischief was unknown in
                           Birmingham, and no one regarded it.” So wrote Miss Catherine Hutton in a letter
                           dated the following week. She adds that her brother Thomas told her on Tuesday
                           the 12th<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="57" data-tei-n="51"> </a></span> that “a riot was expected on Thursday,
                           but so little was I interested by the intelligence that it left no impression on
                           my mind. The word ‘riot,’ since so dreadful, contained no other idea than that
                           of verbal abuse.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e956">The dinner took place. A mob assembled and broke the windows, hissing and
                           groaning, but the Liberal gentlemen did not apparently think much of this, and
                           several of them went and took tea at a friend’s house in town. This was
                           literally noted as occurring at five o’clock, and it happens that their
                           conversation has been recorded in a private letter, since privately printed. Dr.
                           Priestley, however, was not with them at dinner or at tea. He had been persuaded
                           by a wary friend to stay away. The lively, bright girl, Miss Mary R., who wrote
                           the most vivid of all the accounts which have come down to us, went that
                           afternoon to Fair Hill, and found Mrs. Priestley preparing to walk into
                           Birmingham. To the rumours of window‐breaking, told her by her young friend, she
                           replied with characteristic decision, “Nonsense, my dear,” or words to that
                           effect. The two set out together and walked back into the town, the distance of
                           a mile, where<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="58" data-tei-n="52"> </a></span> they found the gentlemen still at
                           tea. They were all friends, and mostly relatives by blood or marriage—the older
                           Birmingham families forming a sort of local mercantile aristocracy, full of
                           culture and public spirit. After the ladies had returned each to their homes,
                           Miss Mary R. went to look at a new conservatory which her father had just built
                           for his daughters. It was quite empty, but the gardener had prepared the mould,
                           and had purchased a number of plants which the young people meant to set early
                           the next morning.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e961">The flowers were never planted. The conservatory remains as “the baseless fabric
                           of a vision.” When the twilight darkened, the young ladies stood upon their
                           father’s lawn watching the double glow where the Old and New Meeting Houses were
                           in flames. Then Mr. Samuel Ryland, whose daughter was engaged to marry Joseph
                           Priestley the younger, got “a chaise” and hurried off to Fair Hill. He had been
                           warned by “a very Liberal Churchman, Mr. Vale,” who had heard mischief intended,
                           and begged him to “take Dr. Priestley away, as he was fearful his life was in
                           danger.” Mr. Ryland<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="59" data-tei-n="53"> </a></span> found the Doctor, who had
                           not been into Birmingham at all, “playing at backgammon with his wife, and when
                           informed his meeting house was on fire could scarcely believe it, and refused to
                           leave home.” Probably Mrs. Priestley also said she would not go, abandoning her
                           pleasant, orderly rooms, her hundred and one simple treasures, her china, her
                           linen, her books, the house where her children had grown up. However, “he and
                           Mrs. Priestley were persuaded to get into the carriage” and leave the house to
                           his servants and a few young men who had arrived meanwhile with the intelligence
                           of the riot. These young men, members of the congregation, had begged hard to be
                           allowed to defend Fair Hill. But Dr. Priestley absolutely forbade them to strike
                           a blow. He told them that a minister of the gospel must not risk bloodshed even
                           in lawful defence of his worldly goods, and he passed out of the house, leaving
                           behind him his library, his costly and beautiful philosophical instruments, his
                           treasured manuscripts, the notes of five and twenty years of scientific
                           labour.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e967">When the chaise with Dr. and Mrs. Priestley had relied away, the servants
                           extinguished every<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="60" data-tei-n="54"> </a></span> fire, the blinds were drawn
                           down, and in the darkened rooms began that vigil by Mr. Hill which his one
                           surviving son, Mr. Frederick Hill, has lately recounted in such moving terms.
                           For half an hour the young man watched and waited; then came the tramp of the
                           mob. The rest is matter of oft‐repeated history. The ringleaders procured a
                           light from the nearest public‐house and set fire to the laboratory and the
                           library. Of all the property in that dwelling an official inventory was
                           afterwards compiled, a copy of which was made for Mr. Timmins, the well‐known
                           local historian and antiquary, a hundred years later. The original document is a
                           folio book of sixty‐five pages, in which the most minute details are given, and
                           the value of each entry given by sworn valuers, surveyors for the building,
                           auctioneers for the furniture, and booksellers for the books. All these are very
                           curious and interesting as records of the interior of a substantial house one
                           hundred years ago, and valuable as a register of the prices of household
                           furniture. It has been partially reproduced in Dr. Carrington Bolton’s
                           interesting volume of Priestley’s scientific correspondence,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="61" data-tei-n="55"> </a></span> privately printed in New York. In addition to the
                           splendid apparatus given to the Doctor partly by Lord Shelburne, partly by
                           Wedgwood and other friends, are noted a large silver medallion of Sir Isaac
                           Newton, and another in Wedgwood ware, two “five‐guinea notes” in pocket books, a
                           Magellan timepiece, three black Wedgwood inkstands, a large mahogany lathe,
                           sixty pounds’ worth of lenses, and other optical instruments, including a large
                           camera obscura. Of “chemical substances” there were six or seven hundred, liquid
                           and solid, of which no account can be given, many of them the results of
                           expensive processes.

                        <p id="d45862e974">About three years later a similar inventory was taken of the apparatus of the
                           French chemist, Lavoisier, guillotined in May, 1794.

                           Of the actual burning a strange record exists. An artist of the name of Exted, a
                           “pupil of Hogarth,” made an elaborate painting in oils, sketched upon the spot.
                           “This picture represents the mob, with the banner inscribed ‘Church and King,’

                           stretched out at length. Several of the faces are portraits; among them the
                           town‐crier with his public bell, a demon who attended on the occasion to incite
                           the mob.” This description is from a private letter. It is my impression that
                           the secret history of the Birmingham Riots has never been unearthed, and now
                           never will be known. Political passion has subsided; Churchmen and Dissenters
                           have changed their lines of thought; the New Meeting House has become a Roman
                           Catholic chapel, and Dr. Priestley’s congregation meets in a fine building
                           called the Church of the Messiah, and a son of Sarah S. became the
                           much‐respected Mayor and most prominent citizen of the metropolis of the
                           Midlands.

                        <p id="d45862e991">Of the destruction of many other houses, far wealthier than that of Priestley’s,
                           sad stories remain, notably the ruin of William Hutton’s<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="63" data-tei-n="57"> </a></span> two dwellings; while Dr. Priestley’s journey to
                           London, his sojourn at Hackney, and final emigration to America are matters of
                           history. But, on examining the documents, some unpublished, others printed in
                           old‐fashioned magazines, from whence they have never emerged, I am deeply
                           impressed with the struggle it cost him to cross the Atlantic, and the changed
                           life to which he submitted. The younger men of the congregation, including his
                           own sons, believed in the possibility of a successful settlement across the
                           ocean. But, as happened in the case of Winthrop, a hundred and sixty years
                           earlier, the hand of death lay heavy on the exiles. The first to go was Henry
                           Priestley, a delicate young man brought up for a learned profession. He flung
                           himself into a farmer’s life, caught ague, then fever, from exposure in the
                           unwonted climate, and died in 1795. His valiant mother survived him just nine
                           months. The New House, now known as the Priestley House, and kept up by
                           Government, was partly planned by her, the notable housewife who for thirty‐four
                           years had spared her husband every practical care. She did not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="64" data-tei-n="58"> </a></span> live to inhabit it. Priestley’s habitual submission
                           carried him over a time of deep depression, which he pathetically tries in his
                           letters to conceal. Over them, though some of them have been printed from a
                           collection at Warrington, I draw a veil. Under the deep self‐control and reserve
                           of his Presbyterian nurture was hidden a soul sensitively alive to affection,
                           and an intellect instinct with genius. Among men he had one dear friend, with
                           whom he continued to correspond. The following letter, hitherto unpublished,
                           ends with sad, suppressed yearning. It reached its destination, travelling from
                           the backwoods of Pennsylvania to the Strand, and lies before me now:—

                           from Mr. Johnson, though by no means all that I wrote for long ago. In it I was
                           disappointed not to find either Mr. Belsham’s ‘Lectures,’ or his (brother’s)
                           fifth and sixth volumes. But my<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="65" data-tei-n="59"> </a></span> son, being at
                           Philadelphia when the box arrived, purchased those books for me. The history,
                           being more immediately interesting, I read first, and also the ‘Answer to Mr.
                           Marsh,’ and I admire them as much as, from your account of them, I expected to
                           do. I am, however, astonished at the freedom with which he writes. Nothing of
                           the kind would have passed unnoticed here during Mr. Adams’ administration. I
                           long to see another volume, which I imagine will bring the history down to the
                           general peace. I see references to his history in quarto. Is this materially
                           different from that in octavo?

                           clearness and comprehensiveness. That any work of this kind should be inviting
                           to the generality of readers cannot be expected, especially as there is nothing
                           of controversy to stimulate. It will, however, I doubt not, be long a standard

                           promised three in a week. Four volumes will complete the whole. As I have hardly

                           account of the state of religion in France and Germany, where Unitarianism has
                           already gained great ground, and has been the means of putting a stop to the
                           spread of infidelity. He was intimate with Mr. de la Harpe, the tutor of the
                           Emperor Alexander of Russia, and from his letters I have formed great
                           expectations from him. He is the friend of liberty, and in this promises to be a
                           truly patriot prince. Mr. Stone urges me much to go to Paris. But any removal is
                           now out of the question. I must be thinking of my last, and I am thankful that I
                           see no great cause to be anxious about it. I have lived in good health to the
                           usual term of human life, and hope I have done some good in it, though I am
                           sensible I might have done more. I am particularly thankful that you have been
                           so long preserved to me and to the world. What could I have done without you?
                           and this in many respects. I can only wish that we may derive the same advantage

                           happiness in the children of his eldest son. No murmur ever crossed his lips. He
                           worked on to the very last, correcting proofs of his “Notes on Isaiah” two days
                           before he died, “and, having examined the Greek and Hebrew quotations, and

                           should finish the work very well.” On the morning of his death, February 6,
                           1804, he dictated an alteration in a pamphlet; his son read it over to him, and
                           he said, “That is right, and I have now done.” He had previously offered
                           grateful thanks to the Almighty for giving him a painless death among his
                           children; and putting his hand before his face, so that those watching him could
                           not tell the exact moment, he passed away in deep and conscious communion with
                           his God.

                           <hi id="d45862e1062">YOU</hi> have asked me to recall to you Rome as I first saw it, in the spring
                           of 1857. It is as if one tried to revive the beauty of a dead cyclamen, for the
                           old poetic charm of Rome is withered away. In all ages that city, which was the
                           centre of the civilized world, must needs have been subject to change and to
                           large destruction. Rome has been sacked and burned, overthrown and rebuilt, its
                           pagan palaces have half sunk beneath the soil, in the lapse of centuries the
                           Field of Mars became covered with the modern quarter, and a strange tangle of
                           associations was silently and unconsciously created, the disentangling of which
                           was a delight to the poet and the antiquary; but the total effect remained that
                           of a very old picture, harmonized and browned by time. That picture has been
                           cleaned, revarnished, and the lover of Rome<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="71" data-tei-n="65"> </a></span>
                           must dwell in his old impressions if he hopes to revive the past.

                        <p id="d45862e1068">In the spring of 1857 no railway came within many hours of the Eternal City. She
                           sat in isolated majesty upon the wild Campagna, and the traveller entered her
                           gates as Cæsar and Cicero, Leo and Pius, and kings and pilgrims from time
                           immemorial have approached, by travelling along the Aurelian Way. In 1818 six
                           English youths sent to colonize the desolate and half ruined English College,
                           similarly crossed the Campagna, and one of them, a famous man in later years,
                           tells us of the “great cupola, cutting like a huge peak into the clear winter
                           sky, increasing in size with every mile.” For indeed the rolling Campagna is
                           like the sea, across which you may see the snowy sails of a ship, herself
                           invisible. And that period of forty years had in 1857 made but little change. To
                           us also the dome appeared faintly upon the horizon; beautiful was the wealth of
                           flowers in the southern spring, the wayside bright and delicate with asphodel,
                           and spaced with the mile‐stones of the famed Aurelian Way. The far mountains
                           were filmy in the distance, the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="72" data-tei-n="66"> </a></span> classic
                           mountains which are the best guardians of ancient traditions, for man cannot
                           change their outline; and in Rome itself Mrs. Anna Jameson was waiting to
                           receive one young traveller, and she was perhaps the most wonderful cicerone in
                           the world, dearest, wittiest, most cultured of women, and though sixty years
                           old, retaining all the fire and enthusiasm of her youth. It is impossible to
                           give to another generation any adequate idea of many men and women whose
                           personality was greater than their achievement, or whose achievements were
                           practically those of the improvisatore.

                        <p id="d45862e1073">Mrs. Jameson was born in the year 1794 in Dublin. Her father, Brownell Murphy,
                           married an English wife; he was a well‐known miniature painter, who came over to
                           England and became eventually Painter in Enamel to the young Princess Charlotte
                           of Wales in the year 1810. It is told of Mr. Murphy that he once took the
                           liberty of asking Her Majesty Queen Charlotte whether she recollected a famous
                           picture of Nell Gwynne, known to have once existed in the Windsor Gallery. The
                           Queen replied at once, that most assuredly since 
                           <emph id="d45862e1075">she</emph> had resided
                           at<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="73" data-tei-n="67"> </a></span> Windsor there had been no Nell Gwynne
                           there! At the sad death of Princess Charlotte, the hopes, fortunes, and
                           happiness of many to whom she had shown kindness failed, and the Murphys
                           suffered with the rest, but Anna Murphy was tenderly devoted to her parents, and
                           both before and after her own marriage she never ceased to be the most devoted
                           of daughters. Her life, with all its varying fortunes, has been well told by her
                           favourite niece, Gerardine, the wife of Robert Macpherson of Rome. It was
                           published by Longmans, and to it we must refer those who would fain know more of
                           one of the best and brightest women of the earlier years of the Victorian
                           era.

                        <p id="d45862e1081">Mrs. Jameson’s writing was like eloquent speech; she was an interpreter of art
                           and nature, she was a human Irish harp; to see her kindle into enthusiasm amidst
                           the gorgeous natural beauty and the antique memorials and the sacred Christian
                           relics of Italy was an experience not to be forgotten. There is not a cyprus
                           upon the Roman hills, or a sunny vine overhanging the southern gardens, or a
                           picture in those vast sombre galleries of foreign palaces, or a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="74" data-tei-n="68"> </a></span> catacomb spread out dark under the martyr churches of
                           the City of the Seven Hills, which is not associated with some vivid flash of
                           her intellect and imagination, and with a dearer recollection of personal
                           kindness from the old to the young.

                        <p id="d45862e1087">Of the actual entrance into Rome it is strange that I can remember nothing. It
                           must have been after dark on a moonless night, and the voyage from Genoa and the
                           long hours in the open air behind the postillion of other days must have made me
                           fall unromantically asleep. But in the gray dawn of the next morning I awoke,
                           and woke to Rome. It was but little after six when I found some servant afoot to
                           let me out of the front door into the shadowed black and white street, the Via
                           Condotti. I was determined not to ask my way; to speak to a fellow‐creature
                           would have destroyed the spell. I had been, for a girl educated in the Forties,
                           well‐grounded in the classics, and I was back with Romulus and Remus in a
                           fantastic dream. I knew that what I wanted lay to the west, and I threaded my
                           way swiftly along the Corse. With a greater traveller I could have<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="75" data-tei-n="69"> </a></span> said, “From this point”—the Column of Antoninus—“all
                           reckoning was lost; a long, narrow street and a labyrinth of tortuous ways,
                           through which a glimpse of a church or palace front might be caught,
                           occasionally askew; the Farnese Palace, as completely Michelangelesque in brick
                           as the Moses is in marble,” and so on to his goal. But I was not an English
                           youth running for the English College; pagan was then my heart, and pagan all my
                           historic desire. Rain began to fall; if the skies had fallen it would have been
                           unheeded. I reached the foot of a flight of immense steps, knew them at a glance
                           by old engravings, and also the great buildings atop—swerved to the right and
                           round the corner of the gigantic edifice, and there—below me—there they were—the
                           three great pillars with the broken cornice, rising out of rough, unkempt,
                           hillocky ground, a waste of stone and grass, for the most part unexcavated,
                           untortured; the unswept Forum where Cicero had spoken, where Paul had passed,
                           where Goethe had stood amazed; and rising sharp from the soil that slender
                           shaft, by Byron named <q style=" display: block; ">

                           my steps, but the lapse of thirty‐seven years has left that one unparalleled

                        <p id="d45862e1099">And now began a period of such vivid intellectual happiness as can fall to the
                           lot of few; in Rome with Mrs. Jameson. She was visiting her niece Gerardine,
                           whose house was a centre for the English in Rome, and a room had been arranged
                           for me in the dwelling of a friend; so that I came into the midst of all that
                           was going on. The Macphersons then lived in a villa just on the outskirts of the
                           city, with a heavenly view towards the mountains. My first visit was to St.
                           Peter’s, whither I was taken with a sort of solemnity, Mrs. Jameson herself
                           raising the great leathern screen and watching me as the vast nave met my view.
                           So that of the Catholic and mediæval world my first vision was through the eyes
                           of Michel Angelo. She then took me to see Gibson. The famous sculptor was a
                           little, gentle old man with whom it seemed to me that the Greek gods had
                           literally come down to live in the Via della Fontanella. In 1821 Mrs. Jameson
                           had seen him at work on a beautiful group of Psyche borne by the Zephyrs;<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="77" data-tei-n="71"> </a></span> in 1847 she had found him in the self‐same
                           studio, modelling the bas‐relief of the Hours leading forth the Horses of the
                           Sun, and had felt that “there was something inexpressibly touching, and
                           elevating too, in the sense of progress without change; all appeared the same in
                           that modest, quiet little room, but round it extended lofty and ample ateliers,
                           crowded with models of works, already executed or in progress, and with workmen,
                           assistants, students, visitors.” And here, after the lapse of another ten years,
                           she brought her young English friend. Gibson told Mrs. Jameson that his first
                           commission in Rome was from “a tall young man” who said he had been “sent by
                           Canova.” It was the Duke of Devonshire who made a happy man that day! “Mars and
                           Cupid” are now at Chatsworth.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1104">In 1844, when Gibson visited England, the Queen sent for him and commanded a
                           statue of herself, intimating at the same time a desire that the “statue should
                           be a faithful portrait such as her children should recognize, and calculated for
                           a room in the palace, not for any public institution.” The young Queen of five
                           and twenty sat every day for ten days. Gibson was wont to say<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="78" data-tei-n="72"> </a></span> that he owed his start in life more to the praises
                           bestowed on his work by Mrs. Jameson in the pages of her “Diary of an Ennuyée”
                           than to the fact of the group of Psyche borne aloft by the Zephyrs having been
                           purchased by Sir George Beaumont. The Diary, her first work, was published after
                           her marriage in 1825, and her only remuneration was a guitar!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1109">From Gibson’s studio the entranced visitor naturally turned to that of his
                           favourite pupil, Miss Hosmer, who had come from Boston five years previously. Of
                           all her admirable work, “Puck” was, perhaps, the most appreciated by her public
                           and by me. The Little Man struck a Shakespearian note amidst the endless classic
                           beauties of Rome. Gibson had evidently in some previous existence been intimate
                           with Phidias, but Miss Hosmer was of a newer time, and at that youthful period
                           she herself resembled a charming boy with a curly crop, except that few boys
                           ever show such dogged determination to succeed. She went on from strength to
                           strength, and was then working at a reclining figure of the Cenci. Many happy
                           hours I spent in Miss Hosmer’s studio, and for the first time<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="79" data-tei-n="73"> </a></span> understood the sculptor’s art and how the human image
                           gradually formed itself in the wet clay and died in plaster, to resuscitate in
                           marble.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1114">To a dark, endless catacomb, I think it was Santa Agnese, Mrs. Jameson took me in
                           the company of Sir David Brewster; and his keen intellect played vividly on the
                           most diverse associations. He was quite an old man, but had lately entered into
                           his second marriage with extraordinary freshness of feeling. He had a private
                           hobby, a fine collection of engraved gems, and brought them out one evening for
                           inspection. In that cosmopolitan Rome the strangest side‐lights fell upon
                           well‐known figures.

                        <p id="d45862e1117">Another image which rises to memory is that of Dr. Auguste Braun, the most
                           learned of German archæologists. He lived in a house on the top of the Tarpeian
                           Rock, from the windows of which was seen a splendid view over the Forum, and
                           there he carried on a great controversy about the site of the Temple of Jupiter
                           Capitolinus, a question upon which Germans and Italians were bitterly opposed.
                           One party<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="80" data-tei-n="74"> </a></span> said the foundations existed under
                           the church of Ara Cœli, the other party assigned them to the opposite hill; but
                           as the two hills were extremely near together and densely covered with buildings
                           of all ages, it was indeed a very pretty quarrel, and one in which I took at the
                           time a youthful and quite fantastic interest. Little did the disputants foresee
                           that within thirteen years a new Italy would arise, and Rome be given up to a
                           generation of railway‐makers and building speculators. Who now cares for that
                           poor old vanished temple? It is as extinct as the dispossessed Lion on the roof
                           of Northumberland House, whose tail pointed to so many quarters of the compass
                           that nobody could ever say which was which. Dr. Braun the archæologist died in
                           1860, and one is inclined to say that it was fortunate for him.

                        <p id="d45862e1123">The excavations of the soil of Rome at that epoch had been very partial, and a
                           sense of the mystery of the haunted ground enhanced its charm. They have since
                           been “Systematized,” and suggest an Examination in Ancient History. For
                           instance, in the Fifties the Coliseum was decorated with a rich flora.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="81" data-tei-n="75"> </a></span> Delicate ferns and mosses and creeping greenery
                           flourished among the huge steps and corridors, and were said to be unique,
                           springing from the blood of the martyrs. Total ignorance of botany prevents my
                           putting forth this as other than a legendary statement; but nature had
                           wonderfully softened the horrors of the pagan amphitheatre; the floor was a soft
                           mat of grass, and in the centre stood a black mission cross, where some monk had
                           preached of grace and redemption. The cross is gone, and half of the vast area
                           is deeply dug, and reveals the subterranean passages which ministered to the
                           cruel show. He who now walks in the Coliseum by

                           fatally attracted to the left of the great building, and to that hill‐road, once
                           so picturesque, but now blocked by a huge depôt for the sale of olive‐oil, the

                           description can be given! Peabody’s Lodgings and Queen Anne’s Mansions,
                           half‐finished and already old, dirty, and dilapidated—such is the vision that
                           meets the eye inside and outside the San Lorenzo gate. The financial troubles of
                           Italy have stopped the works, and it is a moot question whether what they meant
                           to do or what they half achieved is the more deplorable. One complete handsome

                           be praised as a beautiful street, but in the very nature of things Rome cannot
                           be effectually Haussmannized. The mementoes of the pagan past are too numerous
                           and too important to be disregarded, and the great churches and colleges
                           belonging to every nation<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="83" data-tei-n="77"> </a></span> in the civilized

                           old tourist as to their identity. In Rome we all have a vested interest; to the
                           English College, the Scotch College, and the Irish College is now added a
                           beautiful new Canadian College with the Imperial right of sanctuary. The French
                           have St. Louis des Français, and French Sisters of more than one Order have
                           standing room in Rome. That far‐famed English College, “where many a pilgrim,
                           gentle or simple, has knelt leaning on his trusty staff, cut in Needwood or the
                           New Forest,” and where among many other memorials of our dear land are the tombs
                           of Sir Thomes Dereham, of a Prior of Worcester and an Archbishop of York, is
                           standing evidence that the city of Rome guards other associations than those of
                           her own citizens. And putting aside those ecclesiastical treasures about which
                           men so widely differ, but of which it may be fairly said that all men of the
                           slightest culture regard them with interest, none can deny that the art
                           treasures of the Eternal City are the heritage of the world.

                           which may interest the younger world, and of which death and time have made it
                           possible to speak. Among these are certain written relics of Mary Howitt, whom I
                           well knew in the middle of her long career, and whose saintly death in Rome five
                           years ago, vividly recalled her sweet and gracious personality in the hearts of
                           her innumerable English friends, and especially of the surviving contemporaries
                           of her own children. Since then two thick volumes of memoirs have been published
                           by her daughter, and the changes of opinion undergone by Mary Howitt, and in a
                           lesser degree by her husband, are matter of public record. Together they lie in
                           the leafy Protestant cemetery of Rome; not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="85" data-tei-n="79"> </a></span> far
                           from the heart of Shelley (Cor Cordium), and from where reposes one who bears
                           the sole epitaph of “Filius Goethe.” Although she had lived during her last
                           years as a devout Catholic, and passed as we believe “in Paradiso,” her tender
                           love clung faithfully to the husband of her youth, and special permission was
                           given that she should be reunited to him in death. On the white marble of the
                           beautiful tomb the English stranger in Rome reads the familiar words “William
                           and Mary Howitt.”

                        <p id="d45862e1162">When I first saw the home of the Howitts they had left that old house at Clapton
                           to which such tender reference is made in the autobiography. Claude Howitt had
                           been dead about four years, and the pathetic page of Mary Howitt’s writing, in
                           which she tells her sister of the death of her boy, lay buried in a private
                           letter. It can be illustrated by a reference to her daily habit of unflagging
                           work. For many years the Howitts had so arranged their life as to be wholly
                           dependent on their own literary labour. The opportunities of modern authorship
                           were then undeveloped, but William Howitt’s talent and steady industry, and his
                           wife’s genius and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="86" data-tei-n="80"> </a></span> equally steadfast labour, met
                           every claim. It was at all times beautiful to see the delicate method, the
                           perfection with which Mrs. Howitt managed her household, her dress, her
                           persistent work with the pen. It was the result of the old Quaker training,
                           though she no longer wore the costume of a “Woman Friend,” and expressed a rare
                           high quality of character.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1167">I once had a youthful discussion with her as to how much writing could be done in
                           a day. She smiled, and fixed the limit, saying, “My dear, it is—such a number
                           of—pages of manuscript; it is practically impossible to overpass my average.”
                           And this explains the letter written after Claude’s death, which occurred in
                           March, 1844, and was the result of a sad accident at school caused by the
                           practical joke of a foolish boy. A month elapsed before his mother wrote to her
                           sister the letter which will be found on page fifteen of the second volume of
                           the memoirs. She begins, “Thy letter, my dearest sister (they always used
                           together the Quaker phraseology), was indeed like the voice of the truest and
                           sweetest affection. I have turned to it again and again, and I feel that,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="87" data-tei-n="81"> </a></span> among the many blessings which I enjoy—and I
                           enjoy a great many—is that of having a sister like thee.” She then speaks at
                           great length and with a wonderful chastened peace about Claude, a letter full of
                           resigned prayer; and ends thus:—

                        <p id="d45862e1172">“To‐morrow I intend again to commence my regular avocation. Poor dear Claude! At
                           this very moment I see the unfinished translation lying before me which was
                           broken off by his death. Alas! I could have shed burning tears over this. How
                           often did he beg and pray of me to put aside my translation just for that one
                           day, that I might sit by him and talk or read to him? I, never thinking how near
                           his end was—(the boy had been a tenderly nursed invalid for a year, and while,
                           on the one hand, the numerous doctors seemed to have hoped against hope, the
                           mother’s labour 
                           <emph id="d45862e1174">could</emph> not stop)—said, ‘Oh, no! I must go on yet a
                           page or two.’ How little did I think that in a short time I should have leisure
                           enough and to spare! Oh, Anna! of all the agonizing feelings which I know, none
                           is so bitter as that longing for the dead. Just one day, one hour of their
                           lives, that one might pour out the whole<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="88" data-tei-n="82"> </a></span> soul
                           of one’s inextinguishable love before them, and let them feel how dear,
                           inexpressibly dear, they are. My very heart at times dies within me from this
                           deep, agonizing longing. But, dearest, when we have angels in heaven, does not
                           death seem robbed of its terrors?
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1181">“I wonder how it is with families in heaven? for there must be different degrees
                           of worthiness in the different members. Some must have lower places than others.
                           I would be content to sit on the lowest footstool might I only be permitted to
                           behold the glory and the bliss of my beloved ones, and to make compensation to
                           them in some way for my shortcomings on earth.”

                        <p id="d45862e1184">It is well worth while to extract this wonderfully touching and humble letter
                           from the mass of printed matter in which it lies embedded. It is a revelation of
                           the writer’s spiritual life.

                        <p id="d45862e1187">In the next year, 1845, the Howitts went to Hastings, and formed a close intimacy
                           with a family with which my parents and I were also shortly to be tenderly and
                           gratefully associated: that of Mr. Benjamin Smith, the member for Norwich. A
                           great domestic affliction caused<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="89" data-tei-n="83"> </a></span> us to take up
                           our residence in Hastings—where, indeed, we were Mr. Smith’s tenants—and until
                           July, 1850, we were almost as one family, sheltered under the magnificent rock
                           of the Castle Hill. Hastings was not then what it is now; the old town was
                           widely separated from St. Leonards, and the lanes leading up to Ore Church were
                           lanes of deep country seclusion. It was here, in 1846‐7, that I first heard of
                           the Howitts as a family. Mrs. Howitt’s tales and poems had, of course, been
                           familiar to me from early childhood, more especially the exquisite “Sketches
                           from Natural History,” containing that ballad beginning “Will you walk into my
                           parlour, said the Spider to the Fly,” which has become so much a classic phrase
                           that I have seen it quoted in prose in a political leader, without any reference
                           to the authoress, or to the fact that the quotation formed part of a verse.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1192">If on the one hand we were all full of the distinguished authoress, and her
                           charming eldest daughter Anna Mary, on the other hand here is Mrs. Howitt’s
                           allusion to the Leigh Smiths, which will explain a reference in one of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="90" data-tei-n="84"> </a></span> her future letters to me. She describes the group of
                           five, of whom the eldest was then eighteen, and the youngest twelve; speaks of
                           their carriages and horses, and outdoor life, and of how “Every year their
                           father takes them a journey. He has a large carriage built like an omnibus, in
                           which they and their servants can travel and in it, with four horses, they make
                           long journeys. This year they were in Ireland,<a href="#belloc-walled02" class="ref-note">¹</a> and next year I expect they will go into Italy. Their father dotes
                           on them. They take with them books and sketching materials; and they have every
                           advantage which can be obtained them, whether at home or abroad. Such were and
                           are our friends the Leigh Smiths, and thou canst imagine how much pleasure we
                           were likely to derive from such a family.”

                        <p id="d45862e1200">The Howitts presently left Clapton, and settled near the Regent’s Park, and here
                           it was that I first saw them, being taken to the house by Miss Leigh Smith—the
                           Barbara of the letters. A vivid memory remains to me of an

                           of the room, her two younger children at her knee. She was then about fifty, and
                           in the very zenith of her life and literary fame. Tennyson and Mrs. Gaskell,
                           Talfourd and Joanna Baillie, Hans Christian Andersen and the Pre‐Raphaelite
                           Brethren, such are the first half‐dozen names which suggest themselves to me in
                           connection with the circle of the Howitts’ lives in that early time.

                        <p id="d45862e1207">In May, 1851, came a never‐to‐be‐forgotten day at Cambridge, when “Mr. Smith, of
                           Jesus” (Leigh Smith, the Arctic Explorer), welcomed his father, his sisters, and
                           their friends, including the two Pulskys, Professor Kinkel, and a good number of
                           bearded and moustachioed Hungarian exiles to the old University. Beards and
                           moustaches were quite uncommon in 1851. We all started at seven in the morning
                           from the Shoreditch station, and got back at eight in the evening, after a
                           splendid banquet offered by the father of Mr. Smith, of Jesus; and after forty
                           years that brilliant day is fresh in the memory of one grateful survivor. Mrs.
                           Howitt tells the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="92" data-tei-n="86"> </a></span> story at length in her bright

                        <p id="d45862e1213">The next home of the Howitt family was at the Hermitage, on the West Hill at
                           Highgate; the premises consisted of a small three‐storeyed house and a lesser
                           tenement—the Hermitage proper. In this extraordinary appendage, with an upper
                           chamber reached by an outside staircase, the whole thatched and buried in an
                           exuberant growth of ancient ivy, poets and painters had their natural home. I
                           find in an old book some verses which describe the strange room wherein once
                           Dante Gabriel Rossetti had painted, and where Anna Mary Howitt now covered her
                           canvas with some of the most delicate, beautiful drawings ever done by a woman’s
                           hand.

                        <p id="d45862e1216">She became a pupil of Kaulbach, and recorded her experiences in a book which was
                           warmly welcomed and has been lately reprinted. It was entitled “The Art Student
                           in Munich.” Her companion during that student year was Jane Benham Hay, whose
                           pictures were admitted to the line on the wall of the Royal Academy. The career
                           of this admirable artist suffered eclipse, or she would now be recognized as
                           a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="93" data-tei-n="87"> </a></span> worthy predecessor of Lady Butler. She
                           had a devoted and honourable friend in the late Mr. Edward Pigott. Her life
                           passed in Italy, and I do not know if she be yet living to read this short
                           record of her early triumphs.

                           engraving of the Hermitage, with William and Mary Howitt in the foreground. I
                           think, however, that it is of the house and not of the appendage, though the one
                           is apparently as heavy with ivy as the other.

                        <p id="d45862e1232">The first letter which I find I have preserved of Mary Howitt’s is dated from
                           this residence, on the West Hill, where they remained many years. It is of
                           December, 1858, and is addressed to my mother, at a moment when I was lying in
                           imminent danger of death. It is too personal for quotation, and I pass on to
                           Good Friday of the year 1865, when Mrs. Howitt writes from West Hill Lodge about
                           a Sussex Guide of mine which she had in her possession. She is about to go to

                           the budding leaves and all the amenity of this lovely springtime recall Scalands
                           and those pleasant woods to my mind.” She refers to a time which really gave me
                           my last living memory of dear Mary Howitt, though our intimacy may truly be said
                           to have lasted unbroken to the weeks immediately preceding her death, five and
                           twenty years afterwards. I shall ever remain grateful for those spring weeks of
                           1864, when William and Mary Howitt were living at Scalands Cottage, the English
                           home of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="95" data-tei-n="89"> </a></span> Miss Leigh Smith, who had become Madame
                           Bodichon. It was in the April of that year, and very shortly after the death in
                           New Zealand of poor Charlton Howitt, whom I had known so well as a young boy,
                           and of my own familiar friend Adelaide Procter, who had died on Candlemas Day,
                           that I met Mrs. Howitt on the platform of the Robertsbridge station. I was going
                           to a kind friend at an old farmhouse known as Brown’s, and the Howitts were at
                           Scalands, of which she writes:—“Barbara has built her cottage upon the plan of
                           the old Sussex houses, in a style which must have prevailed at the time of the
                           Conquest. It is very quaint, and very comfortable at the same time.” And she
                           gives lovely pictures in her letters of those “purple woods of Sussex,” then
                           blue with the wild hyacinth, in all the inexpressible tender beauty of the
                           spring. It was there that I was privileged to enjoy my last conversations with
                           Mary Howitt. I was on the very eve of submitting to the Catholic Church, though
                           I feel sure that I said nothing of it to her; and she at that time was deeply
                           impressed with Spiritualism, and her whole nature

                           drowned in a New Zealand lake. His knotted blanket, with its home letters and
                           the scant baggage of a young surveying engineer, had been washed ashore; but of
                           the manner and moment of his perishing there was no earthly record, nor was his
                           body ever washed ashore. I well remember Mrs. Howitt’s unwonted pallor as she
                           spoke of him to me, and that for the first and only time I felt her strong
                           nature to be shaken from its perfect equilibrium. She believed she had
                           communications from Charlton, and said so to me with the utmost plainness, and
                           many were the conversations we had together.

                        <p id="d45862e1252">It was in the spring of 1856 that, as she herself tells, she and her husband
                           first paid attention to the phenomena of spiritualism. At a 
                           <foreign id="d45862e1254" xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> at Professor de Morgan’s she “was much
                           astonished and affected by communications purporting to come from my dear son
                           Claude.” Just as at the later epoch she asserted that she had been told of the
                           manner in which Charlton went down, unwitnessed, in the waters of the New
                           Zealand lake. For certainly more<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="97" data-tei-n="91"> </a></span> than ten years
                           the mind of both the husband and the wife were extraordinarily impressed by the
                           extraordinary meetings which took place in every part of London. Those were days
                           when Mr. Hume was credibly asserted (I believe, by the Master of Lindsay) to
                           have floated out of one window and through another of a flat in Victoria Street
                           upon the sixth floor; when, as Mrs. S.C. Hall described to me, a band of musical
                           instruments flew madly about her room, to the imminent danger of her mirrors;
                           and Mr. Hall told me that he had seen Hume stretched to the abnormal length of
                           seven feet upon the floor, and afterwards contract to his natural size. It was
                           impossible then, it is equally impossible now, to decide what part in these
                           things was played by imposture and what by occult agencies, with which Catholics
                           are forbidden to tamper, but do not deny. In her later years Mrs. Howitt shrank
                           from the subject, and her daughter has touched upon it lightly. She herself,
                           however, alludes to it in the first of the two letters which I shall now give.
                           The first sentence I believe to refer to the granting of a pension on the Civil
                           List to William Howitt. After<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="98" data-tei-n="92"> </a></span> his death, in
                           1879, Lord Beaconsfield granted a similar pension to Mary Howitt.

                           remember that I never saw her again. My marriage caused me to live much in
                           France, and on their side the Howitts left England, and went to live in Italy
                           and in Tyrol. Letters must have passed, and messages through our many mutual
                           friends. I never assuredly forgot the happy intercourse of former years, nor
                           they a kindly interest in the vicissitudes of my lot. But the war of 1870 swept
                           away all my correspondence of the immediately preceding years, and I was<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="100" data-tei-n="94"> </a></span> shortly absorbed in responsibilities which
                           left me scant leisure for anything beyond the duties of every hour. At last when

                           am willing to believe that you, as I know to be the case with myself, are very

                           and that we should seek for tidings about you and your children; in short, that

                           give us in return what we ask from you in love, news of yourself and your
                           children. Tell us all about them like a fond mother—what are their ages, what
                           are their names, and what is the direction of their minds—which is the poet and
                           which is the philosopher, for I believe there are two of them—and what are their
                           tastes and especial talents. In short, let it be a loving mother’s letter to an
                           aunt and grandmother, to whom they are strangers, but who loved their mother of
                           old. Nor is that the only subject on which you would find us sympathetic. You
                           are a Catholic, one of the great flock of Christ, and your heart and your
                           intellect have found nourishment and life in the loving and in the sublime

                           in the most exalted dreams of your young poetical imagination has been given to
                           you there. I do not think it was any surprise to us to learn that you had joined
                           that great fellowship of saints and martyrs, for you and Adelaide Procter were

                           from deep thought and constant, earnest prayer during our life in Rome, that
                           nowhere was it to be found except in the Church of St. Peter. But it was not in

                           study had led her to—for in spirit she had been a Catholic almost from her

                        <p id="d45862e1351">Such was the long and lovely letter in which she told me of her reception into
                           the Fold. I trust I may be forgiven for having given it in its entirety, in
                           spite of its references to myself and my forgotten verses. One other long letter
                           I received from the same dear and venerated hand; it was written about three
                           months before her death, and being dated from Meran, spoke of her approaching
                           journey to Rome for the Jubilee, where she greatly wished me to join her. I was
                           unable to go at Christmas, but fully purposed to do so at Easter, and thus see
                           her once more; for nothing in the letter indicated feebleness, or warned me of
                           an approaching end,

                        <p id="d45862e1354">But it was not to be. On January the 10th, 1888, Mary Howitt, the first of the
                           English pilgrims, was led up to Leo the Thirteenth on the occasion of his
                           Jubilee. Mr. Clifford presented her, and the Duke of Norfolk brought her
                           away.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="105" data-tei-n="99"> </a></span> The Pope laid his right hand upon her
                           aged head, and blessed her, telling her he would meet her again “in Paradiso.”
                           On the 30th of January she passed away in her sleep. When I came to Rome in
                           October, 1889, that Holy City of the most sacred memories of my life contained
                           also the grave of Mary Howitt.

                           <hi id="d45862e1369">THAT</hi> the life of an eminent Englishwoman should have been written by a
                           Frenchwoman, is in itself a point of interest; but especially so when the
                           Englishwoman was Lady Georgiana Fullerton, sister to Lord Granville, and her
                           biographer Madame Augustus Craven, whose maiden name was Pauline de la
                           Ferronnays, and whose first work, “Le Récit d’une Sœur,” passed though forty
                           editions.

                        <p id="d45862e1373">Lady Georgiana died ten years ago, and in the wide circle which she frequented, a
                           society chiefly knit together by incessant charitable work, the loss of her
                           familiar figure caused a great blank. She was tall and largely built, her face
                           was plain, but full of bright intelligence and gentle humour, naturally a merry
                           face; she always dressed in black, wearing a shawl across her shoulders, and no
                           gloves. She said that gloves cost too much money, and that she had much<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="107" data-tei-n="101"> </a></span> rather give the half‐crown to the poor.
                           Having had many occasions of speaking with her, I would describe the impression
                           she made on her contemporaries as so marked that in entering even a crowded room
                           Lady Georgiana would have been one of the first people to be noticed, from her
                           majestic figure and the plain severity of her dress.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1378">She was very nobly born. Her father, Lord Granville, served his country for a
                           long series of years as Ambassador to France. Her mother, an excellent,
                           conscientious woman, was daughter to that beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of
                           whom so many anecdotes survive, and whose life‐size portrait by Gainsborough
                           disappeared so mysteriously some years ago. Sir Joshua Reynolds also repeatedly
                           painted the Duchess, the best known portrait being the one wherein she is
                           playing with her child. It was after this lovely grandmother that the little
                           girl was named Georgiana. She had an elder sister, Susan, and the two were
                           carefully and even severely educated by a good governess, against whose
                           influence Georgiana at one time rebelled, but who became, when she grew up, her
                           dear and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="108" data-tei-n="102"> </a></span> intimate friend. They lived in the
                           splendid house allotted to the British Embassy in Paris, entered by a vast court
                           from the Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré, and sheltered at the back by a large shady
                           garden. Most tourists know the great gates in the high wall surmounted by the
                           arms of England—the Lion and the Unicorn, no longer “fighting for the crown,”
                           and speaking of home to all British residents in the capital of France. Two
                           little girls and three little boys then formed the English family at the
                           Embassy.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1383">When the Ladies Susan and Georgiana Leveson Gower grew up, they were taken by
                           their mother, Lady Granville, into the great world of fashion which then
                           surrounded the French court, and to the famous Almack’s, in London, and they
                           both married early. Lady Susan became the wife of Earl Rivers, and Lady
                           Georgiana, after some little opposition, was allowed to marry the man she
                           preferred, an untitled gentleman, Captain Fullerton. Her father was afraid that
                           there was not enough money to enable his daughter to live as she had been
                           brought up, and, on the other hand, the parents of the bridegroom were alarmed
                           at his<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="109" data-tei-n="103"> </a></span> marrying a young lady whose father,
                           mother, uncles, aunts and cousins, all belonged to the greatest nobility of
                           England. The obstacles, were, however, smoothed away by the active kindness of
                           the Duke of Devonshire, who was tenderly attached to his niece. Very pretty and
                           charming are her letters to him; she was, indeed, an “old‐fashioned girl,” and
                           sent quaint, modest messages through him to the man of her heart. Finally,
                           Captain Fullerton left the army on half pay, a post was found for him at the
                           Embassy in Paris, and the young couple after their marriage lived with Lord and
                           Lady Granville in the great old house where Lady Georgiana had passed her
                           childhood and youth. She was one‐and‐twenty when her son was born—her only son,
                           her only child.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1389">The next ten years of Lady Georgiana’s life passed in the usual employment of her
                           rank and state in life. She notices, in her letters to her old governess and to
                           her sister Susan, all the little growths and changes in her boy’s childhood; how
                           he learnt to read, and how she has dressed him up for a child’s costume‐ball at
                           the French court. She writes at great length about<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="110" data-tei-n="104"> </a></span> his religious education and his Sunday toys; and then
                           there came a sad time when the little man was very ill, his brain too excitable,
                           said the doctors, and a threat was made of stopping his education. But he
                           recovered, and the grievous alarms of the parents were laid to rest.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1394">The letters presently reach the beginning of Lady Georgiana’s career as an
                           authoress, but she has left no record in her correspondence of the mental
                           travail she must have undergone before writing “Ellen Middleton,” a book in
                           which she tried to grapple with the deepest questions of conscience. She sent
                           the manuscript to Mr. Henry Greville and to Lord Brougham, the latter being then
                           at the zenith of his fame; and we have their letters and comments. Lord Brougham
                           greatly admires the novel, but objects to its High Church tendencies, for Lady
                           Georgiana had become a strong High Churchwoman. Henry Greville praises and
                           criticizes, and both men give it a singularly respectful attention. It was
                           published, and straightway greeted with a burst of applause, and “Grantley
                           Manor,” her second book, very soon revived the same chorus of delighted
                           admiration. The most unlikely people<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="111" data-tei-n="105"> </a></span> —Harriet
                           Martineau and the aged Maria Edgeworth—wrote of them as if they were ardent
                           young novel readers. Miss Martineau says she made her eyes red with crying! Mr.
                           Gladstone, then the youthful hope of the High Church and Tory Party, wrote an
                           elaborate review; the best minds in England on all sides agreed in reading and
                           delighting in these two books, full of theology and ardent old‐fashioned
                           romance.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1399">But ere the echoes had died away, Lady Georgiana Fullerton had followed her
                           husband and her revered friend, John Henry Newman, into the Roman Catholic
                           Church. It is pleasant to learn that this momentous step in no way broke up her
                           tender filial ties, nor her relations with her beloved sister and her nieces.
                           Lady Georgiana remained the bright, charming wife and mother; and young
                           Granville Fullerton went creditably through the years of education, and finally
                           entered the army. His health had occasionally aroused anxiety, but had not
                           debarred his preparation for the military career.

                        <p id="d45862e1402">When the first alarm of the Crimean War was sounded, it became necessary for the

                           arms in Europe, and now the best blood of England, in all ranks, was summoned to
                           that awful contest so disastrous in its earlier stages to the British troops,
                           and the Fullertons had to resign themselves to part with their son. Strange,
                           pathetic anxiety, 
                           <emph id="d45862e1406">not</emph> destined to be borne with lingering pain—fear
                           unrealized, anguish of waiting strangely changed into quite another doom. His
                           mother was prepared to send him forth to his professional duty, in what she
                           recognized as England’s cause. She would have watched for bulletins in alternate
                           agonies of fear and hope; had her boy been wounded, she would have hurried off
                           to Scutari; had he even been shot down in the trenches, he would have shared,
                           with ah! so many others, the honours of soldier’s grave; and she would have been
                           one of the many, many mothers who rued the name Sebastopol. But none of these
                           things were to be. At the last moment medical advice forbade the young fellow to
                           join the active army. Bitterly disappointed, he resigned himself to remain at
                           home, and going to visit his uncle, Lord Rivers, at Rushmore, in

                           we have been quoting, so neither will we detail it here. He was alone when the
                           summons came.

                        <p id="d45862e1412">We have been told by a private friend that when Mr. Fullerton received the letter
                           containing this terrible news, he did not at first know how to tell such a thing
                           to the wife of his youth, the beloved companion of his middle age, and that he
                           tenderly lured her into the open church where she was wont to pray, and there,
                           as she knelt peacefully before the altar, he found words in which to make her
                           understand that her one child was dead.

                        <p id="d45862e1415">Of this time of anguish Lady Georgiana Fullerton in after years never spoke or
                           wrote. Only in one note to a favourite niece, who had been as a sister to the
                           lost son, is there any mention of him; a note written just a year after his
                           death. With all the force of a powerful nature she submitted; and to us, who
                           knew her in later years, there seemed no darkness in her kindly smile, no moment
                           of flagging in her tireless charity.

                           beloved mistress of a household, she never broke. She engaged never to buy or
                           possess anything which was not absolutely necessary in the way of her ordinary
                           duties. Gloves went first; “the half crown for the poor” meant, by the end of
                           the year, the annual payment needed for some orphan child. How often were seen
                           the kind, useful hands laid for the moment on that comfortable black shawl, when
                           she stood amidst a group of other ladies at some meeting for the poor. In her
                           younger days she must inevitably have been accustomed to the finest dresses ever
                           made or worn, living, as she did, in the house of an ambassador of the first
                           rank. She now never wore any costume but the black dress and shawl and plain
                           cap, which might have suggested austerity but for the bright, merry eyes, which
                           were also penetrating and spiritual, full of mingled expressions. Who that has
                           read the “Récit d’une Sœur” but remembers the

                           touch of gaiety in Lady Georgiana’s eyes, infinitely touching to those who knew
                           the agony she had passed through.

                        <p id="d45862e1435">She did not lay down her pen, though she seems to have hesitated as to whether it
                           was right to give hours a day to the writing of romances. She drew up a curious
                           written argument in two columns, in which she says that she could earn so much
                           more money for the poor in this way than in any other, that she thought she
                           ought to continue; and most lovely were some of the stories she produced.
                           “Constance Sherwood,” an historical romance of the time of Elizabeth, is perhaps
                           the best. “Too Strange not to be True” is a striking story, based on the legend
                           of the survival of the Czarowitch, son of Peter the Great. Another is “A Will
                           and a Way,” the subtle story of a young woman constrained in the French
                           Revolution to marry a rough suitor who saves her father’s life. She redeems the
                           situation, changing her husband’s half savage nature and moulding him afresh.

                        <p id="d45862e1440">Of her manifold charities one knows not how to speak. She was the kindest and the
                           most industrious of women. The charge of orphans, sick people, and schools was a
                           daily matter of course to her, as to many another; but in touching ever so
                           slightly upon her sphere of activity, one became aware of the odds and ends
                           which were, so to speak, stuffed into the crevices from year’s end to year’s
                           end. The village library, of which, when she was called away to another part of
                           England, the covers were dropping off (happy books we loved so much, for ever
                           finding new treasures); the old servants pensioned; the five shillings slipped
                           into a little friend’s hand to buy a fan at a bazaar; the given book; the old
                           priest’s sister still living on the remains of her bounty; the bringing of the
                           Grey Sisters over from France (this last a serious heavy responsibility), and
                           establishing them in Westminster;—such are a few of the things which might be
                           multiplied indefinitely by the memories of others.

                        <p id="d45862e1445">And so, year by year, Lady Georgiana Fullerton’s life went on, until the time
                           came when she was attacked by a painful disease, and the black gown hung in long
                           thin folds on a wasted figure, which recalled some early Italian picture in the
                           severe grace of old age. On her deathbed she asked that the curtain covering her
                           son’s portrait should be withdrawn, saying that she had the courage to look at
                           it now. Another time, when Father Gallwey was reading the Scriptures to her, he
                           saw her eyes fill at an allusion to the death of a child; an involuntary
                           revelation of the pain silently endured for thirty years. Please God they are
                           now together, the mother and the son; and of her it may most emphatically be
                           said: “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord!”

                           strenuous life were swept away as if they had never been. The cradle of his
                           race, and the very core of his ancient dukedom, the town of Chambèry, is a

                           and sold at Hautecombe, in the hope that someone will send for the book, which
                           only costs three francs, and is a very precious record of a fair and unusual
                           type of human character.

                        <p id="d45862e1472">The House of Savoy dates from Humbert Whitehands, a contemporary of Edward the
                           Confessor; and for centuries its members made treaties and intermarried with the
                           House of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="120" data-tei-n="114"> </a></span> France. Not merely were they known as
                           pious people, but as remarkably holy people—five of them were in one age or
                           another canonized by Rome; and on one occasion Pope Gregory the Sixteenth is
                           reported to have exclaimed, “What! 
                           <emph id="d45862e1476">another</emph> beatification in the
                           House of Savoy!” So that in judging the character of Charles Felix, this
                           hereditary strain of devotion has to be taken into account. It limited his point
                           of view, and was partly the secret of his great personal sanctity. It bound
                           every part of his nature like a fine iron wire, and caused him to absolutely
                           ignore all those wide‐spreading and inevitable changes which were rooted in
                           theories he neither shared nor understood. Stupid, Charles Felix was not: he
                           possessed a quick insight and a most tender heart. One feels a vain regret in
                           realizing the apparently useless struggle against an advancing tide, which he
                           carried on from youth to age. Living, he stood like a half‐submerged rock; dead,
                           the waters swept over his tomb. He was but the eleventh child of a family of
                           twelve; a mere little princeling, with no apparent chance of ever coming to any
                           special honour, though his father was Victor<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="121" data-tei-n="115"> </a></span>
                           Amedeo, King of Savoy, and his mother a Spanish princess of the Bourbon line.
                           She lost a favourite brother by small‐pox just before the birth of Charles
                           Felix, and devoted herself with special tenderness to this little boy. After his
                           birth came one more infant brother, so that by the time that Louis the Sixteenth
                           had succeeded his grandfather on the throne of France, Savoy had already three
                           little princes getting their education in Turin, and a much older Crown Prince
                           of twenty. One baby boy had died and also two small princesses, but there still
                           remained nine children who were mostly destined as usual to marry to France.
                           Strange to say, one sister, wedded to the Comte de Provence, died at Gosfield
                           Hall, in Essex, where her husband, who had become King Louis the Eighteenth, was
                           then living in exile; this elder princess was married when Charles Felix was
                           only six years old; and he remembered that in the midst of the wedding
                           festivities he was taken to the theatre for the first time.

                        <p id="d45862e1483">At the age of ten he saw his eldest brother, the Crown Prince, depart for
                           Versailles, to marry Madame Clotilde de France. When the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="122" data-tei-n="116"> </a></span> Prince of Piedmont returned with his bride, the
                           people of Chambèry very impolitely called out, “Oh! how fat she is! How fat she
                           is!” and her good mother‐in‐law, sitting by her side in the royal carriage, said
                           consolingly, “When 
                           <emph id="d45862e1487">I</emph> came here in similar circumstances the people
                           cried out, ‘Oh! how ugly she is! How ugly she is!’” But Clotilde was good and
                           sweet like her sister, Madame Elizabeth, and spoke tenderly to the little
                           brothers, as Charles Felix recalls in a fragment of his lively autobiography.
                           After the wedding, the royal children went back to Montcalieri, a country
                           palace, and there for more than ten years they received a solid and serious
                           education. Charles Felix is reported to have done only one naughty thing in his
                           childhood: having had a taste of the stage at his sister’s wedding, he wanted to
                           see it again. A theatre was attached to the palace, and on the occasion of a new
                           piece being performed, he persuaded a page to leave open a private door, that he
                           might peep in. He found it duly open, but alas! on the other side was a man!
                           Charles Felix tumbled into the arms of his father!

                           in the very next year, that terrible scourge of princes, the inexorable
                           small‐pox of the eighteenth century, carried off the poor young bride. At the
                           age of twenty Charles Felix also lost his mother, and his nature had taken the
                           impress which it ever afterwards retained—an impress of gentle severity and holy
                           peace. It was well for him that he was thus annealed, for days were coming when
                           storms were to break over little Piedmont, storms which in all ranks within that
                           kingdom were hard to bear.

                           old, and Charles Ferdinand, Duc de Berry, somewhat younger. After them followed

                           of Savoy was King, and Angoulème, oddly enough, was Queen. In March, 1791, came
                           two very unhappy women, Mesdames Adelaide and Victoire of France, elderly and
                           bewildered, pausing to visit their niece Clotilde on their way to Rome. Carlyle
                           has given us in his “French Revolution” a grotesque, and, to my thinking,
                           irreverent picture of these old daughters of Louis the Fifteenth. They were
                           close upon sixty, just a year between them; Madame Victoire was tall and ugly,
                           Madame Adelaide was tall and stout, but had a very kind face; both poor ladies
                           were clad in brown stuff gowns and black fichus, and were so utterly scared by
                           the recent scenes at Versailles, that they could hardly abide the sight of
                           strangers, even though these strangers were royal cousins of their own. On
                           crossing the bridge over the river which then divided the territories of France
                           and Piedmont, they had been pursued with jeers and maledictions, while on the
                           Italian side they were received by a guard of honour and drums and trumpets.
                           When the carriage stopped at the gate of the palace of Chambèry,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="125" data-tei-n="119"> </a></span> the King of Savoy handed out Madame Adelaide, who
                           very naturally did not know him, and in her trouble and confusion did not so
                           much as notice the gentleman on whose arm she leant. Great was her distress when
                           she was told he was her royal host, and that she had been wanting in due
                           etiquette. Charles Felix kept a sort of diary, written with quaint, mild
                           vivacity and flashes of humour. It would help us to understand those times much
                           better than we do, if other people had done the same. His point of view was
                           naturally quite different from that of the usual historian. He was the equal of
                           all those of whom he spoke, naming them by their territorial titles—“D’Aosta,
                           Maurrienne, Piedmont, Angoulème,” the latter as the “eldest of the petits
                           d’Artois.” Poor D’Enghien (the youngest of the three Condés) cried when he went
                           away from Chambèry. And in this old court of Sardinia all the elaborate
                           ceremonies and frequent religious functions were kept up with the utmost care;
                           and they are noted down, intermixed with the quaintest revelations of personal
                           character.

                        <p id="d45862e1515">In the midst of that family gathering, Charles Felix’s sister, the Comtesse
                           D’Artois, shut herself<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="126" data-tei-n="120"> </a></span> up in a darkened room,
                           declaring with tears that under no circumstances would she ever return to
                           France, but desired to go straightway into a convent. To which “the Cardinal”
                           replied that as she had a husband and two sons she must do no such thing, and
                           she was obliged to come out and give it up. During all this time M. de Provence
                           and 
                           <emph id="d45862e1519">his</emph> wife, that other sister of Charles Felix, were shut up in
                           Paris, and on the twelfth of July, 1791, Mme. d’Artois received a letter from
                           them, which her brother abridged in his diary, describing how the Princess
                           Josephine (Madame de Provence) stole away on a dark night, apparently from the
                           Tuilleries, and felt her way along the garden wall until she reached a small
                           door where waited Madame de G—. By the help of a man‐servant and that servant’s
                           wife, the two ladies got off out of Paris, and reached Lille, picking up M. de
                           Provence at Mons. This was coincident with the fatal flight of the royal family
                           to Varennes. At Brussels Monsieur and Madame found their younger brother the
                           Comte d’Artois, and the three Condés; but Madame declined to remain, and said
                           she wished to return to her father, the King of Sardinia.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="127" data-tei-n="121"> </a></span> This tender but precise parent said she might come if
                           she came by herself, and he would provide her with a court: “what was certain,”
                           said her brother in his diary, with a faint touch of irony, “was that she had
                           not a halfpenny, and was dying of hunger” at Brussels. She survived, however,
                           many years, and so finally died in England.

                        <p id="d45862e1525">Meantime the threatening storm drew nearer, and the poor little court of Sardinia
                           stood like a sand castle on the shore, in face of the advancing tide. We are
                           accustomed to read of the splendid victories of the armies of France, of the
                           enthusiasm of the Republican troops, of the great race of soldiers bred up in
                           their ranks, generals and marshals of France—their deeds are a poem, an undying
                           legend of glory; their portraits are at Versailles, their names are engraven on
                           the Arc de Triomphe. In the palace of the Tuilleries, the great central hall
                           opening on the balcony under the clock (the familiar clock that is no more!),
                           was known as the

                           the 
                           <emph id="d45862e1532">other</emph> side of the story; how the Republic sent a revolutionary
                           ambassador, M. de Semonville, to Turin; how quarrels were skilfully fostered;
                           how in the winter of 1792 the King of Sardinia sent him back to France; how
                           Paris roared, got her troops together, and finally, in September, invaded
                           helpless little Savoy, while Austria shilly‐shallied, not sorry to see a lamb
                           thrown to the wolf. France pounced on Savoy and Nice, and a weary struggle began
                           which lasted on and off for four years; till Buonaparte, carrying everything
                           before him, halted at a few days’ march from Turin, and the old monarch, Victor
                           Amedeo, the father of so many sons, was summoned to abandon his capital. He
                           ended by giving up Savoy, Nice, Tende, and Beuil, and not unnaturally died in a
                           fit of apoplexy before worse came about. His eldest son, Charles Emmanuel,
                           husband of Clotilde de France, was finally driven off the mainland to the island
                           of Sardinia, and was escorted thither by the English fleet. Before this came to
                           pass, and during the time of bewildering trouble, Charles Felix went on with his
                           private diary, even so late<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="129" data-tei-n="123"> </a></span> as 1798; but there
                           came a day, it was the sixth o{ December, in that year, when he notes that the
                           royal family all sat up in conclave until two o’clock in the morning. On the
                           seventh he writes, “
                           <emph id="d45862e1537">Vendredi. Vivalde, Ch. Bernes</emph>”—these three
                           words and nothing more; the rest of the book is blank white paper, and he seems
                           never to have written again. On the tenth, a Monday morning, the royal family of
                           Sardinia set out very early by torchlight. In the darkness those who first got
                           out of Turin waited anxiously for those who were belated. At last all the young
                           men were got together, and the carriages started for the place of rendezvous by
                           different roads. They intended to meet at Leghorn, but the old king, who had
                           gone round by Florence, fell ill in that city, and there they all waited for two
                           months; not till the twenty‐fourth of February did the English fleet take them
                           in charge and land them in Cagliari, where the people received them with joy and
                           greeting, and where Charles Felix was destined to dwell for sixteen years
                           without ever revisiting his native Piedmont. He went there a young prince, he
                           left it a man of forty, soon to be a king. How they all got on in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="130" data-tei-n="124"> </a></span> the interval can be shortly told, for one sorrow
                           after another fell on the House of Savoy. The old king died on the mainland and
                           was taken to be buried at Montcalieri. When his sons went into exile on the
                           island, Charles Emmanuel took with him a troop of Piedmontese retainers, and
                           settled into an old building near the cathedral of Cagliari, and made of it his
                           palace, while the Archbishop made room for Charles Felix, who chose for his
                           household only native Sardinians. Hardly were they all established when a little
                           boy, son of the Duke d’Aosta, and sole male heir of all the brothers, died at
                           the age of five. Next came the death of Maurice, Duke de Montférat, who caught a
                           violent cold and fever on a night voyage, and perished at the age of
                           thirty‐four. During these events the mainland of Italy was overrun by Austrians,
                           Russians, and French. The misfortunes of Piedmont culminated in Napoleon’s
                           famous victory at Marengo, on the 14th of June, 1800, after which Charles Felix
                           gave his native country up for lost. The new king “Piedmont” had bad health, his
                           dearly loved wife, Clotilde de France, had died, and he said he could no longer
                           “bear his Crown of Thorns;” he<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="131" data-tei-n="125"> </a></span> abdicated and
                           went away to Rome to live, and his next brother, Victor Emmanuel, then became
                           king. A ray of relief in the gloomy tragedy of these years is given by the
                           passage across the scene of the well‐known Frenchman, Count Joseph de Maistre,
                           who came and lived for a time with Charles Felix at Cagliari. The sight of his
                           name in the sad pathetic pages is like a breath of air from the outer world.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e1546">Finally the youngest of all the brothers, the “dear, dear child” of the wise
                           Charles Felix (but one year older) died quite suddenly, apparently of the usual
                           fever, and this last blow quite upset the nerve of the Viceroy of Sardinia.
                           Affection for Mauria (the Comte de Maurrienne) is the dominant note of the first
                           half of the book; the two had been educated together, in the strict monastic
                           manner of that old court; they had suffered insult, and what they felt to be
                           very bitter exile in common. “Dear, dear child, I love you more than myself and
                           more than anything else on earth,” says one letter; and in another, “They tell
                           me to preach to you because you work too much; take care of yourself, for the
                           whole world is not worth your little finger; you are<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="132" data-tei-n="126"> </a></span> all that is good, and I am

                           <foreign id="d45862e1553" xml:lang="fre">patois</foreign> for general worthlessness.

                        <p id="d45862e1558">And so, when Mauria died, Charles Felix for the first and last time quailed
                           before the storm. He fell into black melancholy and was got off to Rome, where
                           he besought the Pope to favour his entering a monastery, an old and ardent
                           desire of his youth. But the Holy Father expressed a strong desire that the
                           Prince should remain in the world, for the House of Savoy was dwindling away
                           visibly. He then tried to get out of being any longer Viceroy; but to this his
                           brother the King was equally opposed; and worse befell, for he was implored to
                           enter the marriage state! There were now but three of his brothers living; the
                           original Prince of Piedmont, who had abdicated; Victor Emmanuel (Aosta), who had
                           lost his only boy; and Charles Felix himself, who was by this time seven and
                           thirty. They sent him back to Sardinia to consider the matter; and there, as
                           ever, and more than ever, he lived the life of a saint, giving up his revenue
                           for the poor, rounding a dispensary with a doctor and a surgeon attached, which
                           has survived all dangers, and is still to be found at<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="133" data-tei-n="127"> </a></span> Cagliari, and devoting time, thought, and money to

                           no more suitable wife than the Princesse Marie Christine of Naples, the niece of
                           Marie Antoinette, and great aunt of the Comte de Paris. But here again there was
                           a difficulty, for the Princess, who was six‐and‐twenty, said that she on her
                           side did not wish to marry; she had already refused several suitable alliances,
                           and the most the ambassador could obtain from her was that she must take some
                           time to consider; and it was six weeks before she would ratify the consent given

                           she had certainly never any cause to repent. Charles Felix wrote her a very
                           pretty letter, in which he tells her that he will always try to make her happy,
                           and says further that he hopes she will be pleased to accept the “seules
                           expressions” which he is as yet allowed to make use of, when he signs himself
                           her very affectionate cousin, Charles Felix. The short letter is perfumed with
                           the bloom of good wishes and sincere resolves. The Pope blessed him, and prayed
                           that he might give a numerous offspring to the House of Savoy. But, alas! Heaven
                           denied the prayer, and a painful omen befell in the loss by shipwreck of four
                           thousand pounds worth of diamonds, which he ordered from England for his bride.
                           They are at the bottom of the sea! He told a friend that she had “enough of her
                           own,” and so went off to Palermo to be married to her whom he afterwards called
                           his “Dear Wife,” and who showed in subsequent years the firmness and real
                           goodness of her sister Marie Amélie, the Queen of the French, and seems to have
                           become much loved by Charles Felix.

                           the lives<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="135" data-tei-n="129"> </a></span> of saints, keeping a modest court
                           and doing good with the right and the left hand. The chief incident was the
                           stamping out of a violent epidemic fever, during which Charles Felix worked
                           incessantly with the medical men, and when his relatives sent an English ship to
                           fetch him away, he refused to leave, or to let her touch at the port of Cagliari
                           and so incur quarantine. During these years poor little Piedmont floated about,
                           a derelict on the stormy waters of European politics. Sometimes the King saw a
                           chance of getting back to Turin, and then his hopes would be rudely upset.
                           Austria, having married Marie Therèse to Napoleon, was no longer to be counted
                           as a friend; the King of Naples lived in Sicily, and every change in French
                           affairs had a contrecoup in the Italian Peninsula. During the Hundred Days, when
                           the French Royal Family left Paris, Charles Felix did his best to keep his
                           wife’s mind easy about her relatives, and curious paragraphs indicate their
                           distance from the centre of affairs; Christine counting the days to prove that
                           the bad news could not possibly, if true, have become known. But it was true
                           nevertheless.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="136" data-tei-n="130"> </a></span> At last, however, Waterloo
                           put an end to Napoleon, and under the treaties of the Allied Sovereigns the
                           Royal Family of Piedmont all went back to Turin, after years of exile.

                        <p id="d45862e1578">Now began a new state of matters, which it is extremely interesting to see from
                           the inside. The King had no male heir, and Charles Felix, alas! had no child;
                           and the next in succession to the throne of Savoy and Piedmont was a very far
                           away cousin, the Prince de Carignan. We knew him many years later as Charles
                           Albert, an heroic fighter against the Austrians, but in 1815 he was a very young
                           man, whose father had died when he was only two years old, and he had
                           consequently received his education from a mother who shared none of the
                           opinions and prejudices of the old House of Savoy; she lived firstly at Dresden
                           and afterwards at Geneva, and at the age of fifteen her son received from
                           Bonaparte a lieutenancy in a regiment of dragoons. When the fall of the Emperor
                           cast this youth into the bosom of the Royal Family at Turin, it may be imagined
                           that the excellent old cousins did not know what to do with him. And yet he was
                           the heir!

                        <p id="d45862e1581">Charles Felix, in spite of his profound personal<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="137" data-tei-n="131"> </a></span> piety, had a wider outlook on life than the rest of his House; and he was
                           more hopeful for and indulgent to the Prince de Carignan than was the King. But
                           for the disparity between their ages, he might probably have won him, and saved
                           him from those associations with the Carbonari which were matters of danger in
                           Charles Albert’s later life, when it used to be said that he was in constant
                           fear of assassination from the companions of his youth.

                           sincerely to hold friendly relations with the young couple; Charles Felix, in
                           particular, did his best to soften the severer and narrower judgment of the
                           King. Meanwhile political intrigues and popular demands were threatening to
                           overwhelm the ancient Monarchical Constitution, and in 1821 the King felt he
                           could bear the situation no longer, and suddenly abdicated, as had done the
                           original Prince of Piedmont. Charles Felix, who did not lack firmness, accepted
                           the heavy task; and for ten years he literally set his back against the wall,
                           and fought for the old ideas and the ancient laws of Savoy. A weaker<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="138" data-tei-n="132"> </a></span> man or a more foolish man would have succumbed from
                           the mere worry. The hero prince “held the fort” for Jesus, King of men.

                           peace with his old cousin.

                           The modest dignity of the royal Court, the expenses perpetually cut down in the
                           cause of charity, the minute pains with which the people were cared for, the
                           encouragement given to learning, the restoration of Hautecombe (though it cannot
                           be said that the architecture rivals that of the Middle Ages), and, above all,
                           the personal holiness of the man at the helm of the Ship of State, make a
                           beautiful picture, however opposed to the popular English sympathy of to‐day.
                           There is nothing in the coarse common‐sense of Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy,
                           nothing in the verbose eloquence and shady private life of Garibaldi, to compare
                           for a moment with the character or the language of the last King of Savoy. One

                           marry his mistress lest he should die without the sacraments, and Garibaldi
                           getting into troubles which were an open secret, and pouring forth torrents of
                           inflated prose, seem to me very poor men indeed compared to noble, chaste, firm
                           Charles Felix.

                           chants of the Water Funeral were echoed back from the mountains, and the people
                           he had governed were stirred as when a saint is gone. And so little could the
                           Princes of Carignan keep up the old glories of their place and state, that Savoy
                           is now a French province, Royal Chambèry the head of a Prefecture, Nice a
                           possession of France, and the King of Italy leads an uneasy life in his capital,

                              the head. She dropped and expired without a groan. His intent was instantly
                              to destroy himself, but in that he failed, and endeavouring to make his
                              escape, he was secured and committed to prison. He appeared to be perfectly
                              in his senses, and endeavoured to justify the act by a sudden impulse that
                              for a moment convulsed his mind. The deceased for more than sixteen years
                              had been connected with Lord Sandwich, and had been the mother of nine

                              a mantua‐maker in Clerkenwell. This murder affords a melancholy proof that
                              there is no act contrary to reason that reasonable men will not commit when
                              under the dominion of their passions. It is impossible to convey an idea of
                              the impression made on all ranks of people when it was first reported; the
                              manner of it struck every feeling heart with horror.”<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="144" data-tei-n="138"> </a></span> Such was the very human utterance of Sylvanus
                              Urban, avoiding all reproach of the unfortunate mother of so many young
                              children, who expiated her fault by so dreadful a fate. The street ballad,
                              of the epoch which then usually commemorated events striking to the popular
                              imagination, touches the same key, and Grub Street furnished a long poem on
                              the death of Miss Ray; one verse of it, quoted by Thackeray, ends with a

                           <p id="d45862e1666">It must be added that it would be unfair for the cloth to suffer in
                              reputation for Hackman’s atrocious deed. He had held His Majesty’s
                              Commission, and it was as a soldier that he first met Miss Ray, at
                              Hinchinbrooke, and he sold out in pursuance of the object of his admiration.
                              Why he took orders, how he obtained ordination, and why he should have
                              imagined that by such extraordinary and disreputable plotting he could
                              succeed in winning Miss Ray away from her children and their father, is one
                              of those mysteries which surround the sphere of madness. At the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="145" data-tei-n="139"> </a></span> inquest, which was very fully reported on the
                              next page of the magazine, Hackman seems to have made no effort at
                              self‐defence, simply saying that jealousy had driven him mad. A Mr.
                              Macnamara appeared as principal witness, and described how he had taken Miss
                              Ray upon his arm in order to lead her to the carriage sent by Lord Sandwich,
                              how he had suddenly felt the shock and the noise of the explosion, and the
                              movement of the lady dropping on the pavement, dead! The pistol had been
                              fired close to the back of her head.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1672">Hackman was of course condemned, and suffered at Tyburn Tree on the 19th of
                              April, whither he was taken in a mourning coach accompanied by the chaplain
                              of Newgate, a sheriff’s officer, and James Boswell of Auchinlick. Lord
                              Carlisle also attended the execution, and gave an account of it to George
                              Selwyn which is to be found in Selwyn’s correspondence. Hackman stated that
                              he had taken the pistol with the intent of committing suicide, but had been
                              maddened by jealousy at the sight of Mr. Macnamara. Such was the poor crazy
                              criminal whose deed filled all London with horror, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="146" data-tei-n="140"> </a></span> orphaned a house full of children, causing the
                              people of that day to overlook the irregularities of Miss Ray’s life in
                              their pity for her tragical fate.

                           <p id="d45862e1677">It is wonderful and instructive to note that in the official life of Lord
                              Sandwich, written by his domestic chaplain, the great minister is lauded as
                              a model of all the virtues, in language which only the pompous diction of
                              the last century could supply. He was sixty when this awful tragedy befell
                              him, and survived to the age of seventy‐three, dying younger than did his
                              son Basil. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, born to him by his
                              third wife, Dorothy Fane, which son became a man of no particular
                              importance; but Basil rose to great eminence, and Basil’s brother became
                              Admiral Montagu, while the only surviving sister married the Sardinian
                              Ambassador, Comte de Viry.

                           <p id="d45862e1680">It was probably one result of the mother’s melancholy death that Lord
                              Sandwich thenceforth brought up the children of his dead mistress as kings
                              have brought up their offspring, giving them his name, and, so far as he
                              could, the advantages of his own rank. Basil’s name is deeply writ on the
                              Statute Book of England,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="147" data-tei-n="141"> </a></span> while from the
                              Sardinian marriage sprang a train of curious circumstances, of which “The
                              Lost Chord” survives as an echo of the Catholic marriage of Madame de
                              Viry.

                           <p id="d45862e1685">It should be also recorded by the truthful historian that pious proper George
                              the Third was much attached to Lord Sandwich, and twice visited the fleet
                              while that nobleman was at the head of the Admiralty. In this connection an
                              anecdote is told (but not by the chaplain) of the inquisitive monarch. He
                              asked to taste the pork and pease soup on which the equipage of a certain
                              man‐of‐war was about to dine. Lord Sandwich sent a message to the purser,
                              who sent word back that he could not “victual any man in a King’s ship
                              without a warrant from the captain.” This was obtained in due form, and
                              accompanied with the request that a nice piece of pork should be selected
                              for his Majesty. The crusty purser declared that this was against all rule.
                              Either the King or the First Lord of the Admiralty must “prick in the tub
                              and take pot luck.”

                           <p id="d45862e1688">Returning to Basil Montagu (still a familiar figure when our Queen was
                              young), he was in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="148" data-tei-n="142"> </a></span> due time sent by his
                              father to Oxford, and thence to the Bar. While at college and under
                              twenty‐one, he made a runaway marriage with a baronet’s daughter. I forget
                              her name, but he used to talk about her to me with much frankness. The young
                              wife died in child‐birth, leaving a son, also named Basil, who grew up to
                              manhood. The boyish father was heartbroken at her loss, and told, in his old
                              age, how he spent the days thinking about her, and the nights in lying upon
                              her grave. “But,” said he, with old‐fashioned precision, “I reflected, my
                              dear, that such indulgence in grief would never do; so I made a resolution
                              to think of my wife for a quarter of an hour less every day, and I did so
                              (
                              <emph id="d45862e1692">impressively</emph>); and so at last I was cured of my sorrow.”
                              It is half a century since this narrative of a grief‐cure was given, but the
                              quotation of the strange recipe is exact.

                           <p id="d45862e1696">At the Bar Mr. Montagu built up a great reputation. He was intimately
                              associated with Sir Samuel Romilly in successful efforts to abolish the
                              punishment of death for those numerous offences, far short of murder, for
                              which it was then pitilessly exacted. Together<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="149" data-tei-n="143"> </a></span> they waged a long and successful crusade. Of the
                              state of the law and the astounding callousness of the British judge at the
                              beginning of this century, the following letter bears evidence, and is worth
                              many statistics. In 1810 Sir Samuel received a letter signed Stephen R.
                              Amwell, informing him that in passing through Maidstone, the writer had
                              learned that three men, all convicted for slight offences, had been left for
                              execution by the judge. One of them, Lawes by name, who had stolen property
                              worth forty shillings, might be thought to have some claim to mercy because
                              a bill to repeal in such cases the punishment of death was actually pending
                              in Parliament. The man was to be hanged on the day following the receipt of
                              the letter. Sir Samuel hastened to the Secretary of State, and he without
                              delay sent on Amwell’s letter to Judge Heath. Here is the judge’s
                              answer:—
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1702">“Sir,—I have received and read the letter with the signature of Amwell, and
                              by some passages I am confident that he wrote me a letter, signed Amicus
                              Curiæ, respecting Lawes. As for Lawes, he was guilty of house‐breaking,
                              and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="150" data-tei-n="144"> </a></span> most probably burglary, in the
                              dwelling house of Mary Wilkins, a widow woman, who carries on the business
                              of baker at Minster, and stole plate to the value of £20 and upwards, to the
                              best of my recollection. As housebreaking has been frequent in Kent and no
                              person appeared to give him a character, I left him for execution. Stephen
                              Nichols was convicted of stealing two heifers, which the prisoner and his
                              brother, who has absconded, pretended to have bought for £34. They were
                              driven from the close of a poor widow woman whose property they were, and
                              slaughtered by the prisoner.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1707">“The third is Peter Presnel, who was convicted for breaking into the cottage
                              of John Orpin, no persons being therein, and stealing therein property to
                              the value of five shillings; in fact, the things were of the value of forty
                              shillings. It was found that the cottage was broken into while the
                              prosecutor was absent at his labour, and all the valuable things were stolen
                              by the prisoner. I consider this offence the worst of all, because, if not
                              checked, it would destroy all parsimony and frugality among cottagers. In
                              truth, I tried ninety‐nine prisoners at<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="151" data-tei-n="145"> </a></span>

                              rolls of paper, which were pasted together till they were of the size of a
                              small sheet. On these Mr. Montagu would print in huge capitals the names of
                              the Cardinal Virtues. I understood at the time that these had some
                              connection with Lord Bacon! It is not my impression that Mr. Montagu was
                              particularly gifted with devotion to the Counsels of Perfection, but to this
                              day I cannot see Truth and Temperance printed on a handbill in Roman letters
                              without thinking of my dear old friend. I do not know what purpose he had in
                              view, but I can hardly think that so important a personage intended to
                              deliver a lecture to any audience lower in status than the assembled
                              Bar!

                           <p id="d45862e1748">Quite towards his closing years Mr. Montagu suffered some reverse of fortune
                              which must have been caused by younger members of his family. The little
                              establishment at Storey’s Gate was broken up, and he and his wife retired to
                              France. I last saw him waving a good‐bye to my parents on the pier of
                              Boulogne, He was buried in the cemetery on the St. Omer<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="153" data-tei-n="147"> </a></span> Road, with one short line of noble epitaph, well
                              deserved, for he had certainly used his life of labour for the cause of
                              Justice and Liberty and the happiness of Mankind.

                           <p id="d45862e1759">It is difficult to attempt the portrait of any one who has already been
                              described by Carlyle. He threw all his impressions on paper with a touch of
                              unconscious virulence, so that even his best‐loved heroes, even Oliver
                              himself, disclosed under his revelations a cruel or a distressful side. I
                              knew that beautiful lady of Carlyle’s description very well, as the young
                              know the old; and I knew her for the course of many years, for Mrs. Montagu
                              long survived her husband, and, returning to England, lived to a great age
                              in the house of her daughter, Mrs. Procter. Whatever sorrows she had to
                              bear, and they were neither few nor slight, she bore them in silence with a
                              splendid courage, and did her best for all around her. No woman of our time
                              could have had more reason to feel outraged by any allusion to her private
                              griefs, and when I look up at the windows of the little house in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="154" data-tei-n="148"> </a></span> Storey’s Gate, where I once spent long hours,
                              listening with enthusiasm to her wise and kindly wisdom, I feel amazement
                              after a lapse of a long half‐century that the image of such a wife and
                              mother should remain associated with the unredressed insults of Carlyle’s
                              ungrateful pen. But to this subject I must needs return when I come to speak
                              of her daughter, Mrs. Procter.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1764">Mrs. Montagu’s maiden name was Benson, and she came from the same family
                              stock as the present Archbishop of Canterbury. She was born in York. I do
                              not know what was the occupation of her father, but I have reason to believe
                              that her uncle was incumbent of the living of Bolton on the Wharfe, and that
                              by him, and in his parish church, she was early married to a young lawyer
                              named Skepper, a lineal descendant of the second partner of the famous firm
                              of Fust and Scheffer, the earliest printers. This marriage must have
                              occurred shortly before the year 1800. Mr. Skepper died early, and when
                              Basil Montagu met the young widow, which I have always supposed to have
                              happened while he was on the Northern Circuit,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="155" data-tei-n="149"> </a></span> her little Anne was a very young child. I have no
                              record of the place or date of Mrs. Skepper’s marriage to Mr. Montagu. My
                              father’s first memory of her referred to her as installed in the large
                              house, No. 25, Bedford Square, where the children of his two previous
                              marriages were gathered, nor do I know anything about Mr. Montagu’s second
                              wife, who died prematurely, leaving, I think, two sons. Little Anne Skepper
                              was thus brought up in the house of her stepfather, and could recall no
                              other parent; she ever regarded him with profound respect and warm
                              affection, and was a true sister in all her dealings with the other children
                              of that complicated family. Mrs. Montagu was at all ages a most beautiful
                              person; the only figure which in any way recalls her to me is the well‐known
                              portrait of Mrs. Siddons as Queen Catherine. Speaking of Anne Skepper’s
                              marriage to the poet Mr. Procter, then better known as Barry Cornwall, Mr.
                              Coventry Patmore, who knew them all, says, “That a poet could hardly have
                              aspired to a greater temporal reward than the friendship of the Basil
                              Montagus and the hand of their daughter will not be questioned by any of
                              the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="156" data-tei-n="150"> </a></span> many living persons who have had
                              the happiness of knowing the family. No young man who understood what honour
                              meant, and none understood it better than the high‐minded and sensitive
                              young poet, could think that fame had in store for him any favour which
                              could surpass or equal those which she was now conferring on him. Hence,
                              perhaps, the sudden and final extinction of his literary ambition, which
                              seemed to occur about this time, notwithstanding an amount of popular
                              encouragement that, under ordinary circumstances, was calculated to fire him
                              to redoubled exertions. The manners, at once stately and genial, of Mr.
                              Basil Montagu and his wife have few or no counterpart in modern society. The
                              stateliness was not that of reserve but of truth in action, and the
                              geniality arose, not from easy good‐humour, but from earnest goodwill. Of
                              Mrs. Basil Montagu it may indeed be said that for a young man to know her
                              was an education. Even at a time when her great personal beauty was slightly
                              (it was never more than slightly) obscured by age, there was that about her
                              that no well‐disposed and imaginative young man could long behold without
                              feeling<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="157" data-tei-n="151"> </a></span> that he was committed thereby
                              to leading a worthy life. If the reader is inclined to smile at this praise
                              as somewhat obsolete in its mode, let him be assured by one who knew Mrs.
                              Montagu that it seems so only because that style of woman is obsolete.”

                           <p id="d45862e1773">I have quoted at length this page from Mr. Coventry Patmore’s biography of
                              Mr. Procter because there are now left so few people who can recall the
                              Montagu household. It was in the little drawing‐room at Storey’s Gate that I
                              first met Mr. Patmore. He had just published his first book.

                           <p id="d45862e1776">Mrs. Montagu’s great personal beauty and distinction were heightened by the
                              pains which she took with her peculiar dress; it was almost that of a “Plain
                              Friend,” and recalled the aspect of Elizabeth Fry. She never indulged in
                              more than three dresses, and the material was black satin, which in the
                              years when I first remember her (in the Forties) was very much in vogue. I
                              imagine that she must have allowed herself one new dress every year, and she
                              wore the three in strict and careful rotation. The costume was cut low and
                              square in front, as in so many of the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="158" data-tei-n="152"> </a></span>
                              portraits of Reynolds and Gainsborough; ample folds of white muslin met the
                              dress, and, mounting to the chin, encircled her fine old face and head in
                              beautiful pleats; the effect was that of a cap, but I do not know how it was
                              managed, and it was a standing jest among her intimate friends that no one
                              could ever divine the 
                              <foreign id="d45862e1780" xml:lang="lat">modus operandi</foreign> of
                              Mrs. Montagu’s toilet. I believe that the robe was cunningly fastened upon
                              the shoulder, and the point of junction concealed under a fold of black
                              satin. I have often seen her clear starching and ironing out the voluminous
                              folds of white muslin with her own stately hands. The effect of the whole
                              costume was charming to behold.

                           <p id="d45862e1785">She wrote a remarkably beautiful Italian hand, or rather what we now know as
                              the Elizabethan writing, the stems of the letters serried together, and the
                              letters themselves wide apart. Every word was plainly separate. In her old
                              age she was fond of teaching writing to her young friends. She would not
                              tolerate a blot upon the page, and she abhorred a word of slang in
                              conversation. It was just the time when Boz and Pickwick had started fresh
                              forms of speech<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="159" data-tei-n="153"> </a></span> among the new generation
                              of young men and maidens, and I regret to say that they occasionally fell
                              with her into deep disgrace! No one ever gave me so much the impression of a
                              moral soldier under arms as Mrs. Basil Montagu. About a month before her
                              death her son‐in‐law went upstairs to pay her a visit in her private
                              sitting‐room. He came down and said to Mrs. Procter “My dear Anne, your
                              mother must be ill; she has allowed herself to cough in my presence.” During
                              that last thirty days, Mrs. Montagu sat up quietly reading as usual; she was
                              a religious woman, and when she could no longer go out to church, she read
                              her books of devotion steadily at home, but her daughter one day, standing
                              softly behind her, saw that 
                              <emph id="d45862e1789">the book was upside down</emph> in her
                              mother’s hand. When at length one Friday morning the brave old lady could no
                              longer rise and sit in her accustomed arm‐chair, it was the first time that
                              her granddaughter, Adelaide Procter, had ever seen her head recumbent upon
                              its pillow. In three days she had quietly passed away, and for all those,
                              now few in number, who can still familiarly remember her, the name of Anne
                              Benson Montagu recalls<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="160" data-tei-n="154"> </a></span> an image of
                              majestic beauty and dauntless moral courage of which Englishwomen may well

                              Carlyle refers to her as having made “a considerable foreign marriage;”
                              about which he evidently knew nothing, for it was not in any way a
                              legitimate subject for his covert sneer.

                           <p id="d45862e1798">Emily Montagu was born in Bedford Square, and was, I think, about fifteen
                              years younger than her half‐sister Anne, who felt for her an affection which
                              was one of the softest points in Mrs. Procter’s character. I only saw her at
                              one epoch, when, in middle age and a second time widowed, she came back to
                              England to see her mother, then living in Mr. Procter’s household. This was
                              her story.

                              dowered by him, eventually married the Sardinian Ambassador, Comte de Viry.
                              She disappeared from England, and over Sardinia and Savoy swept the great
                              storm of the French Revolution, during which the House of Savoy took

                              Waterloo; and after a ten years’ reign, he died a holy death, and his coffin
                              was conveyed in a “Water Funeral” across the Lake of Bourget (close to
                              Aix‐les‐Bains) and laid in the abbey church of Hautecombe, where his
                              forefathers had also been buried. Hautecombe is still considered an isolated
                              point of Italian soil. To Charles Felix succeeded his distant cousin, the
                              Prince de Carignan, whom we know as Carlo Alberto, and it was during the
                              reign of that liberal king that two young Sardinian gentlemen came over to
                              the Embassy in London, whose names were Comte William de Viry and Comte
                              Adrien de Revel. The first‐named was, of course, nephew to Basil Montagu,
                              and both of them were attracted to the refined, gentle daughter of the
                              household. Emily Montagu preferred her cousin, but there were difficulties,
                              probably arising from unwillingness on the part of the parents to part with
                              their only girl. Comte de Revel at this juncture conquered his own feelings,
                              and did<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="162" data-tei-n="156"> </a></span> his best to promote his friend’s
                              happiness. Presently the family opposition was surmounted, and Miss Montagu
                              became Comtesse William de Viry, and went away with her husband to Turin.
                              This was about the year 1840. But the marriage was of short duration; Comte
                              William died early, leaving two very young children, a boy and a girl. The
                              boy was the king’s godson, and destined to be a royal page; he was named
                              Alberto, and was his mother’s darling. Then began a long renewed courtship
                              on the part of Comte Adrien de Revel, a courtship of romantic tenderness and
                              very little hope, for de Revel was sent on foreign missions, St. Petersburg
                              always looming in the distance, and Alberto could not legally leave Italy,
                              and Comtesse William de Viry refused to listen to her faithful lover until
                              both were middle‐aged. At last, when Alberto was fifteen, and some change
                              was made in the boy’s position and education, his mother gave way. Adrien de
                              Revel obtained his lifelong desire, and they were married at Turin, where
                              the Court to which they were attached habitually resided. After the ceremony
                              they went to Genoa for their honeymoon, intending to return<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="163" data-tei-n="157"> </a></span> shortly to the capital and their usual duties,
                              for both of them were of an ideal strain, and fidelity to all their
                              engagements was with both the habit of their lives. The long‐deferred
                              wedding had taken place on a Wednesday, and on the next Monday morning Comte
                              de Revel awoke at early dawn in the grip of the Cholera Fiend, then hovering
                              over Europe. Nothing availed to save him. There were only twenty lives lost
                              in Genoa, but his, alas! was one.

                              faithful mother, and also the two children whom they had reared from their
                              early orphanhood. Alberto became a soldier, and his sister eventually
                              entered a convent. Madame de Revel did not survive many years, but I have
                              only a vague memory of the news of her death coming to London, and of the
                              grief caused by it to the English relatives who had always loved her
                              well.

                              their household was<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="164" data-tei-n="158"> </a></span> known to so many
                              surviving friends, that it is only fitting their names should precede her
                              own, although she achieved a greater fame; yet there were years when “Barry
                              Cornwall” was known to all, and when his songs were sung all over England.
                              Two of them, “The sea, the sea, the open sea,” and the “Return of the
                              Admiral,” have their permanent place, though many of his charming and poetic
                              pages have sunk into comparative oblivion. In his own person he was a
                              refined and somewhat silent man, with a head said to resemble Sir Walter
                              Scott’s in miniature, and he was extremely beloved by the literary world.
                              But he lived an interior life, into which, I think, none but his wife ever
                              penetrated. He was profoundly attached to her, and she was for ever
                              shielding him from the wind that blew too roughly. He had many sorrows, and
                              death twice visited his household under most pathetic circumstances. To ward
                              off blows from “Brian” and to sustain him with her own abundant strength,
                              was Mrs. Procter’s constant care, and in this she showed a side of her
                              character wholly unsuspected by the outer world.

                           <p id="d45862e1826">Mr. Procter was born so long ago as 1787, and was not far from forty when he
                              married the lovely girl, Anne Skepper, who had been brought up in the home
                              of her stepfather, Basil Montagu. Bryan Walter Procter came from the North
                              of England. He was educated at Harrow, and spent his holidays at the house
                              of a great‐uncle who lived about a dozen miles from London; and his first
                              real instructress in literature was a female servant, born in a better
                              station of life, who had read Richardson and Fielding and worshipped
                              Shakespeare. She used to recite whole scenes to the boy, and encouraged him
                              to buy a Shakespeare of his own. “But,” says he, “I had not leisure to study
                              and worship my Shakespeare long, for at the end of a month or six weeks my
                              destiny drove me back to school.” There he had two schoolfellows, boys named
                              Robert Peel and George Gordon Byron. Of Byron, Mr. Procter says that he then
                              showed no signs of poetic grace. “He was loud, even coarse, and very capable
                              of a boy’s vulgar enjoyments. He played at hockey and racquets, and was
                              occasionally engaged in pugilistic encounters.” Of himself he says he was
                              neither<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="166" data-tei-n="160"> </a></span> very short nor very tall,
                              neither handsome nor hideous. He survived Byron for fifty years, seeing the
                              dawn, the zenith, and the partial oblivion of his fame.

                              the poet and the lover of Italian art; and by another letter about the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="167" data-tei-n="161"> </a></span> Indian Mutiny, in which “Our son (the
                              only son I have, indeed) escaped from Delhi.” He tells how this young man,
                              left to him after the death of his eldest boy Edward, had been in Delhi, and
                              how he and four or five other officers, four women, and a child, escaped.
                              The men were “obliged to drop the women a fearful height from the walls of
                              the fort amidst showers of bullets. They were seven days and seven nights in
                              the jungle without money or meat, scarcely any clothes, no shoes. They
                              forded rivers, lay on the wet ground at night, lapped water from the
                              puddles, and finally reached Meerut.”

                              eventually a general, and, returning to England, survived his father, but
                              predeceased his mother, who, indeed, lost successively all her children save

                           <p id="d45862e1861">Of Mrs. Procter much will inevitably be written in future years. She was a
                              very remarkable person, and lived in possession of almost unbroken health
                              and faculties until nearly ninety. As a girl (“my dearest girl,” writes
                              the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="168" data-tei-n="162"> </a></span> poet during his betrothal) she had
                              been extremely pretty. She was an early playmate of my mother’s, but my
                              memory of her dates from her middle age, and extends over nearly fifty
                              years. She was the daughter by a first marriage of Mrs. Basil Montagu, and
                              always spoke of her mother with the greatest reverence. But of the race of
                              poets to which she was inextricably bound, she spoke with a half‐laughing
                              satire. One was evidently her life‐long lover, and one was her child, and
                              several others clustered about her like bees. She did not exactly hold a
                              salon; there was no great fortune in the household, nor any sort of
                              pretension whatever, and Mrs. Procter gave one the impression of having her
                              hands very full; but everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to
                              flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the
                              Dickens, the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong
                              to the place. Three of the daughters became Catholic, and Mrs. Procter, who,
                              I imagine, did not dwell much on the next world, stood between them and the
                              sensitive father, to whom the loss of close union was a great misery. I used
                              to think it infinitely<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="169" data-tei-n="163"> </a></span> touching to see
                              Mrs. Procter trying to harmonize the household. If “Brian” could be kept
                              cheerful and if nobody was ill (and, alas! somebody was very often ill),
                              then the quick vivid mother of the family seemed content. She had a habit of
                              going into the world, a habit of dressing fashionably, a habit of writing
                              the nearest and most concise notes possible; but her consistent, steady
                              kindness had assuredly some deep spiritual root, of which she never spoke.
                              Like her mother, she never abdicated for a moment her great 
                              <foreign id="d45862e1867" xml:lang="fre">tenue</foreign>, never kept her room, never lowered the
                              scale of her dress, never lost her composure; I should doubt if in sixty
                              years a meal had ever been placed upon the table which she had not herself
                              ordered. It was my fate to be very closely associated with her under
                              circumstances in which ninety‐nine people out of a hundred would have broken
                              down, and yet when she lost her daughters, it was their friend whom she
                              tried to spare. I particularly remember her taking me with her to the
                              Catholic cemetery in Kensal Green to plant a quantity of ivy on Adelaide’s
                              grave. I can see her kneeling at the headstone, twisting the sprays, with a

                              That grave is now a place of pilgrimage to American and Colonial travellers.
                              It is thickly overgrown with ivy, but nobody guesses that the mother planted
                              it herself.

                           <p id="d45862e1873">Many years afterwards, Edythe Procter died very suddenly—indeed, in a manner
                              truly tragical—failure of the heart’s action. Mrs. Procter was then more
                              than eighty; and before the announcement could traverse the Continent in the
                              newspapers, came a careful letter, addressed to a delicate friend at
                              Mentone, and on the corner of the envelope two tiny, neatly‐written words,
                              “
                              <emph id="d45862e1875">Bad News</emph>.”

                           <p id="d45862e1879">Such were the environments of Adelaide Procter’s life—a short life, for she
                              died at the age of thirty‐eight. Of outward incidents, apart from the sudden
                              blossoming of her literary fame, there were scarcely any. The year spent in
                              Italy, where her aunt, Madame de Viry, was attached to the Court circle at
                              Turin, was certainly a determining influence on her life. Emily de Viry had
                              become a devout Catholic, and at that time the saintly wife of Victor
                              Emmanuel was living. The example impressed<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="171" data-tei-n="165"> </a></span>
                              Adelaide’s mind, and doubtless contributed to her religious change. At
                              Aix‐les‐Bains is a large portrait 
                              <foreign id="d45862e1883" xml:lang="fre">en pied</foreign>
                              of the young Queen of Sardinia in her bridal dress. It looks, at first
                              sight, to be a purely conventional picture, but the eyes are of a haunting
                              depth. They recall a word‐picture of the Queen returning from Holy
                              Communion, which Adelaide Procter gave. The wife of Victor Emmanuel was
                              passing along one of the galleries of the Palace, her face “shining as with
                              an interior lamp,” when she was met by the young English girl, who never
                              forgot the sight. Of this association Adelaide Procter always bore the
                              trace. In her religious attitude she resembled a foreign rather than an
                              English Catholic. She looked like a Frenchwoman mounting the steps of the
                              Madeleine, or a veiled Italian in St. Peter’s. The one thing she never
                              mentioned was her own conversion.

                              Sisters of Mercy; and in looking back to our childhood I best remember her,
                              as the nearer to my own age.

                              Gate; and in this house it must have been that two children were sitting by
                              the fireside one evening. There was no other light in the room, and Agnes
                              Procter (Sister Mary Francis) suddenly made a confidence; saying, in a tone
                              of intense childish conviction, “I do love mama.” These words made an
                              ineffaceable impression on the hearer, for the little speaker was never
                              supposed to be at all imaginative, and certainly Mrs. Procter did

                              reverse—though her intimates knew her for a very good and kind one. And the
                              last time that I saw Sister Mary Francis she was kneeling by that mother’s
                              open grave at Kensal Green, her sincere, gentle face, under its veil,
                              looking but little changed since the day of her profession some thirty years
                              before. It may not be irrelevant to add that shortly after her somewhat
                              unexpected death after a few days’ illness, the Reverend Mother spoke of
                              Sister Mary Francis’ great and unusual affection for her mother as of a
                              profound sentiment rarely noticed either in or out of the religious life. It
                              was the sweet soul’s one<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="173" data-tei-n="167"> </a></span> earthly romance.
                              I do not know in what light Mrs. Procter’s memory will go down to posterity
                              when the letters and memoirs of the generation in which she played so large
                              a social part come to be written and published; but this image of her as
                              enshrined in her daughter’s heart should be recorded, for it is true.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1901">Of the gifted eldest daughter the mother was intensely proud, and well may
                              she have been, for a more vital spirit never inhabited a finely‐wrought
                              frame. Adelaide Anne Procter was so curiously unlike her poems, and yet so
                              distinct in individuality, that it is a pity she was not painted by any
                              artist capable of rendering her singular and interesting face. There was
                              something of Dante in the contour of its thin lines, and the colouring was a
                              pale, delicate brown, which harmonized with the darker hair, while the eyes
                              were blue, less intense in hue than those of Shelley; and like his also was
                              the exquisitely fine, fluffy hair, which when ruffled stood out in a halo
                              round the brow. A large oil painting of her exists, done, I believe, by Emma
                              Galiotti, and it is like her as she appeared in a conventional dress and a
                              most lugubrious mood, but the real<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="174" data-tei-n="168"> </a></span> woman
                              was quite different. She had a forecast of the angel in her face and figure,
                              but it was of the Archangel Michael that she made one think. There was
                              something spirited and almost militant in her aspect, if such a word can be
                              applied to one so exquisitely delicate and frail. She was somewhat older
                              than myself, and therefore, while I remember Agnes as a little girl, my
                              first distinct memory of Adelaide dates from a period when she was already
                              grown up, and had returned from Turin.

                           <p id="d45862e1906">In her manner and dress she bore all the marks of a very exquisite breeding.
                              She was conversant with foreign languages, knew French and Italian well, and
                              wrote a peculiarly clear and delicate hand. One of her minor accomplishments
                              was that of illumination. Monsignor Gilbert possessed two excellent examples
                              of her skill in this unusual art. In her youth she danced lightly and well.
                              All these little details go to make up the portrait of a very charming
                              personality.

                              Dickens thus tells the story:—“Happening one day to dine with an old and

                              an early proof of the Christmas number of

                              entitled ‘The Seven Poor Travellers,’ and remarked, as I laid it on the
                              drawing‐room table, that it contained a very pretty poem, written by a
                              certain Miss Berwick. Next day brought me a disclosure that I had so spoken
                              of the poem to the mother of the writer in the writer’s presence; that I had
                              no such correspondent in existence as Miss Berwick, and that the name had
                              been assumed by Barry Cornwall’s daughter, Miss Adelaide Anne Procter.”
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e1931">From this time forward, I forget the year, she continued to write in

                              kingdom; and Miss Procter received a pathetic appeal from a young lady, who
                              asked her 
                              <emph id="d45862e1939">could</emph> it be true that these lovely verses were all
                              hers, for her lover had been in the habit of assuring her, as each poem
                              successively appeared, that it was his own! Twelve editions followed one
                              another, and five years after, the demand for her poems was still “far in
                              excess of that for the writings of any living poet except Mr. Tennyson.” I
                              think it caused her a feeling of shyness amounting to pain to have so far
                              outstripped her poet‐father in popular estimation. “Papa is a poet. I only
                              write verses.”

                           <p id="d45862e1944">A very few years after this wide recognition of her genius the end came. Her
                              health began to fail in 1862, and by the end of that year she was confined
                              to her bed. So great was the fragility of her frame, that when once the
                              lungs were attacked there seemed to be no chance of saving her. Then began a
                              battle which the two or three surviving people who witnessed it can
                              assuredly never forget—a battle royal with the power of Death. I do not mean
                              that she consciously tried to live a longer life, but that she did<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="177" data-tei-n="171"> </a></span> not give way an inch to the Destroyer.
                              The only time I ever saw her quail was one day when I got a little pencil
                              note, “<q id="d45862e1948" style="; ">They say the second lung is attacked</q>.” I hurried
                              off to the house, and found her sitting up in bed, her pretty fair hair
                              standing out in a halo, her blue eyes fastening on mine with an anxious,
                              wistful look. But the momentary panic passed away, and she recovered her
                              cheerfulness, repeated her prayers, talked of Jean Ingelow’s poems (and
                              particularly of the “High Tide in Lincolnshire”), made her gentle jests—she
                              was naturally extremely witty—and faced the Destroyer with the most pathetic
                              mixture of resignation and pluck imaginable.

                              Christmas Eve)—I went to her in the evening, and found her greatly
                              oppressed. But she was very eager about a poem of mine, “Avignon,” and would
                              sit up in bed holding it in her slender, trembling hands, and trying to
                              correct the proof. The last line ran— <q style=" display: block; ">

                              o’clock. It was not possible for me to remain later without greatly alarming
                              my parents, and I had to leave. After an anxious consultation with Edythe, I
                              returned to the sick‐room and kissed her forehead, saying, “Good‐night,
                              dear.” She looked up at me quickly and gravely, and said, “Good‐night.”
                              After I had left, they sat beside her—the mother, the sister, and the maid
                              who had been with them very many years. About two in the morning of the
                              Feast of the Purification her breathing became oppressed. She looked up in
                              her mother’s face, and said, “<q id="d45862e1964" style="; ">Mamma, has it come</q>?” And
                              Mrs. Procter said, “<q id="d45862e1967" style="; ">Yes, my dear</q>,” and took her in her
                              arms. And so, while Edythe knelt by her side, reciting the prayers for the
                              dying, my dear Adelaide passed away in peace.

                           <p id="d45862e1971">It remains to say a few words about her poems. Since for years they had a
                              larger sale than those of any other poet save Tennyson, they must have
                              penetrated into every reading household in Great Britain. Of late, however,
                              their popular fame seems chiefly to repose on the “Lost Chord,” nobly set to
                              music by Sir Arthur Sullivan. It is wonderful to see the enthusiasm infused
                              by this<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="179" data-tei-n="173"> </a></span> song. The vast audience of St.
                              James’s Hall thrills as one man when it is given. But in the beauty of the
                              narrative poems, and in the profound depth of feeling of those which have an
                              autobiographical source, the student of Victorian literature will, I am
                              convinced, find permanent delight; and that many verses and many lines will
                              survive may be inferred from that perfection of form which is essential to
                              lasting fame. Miss Procter always used the plainest words to convey her
                              thought, the simplest, choicest words to express her feeling. Some of those
                              which deal with the human heart are wonderfully sweet and subtle.

                           An ancient village lying in a fold of the hills behind Mont Valerien sends up a
                           faint smoke from its chimneys; the first spurs of the hills of Normandy can be
                           seen, line beyond line, in the far distance, and the great flat plain through
                           which the Seine winds and doubles is dotted with the lights of innumerable
                           villages—the leafy suburbs lying between Paris and St. Germains. Paris itself is
                           unseen, but a walk through the woods brings within range the electric gleam of
                           the summit of the Eiffel Tower shining like a star. To a dweller in the village
                           the exceeding antiquity of every association, covering full a thousand years,
                           affects the imagination with a silent background of past generations. Yet<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="186" data-tei-n="180"> </a></span> over this cluster of dwellings, this house,

                        <p id="d45862e2194">Looking back to the early months of 1870, I can recall no portent, no slightest
                           cloud upon the horizon. Invasion seemed as far from us in France as it seems
                           from us in England now; and France was very prosperous. Commerce made no
                           complaint; the corn and the wine and the oil of that land of many climates were
                           poured forth into the markets as from an abundant cornucopia. Literature was
                           still sending out fresh shoots, and Victor Hugo survived as a magnificent
                           oak‐tree of the past. There were scarcely any beggars to be seen, and the
                           innumerable works of charity were unvexed by opposition. Near our village the
                           Empress had specially favoured the great convalescent hospital at Le Vesinet,
                           and omnibuses rolled constantly to and fro between its gates and those of the
                           Paris hospitals. So far as I could see the huge machines of the State worked
                           smoothly: we had great doctors in the wards and great lawyers at the Bar. Not
                           only was there an Imperial

                           such as a Thiers and a Gambetta, and a great following of respectable and
                           thoughtful men of the professional classes. Parties, however much opposed, were
                           of a firm consistence, and political aspirations were reasonably expressed and
                           definite in shape. The household whose experiences I am about to describe had
                           then been settled in the village for forty years. They had bought houses and a
                           little land, and children had grown to maturity and settled in life. The
                           surviving elders, who had been very young under the First Empire, were not
                           Imperialist, but were personally attached to the House of Orleans; and the men
                           of the next succeeding generation had interests connected with the Second
                           Empire, and one of them, who ten years later occupied a public office of
                           eminence, was a consistent Republican of a moderate type. The growing lads had
                           of course taken their

                           the Tuilleries or Compiègne, and the low thunder of the democratic growl was
                           unheard by one and all. Once, two years before the war, the English member of
                           this family had dined in Paris at the house of an Inspector of Schools who had
                           risen from the ranks, and at this table there arose a whisper of a likely rising
                           among the workmen of Lyons, a whisper nervously hushed, and which was until
                           later forgotten by the hearer. Who remembers the sheet lightning of the previous

                           Emperor, vexed by parliamentary opposition, and aware of smouldering embers in
                           the great towns of which the outer world knew nothing, called a

                           <foreign id="d45862e2235" xml:lang="fre">Splendide</foreign>!” in a tone of the deepest
                           exultation. And from every quarter of France during that week came up similar
                           returns from all the Mairies. I have never doubted the essential veracity of
                           that popular vote, which counted by millions, and which no tampering could have
                           caused to swerve in an appreciable degree.

                        <p id="d45862e2240">It is not true that provincial France distrusted the Empire. Whatever may have
                           been the state of feeling among the workmen of the great towns, no one who
                           really knows the departments of that immense country can imagine that the great
                           wine‐growers in the south, or the farmers of La Beauce, or the fishers of
                           Brittany desired a change of government. France is so very much larger than
                           England, and its farming peasants have so great a stake in the soil, that they
                           form a huge, steady, horizontal mass of workers, up at four in the morning and
                           in bed by nine in the evening, devoted to their children and to the accumulation
                           of five‐franc pieces or

                           of public institutions. These French millions have less to complain of than any
                           other labouring millions in Europe, and in spite of difficulties in
                           manufacturing centres, and in the Parliament sitting in Paris, it is difficult
                           to believe that the shock would in our generation have come from within if it
                           had not previously come from without. Never for twenty years did Napoleon the
                           Third appear to sit more firmly on his throne than in May, 1870.

                           The white fruit blossoms had fallen from the apple and pear trees, the Spanish

                           village crier delivered his usual warning about mad dogs. We knew that the
                           French troops had shot across the frontier on their way to Berlin, and one of
                           the newspapers published a map of the seat of war, which we pinned up, and on
                           which the advance was daily marked in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="192" data-tei-n="186"> </a></span> blue
                           paint. Then came anxious letters from London—“You do not know what is happening.
                           Come back, come back, and bring your belongings.” But it seemed useless to
                           dislodge a very complicated household of old people and young children, and
                           servants who were practically Basques; and so the days passed on, and July was
                           out, and Saturday the 7th of August dawned upon us—the last peaceful day we were
                           to know for many a month.

                        <p id="d45862e2281">This Saturday evening stands out in my memory because of a visit from Paris. A
                           very young man, not yet twenty‐one, the “Premier Prix,” who, as I have said, was
                           thereby exempt from conscription, came out to dinner; and an hour later the
                           heavy shutters were unbarred, and the windows of the drawing‐room thrown open on
                           the balcony. The fading sunset filled the room in the cool of the evening, and a
                           little child lay asleep in a cot while the servants were dining. It was a time
                           of special stillness; but that sun had set on the battle‐field of Wœrth, the
                           first great defeat of the war. MacMahon was wounded, and the sons of many
                           mothers lay dead before their time.
                        </p>

                        <p id="d45862e2287">This news did not reach us till 8 o’clock the next morning, and then it came
                           thirty miles across country 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2289" xml:lang="lat">viâ</foreign> Versailles,
                           although we were much nearer to Paris. It had been brought by the late train
                           overnight to a still lonelier village near Mont l’hèry, by a wealthy gentleman
                           connected with the Paris Bourse, and travelled in an omnibus starting at six
                           o’clock in the morning from Mont l’hèry to our neighbourhood. I doubt if the
                           dread reality appeared in the morning newspapers until twenty‐four hours
                           later.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2293">We knew, then, on the Sunday morning that the tide had turned, and that the
                           Germans were chasing the French. Still, not a soul believed that they would get
                           to Paris, or that the zone of country in which we lay could be in the smallest
                           danger; and for three weeks we remained quietly, trusting absolutely to the
                           great battle which was to be fought between Paris and the frontier. Meanwhile,
                           the young child was baptized in the village church, and the youthful cousin and
                           godfather came in the new uniform of a Garde Mobile. All the men under forty
                           were being enrolled in some volunteer corps.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2296">All through August the Germans seemed to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="194" data-tei-n="188"> </a></span> us to
                           be not so much advancing as concentrating in huge masses between us and the
                           frontier. They were still a hundred miles away, and I cannot now remember what
                           gave the first bad alarm; but one day an order was given to make ready for the
                           blowing up of all the bridges on the Seine outside Paris. This was afterwards
                           said to have been absolutely useless. The Germans were coming from the east, the
                           Seine running from Paris to the sea turns north and west, doubling like a
                           riband, and is so comparatively narrow that it could oppose small hindrance to
                           the passage of troops. But the order was given, and our old stone bridge at
                           Bougival was to be prepared by excavating a huge hole in the central buttress
                           and the filling of the same with powder. This sight for the first time struck
                           terror into the country people; and as we went on the following day down the
                           steep hill, a mile in length, between our house and the river, we found
                           literally every woman in Bougival sitting on her doorstep crying, with her
                           children round her—not only the poorer inhabitants, but the most respectable
                           shop‐keepers and bourgeois were in the street, filled with a prevision of
                           what<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="195" data-tei-n="189"> </a></span> was really coming, for three weeks
                           later every soul was turned out of house and home and Bougival evacuated in four
                           hours. Meantime we watched the men working at the hole in the bridge, the first
                           symbol of the coming ruin.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2303">We now began to feel it unwise for a family containing very old and very young
                           members to remain in an isolated house on the outskirts of a village absolutely
                           without defence, and, strange to say, we made up our minds to move into Paris,
                           and all our neighbours who had apartments in the city did the same; but this was
                           not easily accomplished. Some fresh panic struck the general courage on the 27th
                           of August, and on the 28th, St. Augustine’s Day, and a Sunday, high mass was
                           said as usual at ten o’clock, and in the afternoon everybody who could procure a
                           vehicle got to the railway station of St. Cloud, a distance of five miles, at
                           four o’clock. There the scene was most extraordinary. No luggage could be taken,
                           and the terrified crowd was dressed with the usual precision of the French on
                           Sunday. Nobody showed any panic in their outward attire. Streams of well‐dressed
                           people came to the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="196" data-tei-n="190"> </a></span> station from all sides, the
                           train was hopelessly late, the service disorganized with the strain. The tired
                           children cried, and when at last the train came up, the people were packed in as
                           best could be done, and we steamed away to Paris; our boxes with personal
                           luggage were brought in next day. Everything else had to be left to its fate;
                           that is to say, the house was put into complete order, securely barred and
                           locked, and the keys deposited with the village schoolmaster. We were by this
                           time aware that the dozen dwellings of the gentry would be occupied, if ever the
                           German army approached Paris, but nobody knew anything about the customs of war,
                           or had any notion of havoc being wrought by regular troops. It is amazing now to
                           reflect upon that extreme ignorance. In any case, however, it would have been
                           hopeless to attempt any sort of guard, for every valid man was enrolled in some
                           corps, and the farmers and gardeners and tradespeople of the locality were all
                           too fearful for their own property to pay any attention to ours.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2308">So we went into Paris, to a small apartment near the Luxembourg, where, with a
                           sigh of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="197" data-tei-n="191"> </a></span> relief, we felt ourselves perfectly
                           safe! And an English lady, who was in very weak health, told me that she sat
                           under the trees in the Luxembourg with a Tauchnitz volume of Miss Yonge’s “Daisy
                           Chain”; she felt it soothing to her nerves!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2314">But this delusion did not last many days. A regiment of young mobiles who had
                           been stationed somewhere in the Eastern Departments, were returned upon Paris.
                           They marched through the streets looking thoroughly tired and depressed, and
                           made more impression on their fellow‐citizens than a hundred telegrams from the
                           seat of war. Urgent letters from England implored us to come over without delay,
                           and the French newspapers told us of the victualling of Paris and the closing of
                           the railways. As I look back on that five days, the last we were to see of
                           Imperial Paris, I wish that we had taken one more glance at the Tuilleries—had
                           walked once again round the Hotel de Ville! But every hour was taken up with
                           inexorable family duties, and we had to get away by a line we had never
                           travelled before; for the Northern Railway was no longer available. It was late
                           on the Friday evening when our party of three elders and two<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="198" data-tei-n="192"> </a></span> young children got off from the station of St.
                           Lazare, and as we passed the line of the fortifications, bands of navvies were
                           piling earth upon the road, leaving only the one line of rails on which our
                           train rolled. Their bent heads in the fading sunset was the last we saw of Paris
                           and its people for many a long month. We embarked at Havre for Southampton, and
                           as we passed through a wicket, which must have been put up to check the stream
                           of passengers passing on to the steamer, one of our party vexatiously gave in
                           the dark a ten‐franc piece instead of half a franc to the toll‐man. By this time
                           it was past midnight, and Saturday the 3rd of September. At Southampton we found
                           the German vessels in the harbour dressed out with flags in honour of Sedan!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2319">I will now return to the village and to the silent, dark house where we had left
                           so many treasures. It may perhaps be said, with astonishment, why were they left
                           there, since we had had so long a warning of the Prussian advance? It seems as
                           if we might have filled up the Paris apartments with our household goods.
                           Assuredly, if we had had any conception<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="199" data-tei-n="193"> </a></span> of
                           what war means, we should have done our utmost to get a van, and to place at
                           least the pictures in safety. But while we did not dream of spoliations, and
                           believed that the worst which could happen would be the billeting of German
                           officers in the house, it would, unless we had taken the alarm in the very
                           beginning of August, have been extremely difficult to get the larger pictures
                           conveyed twelve miles into Paris. I was not the actual mistress of the house,
                           and the real and most dear mistress was in acute anxiety for her grandsons,
                           exposed to constant danger; and for the younger children, who might have been
                           caught in some place where they would not be able to get proper food, and, above
                           all, milk. So many children were thus sacrificed in the siege of Paris. Their
                           number will never be known. But what might have been undoubtedly saved were the
                           miniatures and bronzes; and in particular two of the former, which had been
                           given over into my care. Their date was about 1750, and their subjects in full
                           costume. I had pinned them by their faded loops of ribbon to the velvet border
                           of a mirror in the drawing‐room on the day they came from<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="200" data-tei-n="194"> </a></span> an old house in the provinces. It is a sore vexation
                           to me to think that I packed up the silver spoons and forgot these treasured
                           great‐great‐grandparents. Nay, still more astounding was it that during the week
                           we spent in Paris, one of the servants (they were sisters, and extremely
                           intelligent women from the south) went out to the village, walking for many
                           miles; and after assuring herself that all was right and safe within the house,
                           she filled a large clothes basket with our apples and pears, which it vexed her
                           frugal soul (she was the cook) to leave wasting on the trees. She then cast
                           about how to get them into Paris, and thought herself very fortunate to find a
                           washerwoman with a cart. The two women hoisted up the basket, and then jogged
                           back to Paris in a leisurely way!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2326">Of the other houses in the village summary mention can be made. The Chateau, a
                           noble old pile of Louis the 14th’s date, was left with servants, and ultimately
                           used to lodge an Etât Majeur. It was not ill‐treated. A large handsome villa on
                           the summit of the hill was quite spoilt internally. A small house belonging to a
                           relative was occupied, knocked about, but not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="201" data-tei-n="195"> </a></span>
                           destroyed; but the house next to this, where I remember an old lady with a white
                           cat and much handsome Indian china, was entirely gutted. From the floor of the
                           
                           <foreign id="d45862e2330" xml:lang="fre">salon</foreign>, where the great tall Aladdin jars
                           had proudly stood, the visitor looked up to the roof, with a view of the three
                           fireplaces left in the wall one above the other.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2334">I do not know by which route the Germans came into the village, whether by the
                           lower road from Bougival, or by the upper road from Versailles; but the date was
                           the 19th of September, when the gardens are in gorgeous array, and the woods are
                           untouched. I only know that they must have fetched the keys of our house from
                           the schoolmaster, and that they started with good intentions, for the commanding
                           officer caused an inventory to be taken of everything in the house. Sixty
                           soldiers were lodged in it, who must have indeed been in tight quarters. The
                           officer settled into one of the two largest bedrooms; he had the drawing‐room
                           curtains brought upstairs to drape his broad window; he also transferred the
                           drawing‐room clock to his mantelshelf, and to this we owe its preservation. Even
                           the large bell glass<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="202" data-tei-n="196"> </a></span> which protected it was
                           unbroken, when a smaller clock of white marble and ormolu was broken to pieces
                           with a hammer, and the works taken away. To this unknown officer I feel that we
                           owe gratitude for his good intentions, though he was in the sequel quite unable
                           to carry them out, for it seems that the troops were constantly shifted.

                        <p id="d45862e2339">When the German army had been in occupation on our hills for about a month, the
                           sortie of the 13th of October took place. So far as we are able to understand
                           what happened, the French poured out of Paris by way of Rueil and Mont Valerien,
                           and met the Prussians somewhere near Bougival, from which all the inhabitants
                           had been summarily sent away in the course of an afternoon. They were given four
                           hours in which to pack and go. The French seem to have surged up through the
                           steep little town, and to have fought desperately on the broad road below our
                           house. The four nuns who keep our village school stuck gallantly to their
                           dwelling, which they turned into a hospital. They were respectfully treated by
                           the German soldiers, and the good women took in the wounded of both sides. Sœur
                           Marie told me afterwards that 
                           <emph id="d45862e2341">fifteen</emph> legs<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="203" data-tei-n="197"> </a></span> were amputated in one night. In our cemetery is a
                           lonely grave, marked only with the initials and the regimental number of three
                           German soldiers, and with the fatal date, the 13th of October. I believe this
                           was the one occasion on which there was actual desperate fighting in our
                           immediate neighbourhood, though bombs came flying over the village, and one shot
                           by Mont Valerien whizzed over miles of tree‐tops and fell on a small room on the
                           ground floor of the Chateau. The staff officer who sat writing at a bureau threw
                           himself flat upon the floor, and while the window, the mantelshelf, and yards of
                           the wall flew into splinters, he was unhurt.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2347">Week after week went by, the scarlet geraniums died in the garden, the vine
                           leaves became scanty on the wall, the frost of late autumn deepened in
                           intensity, and the troops packed into our house began to suffer from cold. They
                           cut away for firewood the upper part of an outside staircase which was sheltered
                           under the deep eaves of a chalet standing on part of our ground; and then, when
                           they wanted three little attic rooms under the roof, they set up a tree against
                           the wall and climbed up like bears<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="204" data-tei-n="198"> </a></span> at the Zoo.
                           They wrenched an arm off several chairs, as handy to light up the fires, and
                           they piled up such a quantity of wood in the fireplace of the drawing‐room that
                           the 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2351" xml:lang="fre">parquet</foreign> was literally charred in a great
                           semicircle, and it was a miracle that on the day this happened the whole house
                           was not burnt down. Another day they wrenched off a dressing‐room door, and a
                           great piece of the wall came down with it. The village doctor, who remained
                           through the whole time, told us afterwards that jorums of brandy were served out
                           to the men in the worst of the weather. This filled his French medical mind with
                           astonishment, and perhaps accounts for the strange things which occurred. For
                           instance, they tore away one marble jamb of the dining‐room mantel, and with it
                           they appeared to have pounded something on the tiled floor. They burnt the
                           cupboard doors, and they carefully extracted every map of France wherever they
                           found one, particularly from Murray’s Handbook in which were several! But I
                           think that the strangest record of their presence was the condition of a small
                           chandelier brought from Vienna by my dear friend the author of “Gossip<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="205" data-tei-n="199"> </a></span> of the Century.” It was of Bohemian glass, a
                           bowl with pendants, and very prettily coloured. Being of small size, it hung
                           high on a hook in the centre of the ceiling. I found the pendants broken and the
                           bowl intact! What sort of strange popgun had been employed by the idle troops,
                           and what wonderful marksmen they must have been!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2358">That our house was substantially preserved, was owing, I believe, to the presence
                           of Dr. Russell, the correspondent of the 
                           <bibl id="d45862e2360">
                              <title id="d45862e2361">Times</title>
                           </bibl> at the headquarters
                           at Versailles, to whom I wrote begging for his intercession. In spite of the
                           strange ruin which fell upon our interior, not a single mirror was broken, nor
                           were the pictures stolen with one exception. But a magnificent 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2364" xml:lang="fre">portrait en pied</foreign> now in the French Gallery of the
                           Louvre was stabbed five times on the black velvet robe, and another smaller
                           portrait of a venerable ancestress was badly scratched by being wedged against a
                           broken window to keep out the draught. Our fruit trees were not cut down, and a
                           general intention had obtained of 
                           <emph id="d45862e2367">not</emph> gutting us for firewood! The
                           mischief was of a smaller kind, and infinite in detail. For<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="206" data-tei-n="200"> </a></span> instance, a polished bed of walnut wood was scarred
                           with innumerable fine cuts, and on our return we wondered who had ornamented it,
                           till we learned that the officers invariably lay down “booted and spurred.” More
                           intentional, on the part of some idle trooper, was the running of a sharp knife
                           up the kind face of Mrs. Beecher Stowe, on an engraving given by herself. It
                           took the exact middle of the nose in perfect accuracy. As to the books, they
                           were torn in an extraordinary manner. A large volume of biographies of literary
                           ladies of all countries, executed in America and sent over to France by
                           enthusiastic friends, was torn, defaced, and here and there adorned with
                           flourishing moustaches! A similar volume of American “Queens of Society,” of
                           which the frontispiece had been a beautiful engraving of Mrs. Martha Washington,
                           was entirely despoiled. Presentation copies of works by Victor Hugo and Thiers,
                           and a set of Byron given by Mr. Murray, were torn and injured. One precious
                           object, a brown paper first edition of “Hernani,” with Victor Hugo’s autograph
                           respects, did escape. It was found tossing in a cupboard in an attic, saved by
                           its<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="207" data-tei-n="201"> </a></span> shabby look and ancient date. But
                           piles of autograph letters from nearly every writer of eminence in France, and
                           from very many in England, carefully sorted, laid in a secretaire, and put aside
                           by the mistress of the house for a literary grandson, were hopelessly
                           sacrificed. They were found lying about in fragments in the garden, dirtied,
                           torn, and charred. It was decided by those who first returned to the home that
                           none of them could be picked up. They were shovelled aside and burnt.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2375">Of the people who remained valiantly in the village a few strange and painful
                           incidents may be recorded. I have already said that the nuns were well and
                           respectfully treated. One of them having to go to Versailles for food and
                           medicine, told me she had been carefully and politely driven over by a soldier.
                           But when the beloved old curé was turned out of his presbytery and sent off to
                           Versailles by night, some wretched wag tied two of his hens round the old man’s
                           neck! The village doctor remained in his solitary house, and two officers were
                           billeted upon him.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2378">The first of his military inmates cleared off all his cups and saucers, and he
                           laid in a fresh stock;<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="208" data-tei-n="202"> </a></span> two more officers
                           succeeded, and they also packed up and went off with his crockery, which seemed
                           to be an article in much request; the third time he received new inmates he said
                           he had no money, and they had to buy their dishes. When we came back the
                           following June we found that Dr. Lemaire, who had always been a particularly
                           trim, clean‐shaven elderly gentleman, had grown a long white beard. We looked
                           with wonder at this unprofessional adjunct, and he told us that “his officers”
                           had a trick (which sounded like a queer joke) of insisting on his procuring legs
                           of mutton, not only for their own consumption, but for other favoured friends.
                           When he assured them that he could get neither sheep nor special joints, they
                           frowned ferociously, and said, “
                           <emph id="d45862e2382">Take him out and shoot him</emph>.” Six
                           times he was taken out, and respited! “After which,” said he, “I grew my white
                           beard, thinking that it might soften their hearts.” Finally, when peace was
                           made, the two last officers quartered upon him wished him good‐bye with
                           effusion, hoped to see him if he ever travelled so far as Berlin, and solemnly
                           presented their cards “for the ladies of the family” (who were safe at St.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="209" data-tei-n="203"> </a></span> Valery). The old doctor replied, wrathfully,
                           “
                           <foreign id="d45862e2387" xml:lang="fre">Oh! Ç’a non</foreign>.” Which said in a certain
                           manner is very like an expletive!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2391">During the later weeks of the siege a very malignant form of small‐pox became
                           epidemic at St. Germains, three miles off. A village woman caught it, and the
                           Prussians nailed her up in a cottage, and vowed instant vengeance on anybody who
                           should dare to break in. Our good Sœur Marie crept out at night and got soup and
                           medicine through the crevices. The patient recovered; and it is fair to say that
                           the officers had probably a shrewd notion that the nuns would manage the matter
                           somehow in spite of their prohibition. Not so fortunate was the village
                           innkeeper, a man of substance, whose chief customers had been wealthy Parisians
                           coming out to dine on Sundays under the spreading limes in a picturesque
                           courtyard. This well‐known inn was called the 
                           <name id="d45862e2393">Tourne‐Bride</name>. On the
                           first appearance of the Prussians, an officer requisitioned the whole of the
                           cellar. The wine was worth 10,000 francs, £400 of English money. Its loss and
                           the stoppage of the business meant ruin to the unfortunate man. He moved with<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="210" data-tei-n="204"> </a></span> his good wife into a small tavern two miles
                           away, but it broke his heart, and he died at the end of a year.

                        <p id="d45862e2399">Endless were the stories told us by our humbler friends. One woman who took her
                           daughters off to her own family in Normandy, buried all her linen, which she had
                           no means of carrying away, in a great tub. Of course it was discovered and dug
                           up, and the linen was nowhere on her return. But the worst trouble of all
                           happened at Bougival when François Duberg was taken for cutting the telegraph
                           wires, tried by a court‐martial at Beauregard (a Chateau once in royal
                           occupation, and a nursery for the children of France), and shot on a field above
                           our house. He was a gardener by trade, carried no arms, but said, “he would do
                           it again.” At the obelisk raised to his memory on the road, a discourse is every
                           year pronounced in the early days of November. His wife, poor soul, went
                           mad.

                        <p id="d45862e2402">I have now set down after the lapse of five and twenty years the things which I
                           saw and the things which were told me by my neighbours, and they are mostly such
                           as do not pertain to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="211" data-tei-n="205"> </a></span> the great tragedies of
                           war. Of these there were no lack, but I mostly heard of them by letter or read
                           of them in print, and I have as yet strictly confined myself to my immediate
                           oral knowledge. But one young friend of mine, a Breton of a noble family which
                           sent five members to the field, contracted fever in the retreat from Orleans,
                           and got back to his wife and to his old mother, just to die. He left two orphan
                           children. Of our family, a cousin was dragged out dead from a heap at Sedan;
                           both our own young mobiles suffered severely in health, and our “Premier Prix”
                           felt the effect for years. Typhoid fever and lingering ill‐health are apt to
                           strike lads suddenly deprived of proper food and exposed to days and nights of
                           inclement weather. Another friend, a middle‐aged man, sent his young family
                           away, but remained in Paris with an elder daughter who was dying of consumption
                           and could not be moved. He nursed her to the end, and buried her, and sickened

                           Valery knew nothing of what had happened for three weeks, and were in an agony
                           of suspense, receiving no more balloon letters from Paris. At last a<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="212" data-tei-n="206"> </a></span> cautious word reached them in a circuitous way from
                           Belgium, and the wife nearly lost her reason. This unfortunate man was
                           son‐in‐law to our excellent doctor, who, being himself outside Paris in our
                           village, could only write to his daughter and his own old wife that he had “no
                           news.”

                        <p id="d45862e2410">Finally, of the very worst side of war a much younger medical man who afterwards
                           succeeded Dr. Lemaire spoke to me with shuddering horror. He had been employed
                           in an ambulance corps on the frontier, and at forty was an ageing grey‐haired
                           man. He published a volume of reminiscences which for ghastliness is
                           unsurpassed, for he possessed literary talent, in addition to medical skill. He
                           said to me, 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2412" xml:lang="fre">apropos</foreign> of his book, “Of course I
                           would go through it again if necessary; but I look back on those weeks not only
                           with unimaginable horror, but with unutterable disgust.”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2416">And this I believe was the real impression left by the Franco‐German war. France
                           
                           <emph id="d45862e2418">certainly</emph> did not want it; and though Prince Bismark did want
                           if, and planned how best to prick on an excitable people, it is impossible to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="213" data-tei-n="207"> </a></span> believe that the Germans wanted it. There
                           were practically no wrongs to revenge; or whatever wrongs had formerly been done
                           could be laid on the shoulders of that great Captain who cost us all so much
                           blood and treasure that even the son of Queen Louise of Prussia was not
                           justified in avenging them on peasants and shopkeepers sixty years after. War
                           between two highly‐civilized nations is not only cruel, but profoundly shocking,
                           and yet ever since the world’s literature began, there has existed a conspiracy
                           of silence in favour of recording only the heroic aspects of war; but the
                           reports of the English newspaper correspondents and the publication of even one
                           book such as Doctor Pierre Boyer’s, have brought the truth nearer to the
                           apprehension of general readers. A well‐dressed, intelligent woman whom I met in
                           a railway carriage, and who seemed to be engaged in some successful commerce,
                           said to me, with an expression of extreme disgust, 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2423" xml:lang="fre">apropos</foreign> of the war, “

                           people did fight to the bitter end, and would do it again, but it would be with
                           a reluctant anger difficult to describe. It would be unnatural<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="214" data-tei-n="208"> </a></span> to expect that the Services, whose advancement and
                           reputation depend on getting some one to fight with them, should share this
                           feeling; but it is true of the vast masses of provincial French people, busy on
                           their own concerns, prosperous in affairs, doting on their children,
                           scrupulously particular in their dress, in their cooking, and in the conduct of
                           all their ceremonies, marriages, baptisms, and funerals—people who are extremely
                           civilized, from Boulogne in the north to Nice in the south, and who have no love
                           either for the anarchist or the long‐haired Bohemian—these comfortable millions,
                           though they will fight like lions when their blood is up, certainly feel that
                           the bloodshed, the dirt and destruction, and the many abominable incidents of

                           <hi id="d45862e2445">IT</hi> is more than thirty years since I first saw the great Cardinal. He
                           was then at the head of the oblates of St. Charles Borromeo, and apt to be
                           called in the outer world “Dr. Manning of Bayswater.” He seemed to fill the
                           populous suburb with his greatness. Somebody, I forget whom, who saw that I was
                           tending to the Church, urged me to go and see him, and I remember feeling a
                           strong disinclination to go. I had never spoken to any human being, priest or
                           pastor, on spiritual things; but an appointment was made, and I went, and was
                           shown into a small, narrow room, where I waited a few minutes, and then the
                           tall, thin, severe‐looking priest came in. He was not severe in later years,
                           and, to one who knew him well and loved him much, it is not quite easy to
                           accurately record that first impression. He<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="216" data-tei-n="210"> </a></span>
                           was perfectly polite, but I thought that he disliked speaking to a woman who had
                           taken an active part in a public movement. This may have been a morbid
                           impression on my part, but it caused me to be frightened. I was not long in the
                           room, but though he spoke with the most measured chilly calmness, the few things
                           he said made a deep and lasting effect on me. He told me that “by the mercy of
                           God” he had never doubted of His Personality. He spoke as if perfectly conscious
                           of the Comtist influence then taking possession of English society. It was just
                           at the time when George Henry Lewes and George Eliot were beginning to reign
                           supreme. If one so peculiarly impersonal as Dr. Manning could stoop to a
                           personal revelation, the words and the accent he used may be held to have
                           conveyed this meaning: “Though I am well aware of the length to which the
                           controversy has been carried, still I have never had to concern myself with it.
                           Doubt never touched me in that direction. I have always had an entire faith in a
                           Personal God.”

                        <p id="d45862e2451">He then spoke, with a curious divining sympathy, yet not in any way
                           sympathetically, of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="217" data-tei-n="211"> </a></span> the manner of torments to

                        <p id="d45862e2456">He said that the wearing of the round Roman collar in the street had been a
                           misery to him; and he told me of having said to Hope Scott as they walked away
                           from the church where I think they had both been received simultaneously,
                           “
                           <emph id="d45862e2458">Now</emph> my career is ended.” And he added, looking at me
                           impressively, “But where I once worked on an acre I now work on a square
                           mile.”

                        <p id="d45862e2462">He knew that I had worked hard, and he had some secret wish to console and
                           encourage in a possible loss of influence, though his manner was that of a man
                           of marble.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2466">He then advised me to read up the history of the Reformation on all sides, for he
                           put down several books on a sheet of paper, and among them D’Aubigné, remarking,
                           calmly, “But it is full of lies.” In this interview Dr. Manning gave me no
                           spiritual advice, made no appeal to me. His look seemed to say, “You are an
                           unpleasant young woman, one of the stiff old Presbyterian stock; but I will tell
                           you faithfully what I think, and let it take its chance.” I do not think he<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="218" data-tei-n="212"> </a></span> had any suspicion that I was so impressed and
                           overpowered by his intellect, that when I left the room and the house I ran
                           nearly all the way home, with the sense that I was fleeing from an overmastering
                           brain, and that I dreaded it.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2471">I did not see him again till he was Archbishop of Westminster and I a married
                           woman with a young child, whom I took to him for his blessing one day when I had
                           to call upon him about the subscriptions got up for poorer French exiles in
                           1870‐71. How good and kind he was about it, writing a letter which I took to
                           Lady Lothian. Since then I have always loved him with a full comprehension of
                           the absolute fitness of the choice of Rome; a fitness which everyone was finally
                           compelled to acknowledge before he died. Other priests and bishops have been
                           good, holy, of old English birth, and assimilated to the type of the Vatican,
                           but it was Henry Edward, Cardinal Archbishop, who was then wanted for England,
                           and he seemed by his whole experience and training to be the appointed man.

                        <p id="d45862e2474">Sunday, June 8th, 1890, was his silver Jubilee. He preached in the little
                           Catholic church of St. Edward, Palace Street, Westminster, standing<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="219" data-tei-n="213"> </a></span> for three‐quarters of an hour by the altar rail; his
                           text: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” After a very few doctrinal words,
                           he fell back on the personal example of Jesus Christ our Lord, talking very
                           simply and plainly to his congregation, saying he had no doubt they were “good,”
                           but were they 
                           <emph id="d45862e2478">good</emph>? A word not to be forgotten. To his Jubilee he
                           made no allusion whatever; but he did say that he had remembered on the previous
                           day that in this church he had said his first mass, or rather in the poor room
                           which then did duty for a church in that parish. And his first pastoral work had
                           also been in that most poor parish, now totally changed by the building of
                           Victoria Street. He said he had worked with the good Sisters of St. Vincent,
                           some of whom he noticed among the audience this day.

                        <p id="d45862e2482">In his scarlet robes, and with his fine worn face, he was much less terrible than
                           “Dr. Manning of Bayswater” in the black dress of the oblates. I do not think
                           anybody ran away from him in his closing years.

                           of the English world was represented, he bore himself with upright dignity, but
                           his tall figure seemed so frail, and its movement so noiseless, that he might
                           have been taken for a visitant from another world than ours. He took his place
                           on the red

                           absent in Ireland, he spoke of his own great age, and as being conscious that he
                           would soon be called away; and instantly from every corner of the vast room rose
                           an interrupting murmur of men’s and women’s voices, of which the sense was an
                           entreating “No, no!” It was a spontaneous and unconventional cry, which no
                           hearer could forget, and for nineteen months longer it prevailed. On the 14th of
                           January, 1892, the old man who had nobly done his work, and the young man on
                           whom so many hopes were set, passed away almost in the same hour.

                           and in the slight speech to which allusion has been made, he spoke of times when
                           he had felt<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="221" data-tei-n="215"> </a></span> it his duty to withstand some
                           current of thought popular among his own people, adding, in a tone of intense
                           feeling, “
                           <emph id="d45862e2497">And I bore the reproach</emph>.” These words would make a
                           wonderful epitaph for his tomb, for they were like all his utterances,
                           emphatically true. Probably none of the English converts to Roman Catholicism
                           had suffered from interior causes more deeply than he. It used to be said of him
                           that he was an ambitious man, and in the sense in which Pitt and Fox, Gladstone
                           and Beaconsfield, have been ambitious, it was no doubt true. He had taken a

                           should he 
                           <emph id="d45862e2500">not</emph> have been ambitious, when he might have been the
                           Becket or the Wolsey of the Church of England? Our country offers great prizes
                           to her worthy sons, and Henry Edward Manning might have been anything he chose.
                           But in 1851 he obeyed the call of conscience, resigned his place and his work,
                           and for fourteen years lived literally in obscurity, like any other ordinary
                           ecclesiastic. As a childless widower, his life had for many years been a lonely
                           one. When he took Catholic orders I believe that a female relative<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="222" data-tei-n="216"> </a></span> of an older generation kept his house in South Audley
                           Street; and when he went to be head of the Oblates in Bayswater, his position,
                           though important and dignified, was not more so than that of a hundred others.
                           In the ten years during which England passed through the Crimean War and Indian
                           Mutiny, and when the French Alliance was a prominent political factor, Dr.
                           Manning’s name was literally unheard in the outer world. He had lost himself,
                           and his place knew him no more, so far as his Protestant fellow‐countrymen were
                           concerned; and when, in 1865, he was made Archbishop of Westminster, a post in
                           which Dr. Wiseman’s genial kindness and literary gifts had greatly succeeded in
                           disarming prejudice, the appointment was greeted with a deep murmur of
                           dissatisfaction, of which perhaps the most reasonable element was the feeling
                           that the honour was due to one of those old English families who had held to
                           their faith through centuries of difficulty. And the new Archbishop was known to
                           be far from conciliating. He had the severity of a Wesley; he turned the ladies
                           out of the choirs; he put down florid church music; he detested<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="223" data-tei-n="217"> </a></span> theatres, round dances, and the drinking of wine;
                           and, above all, he never tried to soften dogma. A Frenchman might have said of
                           him, “Qu’il etait plus Royaliste que le Roi.” When a young lady had the audacity
                           to tell him, “But, your Eminence, I 
                           <emph id="d45862e2508">like</emph> going to balls,” his
                           characteristic answer was, “
                           <emph id="d45862e2511">Better not, my child</emph>.” His whole
                           leaning was towards counsels of perfection, and he died when he did because he
                           absolutely refused to take stimulants lest his tempted children should thereby
                           feel themselves ever so slightly loosened from their pledge; and for these and
                           other most unpopular causes he “bore the reproach” with a certain pathetic
                           severity. And little by little, year by year, the ascetic old man, who went
                           about on ordinary occasions like “a shabby curate,” won upon his own
                           recalcitrant people, and upon the outer English world. They came to understand
                           his point of view, which was that if a man saw a good thing he was to strive
                           after it utterly regardless of human respect; and if he saw a bad thing he was
                           to fling himself against it; and if it was clear about a text of Scripture it
                           was to be obeyed in all its length and breadth. His<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="224" data-tei-n="218"> </a></span> natural fastidiousness never stopped him for an
                           instant. To the repentant woman he simply said, “Go and sin no more”; the
                           drunken man he took literally into Archbishop’s House, and set him on his feet
                           again.

                        <p id="d45862e2518">Also, in the later years of his life, when all opposition had faded away in the
                           respect and affection gained by his great qualities, the Cardinal himself
                           softened. In nothing was this more evident than in his widened sympathy with
                           other men and their partial conceptions of Christian faith; but it was a
                           sympathy born of perfect security that none could misunderstand him. When it was
                           a question of the submerged millions, he went down into the arena, and the
                           delicate, fastidious Dr. Manning of former times seemed infused with white light
                           and heat of Christian love.

                        <p id="d45862e2521">I will conclude by a few extracts from a letter written by a witness of the
                           funeral service at the Oratory, who was stationed in the organ loft of the
                           immense church. It begins by an allusion to the lying in state, when the people
                           stood waiting in the streets in a 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2523" xml:lang="fre">queue</foreign> half a

                        <p id="d45862e2527">“Ah! how I wish you had seen the Cardinal<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="225" data-tei-n="219"> </a></span> lying
                           in death. There was no pomp of any sort, though the size of the great square
                           rooms draped with black cloth gave a certain external majesty to the scene. He
                           lay on a sloping bier clothed in dark purple, and surrounded by tall green palms
                           and wax lights, severe in beauty, and suggesting one of the older monuments in
                           our Abbey, and his delicate, worn face and calm repose majestic as the bronze
                           image of Margaret of Richmond.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2532">“And at the Oratory on Thursday the only pomp was the great array of white‐robed
                           priests of his diocese, each with a lighted taper. Every man represented a world
                           of work. And there also were gathered representatives of every rank, of every
                           profession, of all the services. But what most moved me were the long minutes
                           when I stood by the temporary porch on the pavement and saw the coffin carried
                           out, and the pall slipped from the polished mahogany as it was placed in the
                           small, low hearse, while the bishops and the clergy stood in a circle with bowed
                           heads. There ensued a long halt in the street, amidst the silent crowd; and it
                           seemed an especially fitting farewell to one who had peculiarly been<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="226" data-tei-n="220"> </a></span> the people’s priest. It was the last of Henry Edward,
                           one of our four greatest, Gladstone, Tennyson, and the Queen the other corners
                           of the great English Square; but the Cardinal and the Queen are morally first.
                           He stood out as a landmark or a lighthouse in the troubled sea of public life,
                           and on the day of his burial, all over the world, wherever live the
                           English‐speaking peoples, from Melbourne to San Francisco, from New York to
                           India, went up the prayers of his fellow‐Catholics following the course of the
                           sun. And all the way to the cemetery the three miles of road was lined by the
                           English working‐men; they came by the hundred thousand to see that little low
                           hearse pass by, just as by the hundred thousand they had come to see him lying
                           dead. I have been tempted to destroy this letter lest you should think it of
                           intemperate warmth, not thinking as he thought. But impressions of the hour are
                           worth preserving, and what I have sought to convey is this: The man who so died
                           and so was buried was no emissary of an alien power, no head of an ‘Italian
                           Mission.’ He was peculiarly English—nay, even insular—in the severity of his
                           piety, and every man within or<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="227" data-tei-n="221"> </a></span> without the
                           Oratory Church was almost without exception English. Into the very marrow of the
                           social politics of his time had the English Cardinal penetrated, striving to
                           bring into them the will and words of that only Saviour in whom he believed. And
                           not until Queen Victoria is gathered to her fathers shall we see such an emotion
                           of the popular heart again.”

                           <hi id="d45862e2548">THE</hi> first time I saw Mrs. Booth was at a meeting held to consider the
                           best methods for ameliorating the state of the poor in London. It was held at
                           Mr. Edwards Clifford’s studio in Wigmore Street, over Benham’s shop. The rooms
                           were large, and were filled by an extraordinary number of representative people
                           of all ranks. On the walls were portraits of ultra‐refined faces of thoughtful,
                           high‐bred women; many will know what type I mean by referring to Ary Scheffer’s
                           well‐known portrait of Mrs. Robert Holland. They have ever since mingled
                           inextricably, though in strange contrast, with my memory of Mrs. Booth, whose
                           personal presence was that of Paul.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2552">I remember the sincere, measured paper read by Miss Maude Stanley, and the
                           declamation of an officer from Portsmouth, and a horrible<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="229" data-tei-n="223"> </a></span> recital of Russian atrocities given by Lord Radstock.
                           I cannot now remember in what way they were connected in his mind with the
                           condition of the London poor, but all the more ardent Christians approached the
                           question from the standpoint of conversion.

                        <p id="d45862e2557">Then from a seat lying a little way back to the left, and facing a formidable
                           array of countesses, of whom there were said to be six sitting near the one to
                           the other, rose a small, pale, quietly‐dressed woman—Mrs. Booth, the wife of a
                           dissenting minister, and comparatively unknown. In later years she made quite
                           another impression upon me, but she was then about five and forty, dressed, so
                           far as I remember, in no particular costume, and she was so closely surrounded
                           by tall, handsomely‐dressed women that her physical being seemed to sink into
                           insignificance, only her face shining out with a sort of luminous pallor. Nor
                           was her speech outwardly more impressive than her appearance. She had no graces
                           of acting, no remarkable choice of words; the high‐bred faces of the portraits
                           on the walls seemed to ask, “Who is this daughter of the people, whose face is
                           square and simple, whose<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="230" data-tei-n="224"> </a></span> dress is that of the
                           most modest middle class, who has evidently never even in the most refined way
                           sought for the applause of man?”
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2562">But Mrs. Booth 
                           <emph id="d45862e2564">spoke</emph>, and with her first few words all possibility
                           of comparison fled from my mind. The poor of London rose up, a piteous, accusing
                           crowd, in those charming rooms; their unutterable sufferings quivered in her
                           voice, and the ardent love with which she regarded the human creatures for whom
                           Christ died shone in her eyes. She told story after story of the back courts and
                           the gutters, of the drunkard snatched from the feet of the kicking horses, of
                           the widow, the orphan child, the convict, the lost women in the street. At this
                           distance of time I can remember very little detail, but when the meeting broke
                           up I made my way through the benches and sat down by her side, and she talked to
                           me of her own children, who as they grew up turned one by one definitely to the
                           Lord and His work.

                        <p id="d45862e2569">I suppose I must have told her that I had young children of my own, for our
                           conversation was wholly on these lines. I remember the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="231" data-tei-n="225"> </a></span> lovely expression of face with which she spoke of her
                           two eldest born.

                        <p id="d45862e2574">Years passed before I again saw Mrs. Booth. The Salvation Army had become
                           organized, active, and famous, and I felt a curiosity to see one of the meetings
                           advertised at the door of the hall close to Regent Circus. It was full noon as
                           we went in, and the light shone down on Mrs. Booth standing in the centre of the
                           gallery or estrade from which she spoke. Two or three of her young daughters
                           were with her, and a knot of other workers in the costume since become so
                           familiar in the streets of London. The meeting must have been nearly. over, for
                           I do not remember any word of Mrs. Booth’s, and one of the sweet‐faced children
                           led off a hymn. At the conclusion I walked up to the estrade, and said, “Do you
                           remember us? I am so glad to see you again. We are Catholics.” It was an older
                           and, as it seemed to me, a much more assured and vigorous face which smiled down
                           a welcome on mother and child. “Ah!” she said,“ 
                           <emph id="d45862e2576">that</emph> makes no
                           difference,” and I felt a sort of enveloping kindness and sympathy shining in
                           her eyes. And that was the open secret of the woman who<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="232" data-tei-n="226"> </a></span> was borne to the grave a few years later amid such an
                           outburst of universal sympathy as has perhaps never been paid to one of her sex
                           before. She had a good and broad intelligence, judging complicated questions
                           with common sense, and was a mental power in the great organization which has
                           struck so deep a root among the working classes. But that which gave her
                           predominant influence was a higher thing, a spiritual quality which inspired her
                           judgment and drew hearts by the hundred and the thousand. It survived on that
                           painful death‐bed of more than thirty months’ duration, and thrilled in the
                           messages she sent to her husband’s people. It can only be defined as the power
                           of the saint.

                        <p id="d45862e2582">On two other occasions I witnessed Mrs. Booth’s extraordinary influence. The
                           first was that of the funeral service at Olympia. She had died, of long wasting
                           malady heroically borne, at Clacton‐on‐Sea, and on Monday, the 13th of October,
                           1890, at eight o’clock in the evening, the coffin was borne from one end to the
                           other of the immense building, into which 36,000 people had crowded, after which
                           it was necessary to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="233" data-tei-n="227"> </a></span> close the gates and shut
                           out thousands more. After his wife’s coffin, the General walked alone, followed
                           by his children. It was placed on a raised platform in the gallery, behind which
                           a friend and I were seated, so that the vast audience lay far below us, and the
                           mourning group a little to the right. No single voice could have penetrated the
                           great space of Olympia, and to meet this difficulty a special litany had been
                           prepared, printed, and distributed among the congregation, and large lettered
                           signals were hoisted at intervals on the platform, instructing the audience to
                           rise and sing or to pray. The service began with the old Wesleyan hymn,— <q style=" display: block; ">

                              </q> Such a volume of sound can seldom have been heard by human ears. But most
                           touching was the moment when the children of Mrs. Booth, rising above the
                           coffin, sang the hymn which had comforted her when dying. One voice rang sweet
                           and even triumphant above the rest. I was told it was that of the beloved
                           eldest<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="234" data-tei-n="228"> </a></span> daughter, Catherine Booth, who,
                           after many journeys to her mother’s bedside, was not with her at the last. The
                           scene was indeed indescribably affecting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2604">And on the following day the traffic of central London was stopped for two hours
                           in the busiest part of the twenty‐four, while “the Army Mother” was carried past
                           the Bank and the Royal Exchange. I can only speak for the subdued reverence of
                           the crowd in that great triangle opposite the Mansion House, but the incident
                           which impressed me most concerned the omnibuses. Long after the cabs and
                           carriages had disappeared from the streets, the Bayswater omnibuses made their
                           way slowly across to one of the railways. But there came a moment when they also
                           were stopped. For that last hour every one of these vehicles carried a black
                           flag, rising above the head of the driver.

                        <p id="d45862e2607">In turning over the two volumes of Mrs. Booth’s life, the reader’s eye is
                           arrested by the mute witness of the photographs. The first, of “Catherine
                           Mumford” at the age of twenty‐three, was taken shortly before her marriage. It
                           shows us a thoughtful and intelligent girl, with<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="235" data-tei-n="229"> </a></span> curls smoothed away from a very broad forehead; the eyes are steady and
                           lambent, and the dress is not only careful but in the fashion of the time. She
                           wears a brooch, a buckle, and a little lace. The costume is simple and modest,
                           but by no means that of a young lady indifferent to her appearance. I compare
                           this portrait with the face of the living woman whom I met about twenty‐five
                           years later, and the change was very great. She was then the anxious, devoted
                           mother of many children, and the Salvation Army was already being organized;
                           moreover, she had been sorely tried by illness in her family, and other
                           anxieties, spoken of freely in the Life, had pressed upon her. I remember how
                           frail she looked in 1878, and how everything in the least mundane had dropped
                           away from her dress and manner; how entirely she looked the minister’s wife. But
                           in the early eighties the tide had again turned, and the sweet, matronly
                           countenance of “the Army Mother” under the Salvation Army bonnet, was as
                           reposeful but far more animated than that of the young Catherine Mumford with
                           the curls. Her smile dwelt like sunshine on those whom she addressed. One felt
                           that<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="236" data-tei-n="230"> </a></span> she must be a lovely mother at home.
                           And there is one more faithful photographic record of that wonderful face, “Mrs.
                           Booth in her last illness.” Once more the softly curling hair is brushed back
                           from the broad forehead, over which sixty years have passed, and a full half
                           century of thought and prayer; and strange to say, though the expression is
                           deeply marked by suffering, it has regained something of youth. The beautiful
                           large eyes are undimmed, and in the intentness of their gaze and the patient
                           stillness of the attitude can be read a touch of final obedience, which goes to
                           the depths of the beholder’s heart. She who did all things well had gathered up
                           her feeble strength to leave a peaceful, comforting last impression on her
                           children near and far.

                        <p id="d45862e2614">It was on a Saturday, the last day of Self‐Denial Week, and “the sun was sinking
                           in an almost cloudless sky,” when death released Mrs. Booth from the sick bed on
                           which she had lain for more than two years. But as her death was the very text
                           on which her life was written, the Army Mother survives in a very full and
                           peculiar sense. Whatever may be the future of the Salvation Army, on whatever
                           lines it may develop when<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="237" data-tei-n="231"> </a></span> the General and his

                           Booth must remain as permanent in the history of our race.

                           <hi id="d45862e2629">SOME</hi> years ago I wrote and put away certain paragraphs dealing with the
                           knotty question of what constitutes literary decency. A comparison was attempted
                           between the differing standards of Shakespeare, of Zola in his earlier works,
                           and of Ibsen in his dramas, which had then only lately reached the British
                           public. Shakespeare’s plays invariably appeal to the morality which had been
                           taught in Stratford‐on‐Avon for a thousand years. Truth and honour, chastity and
                           its reverse, have retained in his pages their ancient significance; and his
                           women move across the richly‐varied stage not as victims, but as standard
                           bearers—the great majority are high‐minded and virtuous, and if they fall they
                           and their male accomplices are invariably brought to punishment.

                           the two, Zola adheres in substance much the more closely to the old canons of
                           right and wrong. In the powerful story of “Thérèse Raquin” the connection
                           between adultery and murder is wrought out with awful precision; and in his
                           other books this great author is driven to paint the truth of things, not
                           merely, as is often said, by coarse epithets describing coarse subjects, but by
                           some intellectual necessity of hunting an evil thing to the bitter end. Once
                           started on the track of a sin or a sinner, Zola seems compelled by the law of
                           his own genius to finally kill them out of the way. Whether the process be
                           intentional or no (a difficult question to decide), Zola and his characters get
                           hopelessly entangled in the laws Of the universe, and thus it is that his novels
                           so closely reflect human life on its seamy side, and are a mine of interest to
                           the mature intellect.

                           It is radically impossible to write a long complex description of human lives
                           without knocking up against the granite walls and the inexorable laws which
                           environ mankind; all novels and plays which attempt to disregard them end by

                           his own corridor, laying down a law of mine and thine which, in spite of its

                           long to read, a guerilla warfare is found easier to handle than an attack by

                           published a year ago, portrays the hero as breaking his mother’s stiff yet
                           fragile heart, and quickly putting his too conscientious father out of pain. His
                           poetical education is finished by teachers whom we are forced to refrain from
                           describing. And yet the reader cannot afford to laugh, for when the glaring

                           and to ask ourselves how the historic morality of Christendom, so inseparable
                           from our conception of the older European world, could have been accepted if it
                           be not true? If anyone say it was enforced by the preached doctrine of judgment,
                           we are driven to ask how that doctrine of unerring retribution came to be
                           accepted. We must regard it as appealing to the inner sense of the human heart,
                           and fall back upon the saying of Prospero in<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="243" data-tei-n="237"> </a></span>

                           man “cannot abide” the snake and the alligator, nor the roar of the hungry
                           lions, even when caged. All kinds of decomposition are abhorrent, witness the
                           old expression to “scent danger.” Consider the inner meaning of the word
                           “intolerable,” and the old notion of hair standing on end with horror, and the
                           wide‐world superstition of the evil eye. Consider what we mean by nerves, and
                           how, although we know some of their functions, we know nothing of their hourly
                           influence in hatred or in love. As we suffer a deadly fear of that which has not
                           yet come to pass, so have we never reached to the root of that which we cannot
                           abide.

                           positive injunctions of Scripture as regards public and private morals. These
                           injunctions lie at the base of our public law, they have been hitherto on the

                           that the Power which made the human race also makes for righteousness. We don’t
                           know why, but on the whole we do know how. Though the Catechism, except by
                           authoritative assertion, does not help us on this particular point, and the
                           Creed implies a foregone conclusion, the fact is witnessed by the almost
                           consentaneous agreement of thinkers, and by the familiar proverbs of every
                           nation, as one of the deep, undeniable things of God. To say the Contrary is to
                           say an insane thing, and the man or woman who persists on saying insane things
                           will finally do insane deeds: and their last end is nought. If we seek health we
                           are forced to fall back in the last resort upon the morals of the Gospel, not
                           only because they fit the complicated wards of the human lock, but because after
                           a violent recrudescence of low art and low literature, we touch the brink of
                           that sphere which Shakespeare’s Prospero declares “A good<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="247" data-tei-n="241"> </a></span> nature cannot abide to be with.” The human torch
                           turns blue deprived of vital moral air. In the presence of the power of darkness
                           the human creature surely dies.

                           the front if any mortal ever did; for the name of his garden was Strawberry
                           Hill; and though the voices of most of his contemporaries sound dully in our
                           ears, his is clear enough. So oppressed was he by reason of the gout, and so
                           little did he realize his own proportions, that he actually says, in September,
                           1765, that “When one has a singular turn of mind, and not

                           tired when he wrote that sentence, for it is awkwardly expressed and lacks his
                           usual ease. He goes on to say that his mind has taken in its quantum of
                           feelings, and that he shall live upon the stock and be doubtless very insipid to
                           himself and others. So<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="249" data-tei-n="243"> </a></span> far, however, was this

                           was kept green, and prolonged deep into the reign of Queen Victoria. I once had
                           a book, in two volumes, which I gave to a learned and much gifted friend—it was

                           True. But every ten miles of that far‐gone time was as a hundred now. It took
                           him longer to get to Arlington Street than it would now to travel from Brighton;
                           and the astonishing liveliness of his intellect was really preserved under
                           difficulties which were little less than what one encounters here, fifty miles
                           away, for he had no newspapers to speak of, and was so crippled with his gout or
                           his rheumatism, that he doubts whether he dare sit in the damp by the River
                           Thames, close to which he had made this “nest for his old age.” He doesn’t know

                           lugubriously. A rose by any other name will smell as sweet. Do not therefore
                           trouble whether your bones are stiffened by gout or rheumatism, but sit in your
                           garden in as sunny a spot as you can find, and endeavour to keep well to the

                           a century: she had been painted by Opie; she had lost her husband in the year
                           previous to the battle of Waterloo, and he and she had been intimate friends of
                           Louis Philippe while yet he was Duc d’Orleans. When she grew so old that she
                           could no longer drive out to see her neighbours, it is recorded in the village

                           she yet did not like to fall behind the times; and ordering from London the
                           newest and most fashionable bonnets suited to an aged lady, wore them seated in

                        <p id="d45862e2811">Perhaps the person who in our modern world lived most to the front through a long
                           life and up to its very end was the lady who was so aptly described by Lord
                           Houghton as a “Poet’s Wife, a Poet’s Mother, herself of many poets the
                           counsellor and friend.” Mrs. Procter’s inexhaustible vitality was a wonder to
                           behold. To a certain extent this was true of her mother, Mrs. Basil Montagu,
                           Carlyle’s “Beautiful Lady.” But the latter was dressed like a picture of
                           splendid stately old age, and recalled a generation alive in 1800; while it
                           seemed as if Mrs. Procter could not grow old. There came a time at last when
                           many of the old 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2813" xml:lang="fre">habitués</foreign> were dead or
                           invalided, and then her drawing‐room was bright with eager, fashionable
                           Americans. If another decade had brought Chinese society to our very doors, the
                           most travelled mandarins would have found their way to that charming room in the
                           Albert Mansions. She would have found appropriate words wherewith to condole
                           with the New Zealander upon the ruins of London Bridge. She was mentally quite
                           devoid of prejudice, nothing in her ever fossilized. The broad principles upon
                           which<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="252" data-tei-n="246"> </a></span> her life was based are such as
                           resist the impact of years. Her religion, very silent, never seemed to take on
                           any fashion; and her heart retained its few passions uneffaced by time, or loss,
                           or death. When Carlyle’s posthumous words attacked disrespectfully the household
                           of her stepfather, Basil Montagu, in which she had been brought up, Mrs. Procter
                           sprang to her filial revenge with the alertness of a young Sioux. She said to me
                           with angry scorn, “It is dangerous to war with a dead hand.” And the London
                           world, which had read the attack with silent pain, found itself confronted with
                           Carlyle’s own letters of sixty years ago.

                        <p id="d45862e2819">Of singular vitality was also the intellect of the younger of our two great
                           Cardinals, though more than eighty years had passed over his head. If anyone in
                           the world could be reasonably expected to entrench himself in the ascertained
                           doctrines and secular custom of the Church, it would be a man of strictly
                           clerical training, once a high dignitary of the Church of England, and then for
                           five‐and‐twenty years a still greater dignitary of the Church of Rome. Added to

                           it was who caught every breath of social change, whether it were for evil or for
                           good. He was awake to every fever of the popular pulse. I once heard him in the
                           Pro‐Cathedral give a sermon about the reading of bad books, which was enough to
                           make the readers and hearers shake in their shoes. Be sure that he knew every
                           current of the modern book trade. And so of the sufferings of humanity. Few
                           there are who really understand the sting of poverty, the anguish of the
                           downward plunge, the misery which causes suicide in Paris and in London. But
                           Cardinal Manning did understand these things, and looked at the state of our
                           working classes as Ruskin also looked, though with a far deeper sense of the
                           spiritual loss.

                           with all the luxuries and refinements of his father’s rank in life, was the last
                           person to have ever realized by experience what it is to want a meal or, as
                           happened lately to a poor woman in Paris, to

                           owe their solid place in the affections of the nation, when so many other royal
                           houses have gone down. And the popular sympathy has not been won by concession.
                           No one of the Queen’s children has tucked under his arm the umbrella of the
                           Citizen King. No princess has been sent to Girton, nor any prince to a school
                           equivalent in social degree to a French

                           The all‐aliveness is deeper than that, and they owe it not merely to the keen,
                           refined intellect of their father, but much more to the essential sympathy of
                           their mother’s heart; which whoever reads intelligently will find rippling
                           through her letters, her journals, and even through the quaint telegrams which
                           she sends flying through her private wire. When a certain popular
                           sold‐by‐the‐million‐for‐a‐penny periodical calls her Majesty “our own Good
                           Gracious One,” the extreme vulgarity of the expression may be pardoned for its
                           wonderful aptness. The slight<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="255" data-tei-n="249"> </a></span> damage done to
                           “trade” in the first years of the Queen’s sombre widowhood may well be pardoned
                           for the sake of her perpetual expression, couched in vigorous and extremely
                           individual language, of that touch of nature which makes the whole world kin.
                           There are passages in the “Highland Journals,” and notes to the “Life of the
                           Prince Consort,” which will remain firmly embedded in the rich literature of the
                           Victorian Era, and which, if picked up in a bottle on the sea shore in any part
                           of the dominion, would cause a finder of critical faculty to exclaim “Bless me!
                           This must have been written by the Queen!” I remember, in particular, the
                           account of the telegram telling of the death of the Prince Imperial; and the
                           picture of the carriage accident in Scotland; and sundry notes in which her
                           Majesty explains that in her very early girlhood she had preferred to keep her
                           young lover dangling. Elizabeth “swore roundly”: her dear and honourable
                           successor does not swear, but her voice hits straight out and says exactly what
                           she means to say. More than ever in the modern world if you speak at all you
                           must speak plainly, and to<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="256" data-tei-n="250"> </a></span> a certain extent it
                           must be what people are willing to hear. When Macaulay obtained a Peerage and a
                           fantastic sum for his “History of England,” it was because for one hundred and
                           seventy years the English nation had been educated to Whiggery. Even the Toryism
                           of the day had turned Whig in the persons of Sir Robert Peel and Gladstone.

                        <p id="d45862e2842">But with Beaconsfield the tide turned to Tory Democracy, or rather it should be
                           said that he himself caught the turn of the tide—caught it instinctively, not
                           because he was a courtier, but because he was a poet. Can anyone doubt that the
                           man who wrote “Lothair” would have now been for Federation, and have so written
                           and spoken as to make it a self‐evident return to the enchanting and revered
                           Heptarchy? He never would have fossilized had he lived to be a hundred years
                           old.

                        <p id="d45862e2846">It does not suffice that persons should be intellectual, popular, entertaining,
                           to ensure their being to the front. Browning, for instance, was less in touch
                           with his time than Mrs. Procter, and probably less than Lord Tennyson, who
                           seemed to catch instinctively the echo of popular<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="257" data-tei-n="251"> </a></span> feelings and reflect them in his song. George Eliot
                           certainly lived an intellectually present life; and had she not unfortunately
                           been alienated from the religious thought of her day, she would probably have
                           reflected more than any other writer the collective thought of England. But she
                           had persuaded herself that the problem of historic Christianity was practically
                           extinct. I think that her mind altered slowly on this point, and that had her
                           life been prolonged she would have come to endorse at least the remarkable
                           summing up of John Stuart Mill.

                           comes to London, and sells his cat to the King of Morocco. But the real poor of
                           the slums; or the lowest women, or the convicts at<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="259" data-tei-n="253"> </a></span> Portland. They are dumb; more dumb than the dog that

                           Their language is a very veil. They hide themselves in slang. Fifty years ago
                           Harrison Ainsworth wrote a book called “Jack Sheppard.” And a certain little
                           schoolboy caught up a song from its comparatively harmless pages—for, after all,
                           it was the fancy portrait of a criminal by a man of letters. I can see the
                           nursery fire and the tea table, and the bread and butter spread with fine brown
                           sugar, and hear the little impish voice singing gaily, “In the box of a
                           ‘stone‐jug’ I was born.” The little gentleman had not the remotest conception of
                           the reality of which he was singing, any more than his great‐nephew, fifty years
                           later, can have of the choice expression, “blooming blazes.” Have we ever really
                           taken it into our minds that the lowest class of all our fellow‐creatures have a
                           language of their own—a detritus, not a new growth? It needs a genius to divine
                           and translate it. Count Leo Tolstoi has managed to do it. Whatever be the

                           described it as to make his readers shudder at the picture, and wonder why in

                           to be accustomed in Bethnal Green. Siberia and slavery, the convict prison and

                           mend the slums. Being a noble, and a man of great worth and reputation, he
                           persuaded the authorities to help him. And for his pains he got cheated and
                           worried, and the gigantic mass of human misery loomed up before him as big as
                           ever. The pages read like extracts from the diary of Lord Shaftesbury or Mr.

                           neighbourhood. So the Palace does real good to ten thousand people out of a
                           rough total of three millions, who are either deplorably poor or on the
                           immediate verge of becoming so.

                        <p id="d45862e2885">Tolstoi also confesses that he was inwardly conscious of his own benevolent
                           kindness, and regarded himself with modest approval as a benefactor of the poor.
                           Till, one day, seeing that he made no real way, he suffered a spiritual
                           revolution. It was borne in upon him that it was useless to try and help others,
                           because he was himself a thief! Well, yes, a thief, who had spent his life in
                           thieving. His coat and his cloak—to take the biblical expressions—and his silver
                           cigar‐case, and the nicely bound books in his library, and the horse he rode, to
                           say nothing of the lands his father had left him, had all been made by the
                           labour of other people, and, however complicated had been the process of
                           stealing, stolen they were.

                        <p id="d45862e2889">At the first presentation this idea is almost unthinkable. It is so alien to all
                           one’s notions of the relation between capital and labour, so destructive of the
                           sacred principle of saving, of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="262" data-tei-n="256"> </a></span> thrift, so
                           absolutely condemned by the first quarter of an hour’s walk in Oxford Street,
                           that the mind refuses to grasp it. After sleeping upon it for a fortnight
                           certain considerations emerge as follows as intended by Tolstoi.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e2894">A man can scarcely make to grow by the actual work of his hands more than he
                           requires for his own sustenance and that of his family. And a woman can scarcely
                           do more in a day than the necessary cooking, washing, and sewing required for
                           the family. If either of them can save a surplus with which to buy somebody
                           else’s labour, it must at first be a tiny surplus; but if by superior cleverness
                           this surplus is made to roll up, it becomes little by little an engine of dire
                           oppression, and ought to be put down by law. It is already forbidden to use your
                           mechanical knowledge in certain directions. You may not race steam carriages
                           through the Strand. You may certainly not invent a machine with claws capable of
                           carrying off all the cats in the country. If, unhappily, you are a giant, even
                           though you were Gog and Magog, it is doubtful whether you would be allowed to
                           contract for the exclusive sweeping of the City streets. Neither, says<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="263" data-tei-n="257"> </a></span> Tolstoi, ought you to construct that monster,
                           a baby capital—the Frankenstein creation of modern days. When it is in swaddling
                           clothes it will be only equal to opening a small shop, but as it fattens and
                           fattens it will grow big enough to start a store, and presently, when it is
                           quite a grown‐up young capital, it will build a mill, and will buy up an army of
                           workers, whom it will enslave almost as if they were blacks, and make them work
                           for it, and at last, like the starling, they “can’t get out.” But mind well, its
                           endings are but the natural growth of its beginnings. You must not save your
                           first shilling with any view to personal aggrandisement. Saved capital is like
                           the imp in the “Lay of the Last Minstrel”—as soon as it can get a voice it will
                           be heard by the attentive ear to be shrieking “Lost, lost, lost!” It is not the
                           offspring of honest labour—it is a devil which has taken its place.

                        <p id="d45862e2899">I have tried to disentangle from Count Tolstoi’s wonderfully eloquent pages the
                           thoughts which logically underlie them. St. Paul will help you to make your own
                           boots, and St. Matthew will forbid you to keep your own coat if anybody wants
                           it. Holy poverty, or, at least,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="264" data-tei-n="258"> </a></span> the holding of
                           riches as though you had them not, has been a counsel of Christianity from the
                           very first. But the extremely intricate mechanism of modern industrial life, and
                           the problem of the middlemen and the sweater, require definite thought, if they
                           are touched at all. And the fundamental idea of Tolstoi is that the very first
                           accumulations of capital are wrong.

                           the risk of creating frightful evils, what can we do with it? The old proverb
                           that money breeds money is the text of all the books upon self‐help. Two
                           shillings are certain to make twenty‐five pence. That little surplus produced by
                           a day’s work overtime, or because my head is better than yours (or 
                           <foreign id="d45862e2917" xml:lang="lat">vice versâ</foreign>), is like a stick which will grow
                           thicker and longer till it quadruples the power of the hand which holds it. And
                           it will not remain quadruple; it will increase manifold till, in the hand of a
                           Napoleon, it becomes an engine capable of hunting a million men to their
                           destruction. Consider the pins—how they are made and what is their profit. Look
                           at a steel “J” pen, and remember that this little thing accumulated one of the

                           are in the midst of immense forces which it would require a far more powerful
                           brain than mine, or than, I think, Count Tolstoi’s to define. But the thinkers
                           have begun to analyze them, and the artists in merely following Ruskin have
                           begun to paint their doings, and the thoughtful working man is crying out that
                           they are devouring him and his brothers, and that their misdeeds must no longer
                           be.

                        <p id="d45862e2923">Of practical politics in this matter there seem to me to be but two. Some would
                           throw the responsibility of the use of capital upon the State, and some have had
                           faith in a sporadic movement, born of the popular conscience, and directed by a
                           more educated popular thought. It is very difficult to see how the State could
                           become an immense bureau, without frightful dangers occurring from any blow to
                           the central power. In spite of the endless speculations of the Socialists of the
                           type of Louis Blanc, it is plainly Fourier who will win the day. I cannot
                           conceive the method by which all the complicated processes of victualling and
                           clothing London could be organized by a central committee, and London is only
                           one of many cities.<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="267" data-tei-n="261"> </a></span> Let anyone ascend the dome

                           million units, and I think that State Socialism will be felt to be an
                           intellectual dream. In the army and navy results are obtained by strict
                           coercion—the welfare of the individual is quite a secondary matter. In the
                           French navy two deserters were, not long ago, chained down in the hold; a
                           punishment from which men never recover. A serious State Socialism would require
                           its police and its prisons to control its deserters, and its successes would
                           demand a co‐ordination of parts in which no joint or screw or rivet could go
                           wrong.

                           conscience; and this it is which is really growing, springing up every day in

                           a doctrine regaining its place in England after centuries of disuse. In the

                           deliberately laid aside; the dower of the nun is absorbed in the common fund. In

                           married couples with children, not one has retained any portion of their private
                           property; they are sustained by a common fund, which often runs low and causes
                           privations of a severe kind.

                           clothe his men‐at‐arms. He dined with his servants who sat below the salt; he
                           had his chaplain and his leech; and up to past middle life he was generally
                           bullied by his nurse. In all the old romances and plays a decent baron behaved

                           Who sprinkles precious stones among the crowd, or wears a rapier with a jewelled
                           hilt? The aristocrat is still made to pay for the handle to his name, but his
                           habits are not really more luxurious than those of the rich middle class. The
                           heaping up of wealth on to the person of man is a thing of the past; and if an
                           example of female dress is required, look at the effigy of Queen Elizabeth in
                           the armoury of the Tower—the long robe in which she sits her horse is literally
                           embroidered with pearls, while our present Queen wears no jewels, save such as
                           are affairs of State, and would no more powder her petticoats with jewels than
                           any other lady of her dominions. Neither does the greatest gourmand in
                           Christendom now spend upon meat and drink as did the pagan emperors of Rome.

                           four roads meet—a lonely country road where the phantoms of fourteen mail
                           coaches drive by in the light of the moon, but where swift bicycles and
                           wandering pedlars now constitute the principal traffic—and when I have dropped
                           into that slit a folded paper with one, or three, or perchance five small
                           pennies mystically attached thereto, the paper flies to Teheran or Yokohama, to

                           attained by Captain Cook. It is an astounding thing, to which we have become
                           only used by daily repetition, and within the memory of living man. The feat has
                           been so changed in conditions that for ease and rapidity it partakes of

                           familiar one—of the victualling of Paris. Such a combination as that of the
                           Bouillons Duval has never been seen since the world began. Duval was the largest
                           butcher in Paris; probably one of the largest butchers in the world. And in
                           1867,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="274" data-tei-n="268"> </a></span> at the time of the Great Exhibition,
                           which was the last occasion on which France shone forth in all the glory of the
                           Second Empire, Duval imagined and carried out the giving of dinners to the
                           hungry public, not, indeed, for a penny, but for about a shilling of English
                           money; a dinner of several courses, with some of the delicacies of each season.
                           A little plate of meat, a little plate of vegetables, carefully cooked, a tiny
                           bottle of wine, a custard, or cream, and fruit. All this can be got out of the
                           shilling. If you are fiercely hungry you 
                           <emph id="d45862e2977">might</emph> make away with two
                           shillings at the Bouillon Duval, The waitresses are neat, respectable women, and
                           these restaurants are in all parts of Paris. Whole vineyards are employed for
                           the supply of their wine. In the matter of little cream cheeses alone,
                           wagon‐loads must be brought up by rail. I once went into a fisherman’s cottage
                           at St. Valery‐sur‐Somme, and saw a room where the fresh shrimps of the morning’s
                           catch lay two feet thick all over the floor. Such a reservoir would be needed
                           for shrimp day at the Bouillon Duval. And it goes without saying that the habit
                           of these dinners has so completely taken<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="275" data-tei-n="269"> </a></span>

                           undoubtedly a genius in his way. The simplicity of his conception has only been
                           equalled by its success. The food has always been in the meadow, the garden, and
                           the sea; the hungry mouths have always been there to eat it. Duval contrived to
                           bring the two together in delicately balanced, ever varying proportions, and
                           there can be no reason why, in the near future, every town in Europe, nay, every
                           village in Europe, should not possess adaptations of the Bouillon which bears
                           his name.

                              allied to the highest qualities of mind and heart. Two such people, a man
                              and a woman, are still vividly remembered with respect and affection by
                              their younger contemporaries. They were unrelated, but lived in the same
                              village; they were substantially of the same generation, and died within a
                              year of each other. The man was Comte Adolphe de Circourt, the woman
                              Mademoiselle Adelaide de Montgolfier. I will try to draw their portraits as
                              best I can.

                           <p id="d45862e3008">The Comte de Circourt belonged to a noble family of Lorraine; his ancestors
                              were not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="277" data-tei-n="271"> </a></span> wealthy, they possessed neither
                              chateau nor fortified manor, but their lineage went back to the Crusades.
                              His parents were betrothed so long ago as 1792, but the marriage project was
                              broken by the Revolution; the bride’s father and mother were imprisoned, and
                              the bridegroom was engaged in the Royalist army, serving under his relative,
                              General de Viomesnil. The young people did not even meet for many years, but
                              in quieter times the engagement was renewed, and their marriage took place
                              somewhere about 1800. Adolphe de Circourt, their eldest child, was born on
                              the 22nd of September, 1801. The married pair were both literary in their
                              tastes, the father read with delight Bernardin de Saint Pierre and Jean
                              Jacques Rousseau; his wife belonged to one of the old patrician families of
                              Besançon, and was allied to parliamentary circles and the 
                              <foreign id="d45862e3012" xml:lang="fre">noblesse de la robe</foreign>. Her education was both
                              serious and learned, she had artistic faculty and painted well. Thus Adolphe
                              de Circourt and his younger brothers received their earliest education from
                              their own father and mother, who had been left by the Revolution poorer in
                              worldly goods than if they had been<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="278" data-tei-n="272"> </a></span> small
                              shop‐keepers. The garden of their little cottage was laid out in fruits,
                              vegetables, and a few flowers; it also contained a small chapel where mass
                              was privately said before the family and certain select neighbours. Adolphe
                              was baptized in this chapel by a proscribed priest, for the parish churches
                              closed by the Revolution were not yet reopened, and there were penalties for
                              celebrating the rites of religion. Their nearest neighbour was an Irish
                              gentleman, a Chevalier de Saint‐Louis, and the son of an officer who had
                              fought at Culloden. The first work of art beheld by the little de Circourts
                              was an excellent pastel of Charles Edward, whose pale face appeared to their
                              infant eyes to be that of a hero and a saint! Adolphe de Circourt was a very
                              precocious child. He read with avidity before he was four years old. A
                              priest was called in to teach him Latin, but the child soon knew as much as
                              the priest, and he went on devouring books, and translated a German grammar
                              into Latin at eight years old. As all the little brothers would necessarily
                              have to provide for themselves in the future, the family moved into Besançon
                              in search of<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="279" data-tei-n="273"> </a></span> education. Their maternal
                              grandmother, Madame de Sauvagney, lived in that town, but they had not for
                              long the comfort of her society; she died within three years, shortly after
                              the death of her son‐in‐law, and her daughter soon followed her to the
                              grave, leaving the five little boys doubly orphaned. Adolphe was then only
                              eleven years old. They had however an uncle, M. Mareschal de Sauvagney, a
                              former parliamentary councillor, and he proved a good guardian to his
                              sister’s sons.

                           <p id="d45862e3020">Two of the orphans died in childhood; of the remaining three, Arthur was sent
                              to Saint Cyr, Albert went into the navy, and Adolphe was destined to a legal
                              and administrative career in Paris. He was warmly received by his relative,
                              become Marshal de Viomesnil. The Royalist party were in the ascendant, and
                              young de Circourt, a brilliant scholar and the most correct of men, managed
                              to live on an annual income of fifty pounds, until his appointment in 1822
                              to a post in the Ministry of the Interior, where his salary was £60 a year.
                              In five years he had risen to be

                              Revolution of 1830 fell heavily on the brothers, who belonged by every
                              association to the service of the older Bourbon. Poor as they were, Adolphe
                              and Albert resigned their posts; Arthur remained in his regiment. Thus,
                              scanty as are the salaries allotted to the civil servants of France, Comte
                              Adolphe de Circourt found himself in 1830 obliged by his political
                              conscience to renounce his own; and it must have seemed for the moment as if
                              there were no future open for the gifted young man. But in that very same
                              year a great good came to him.

                              a remarkable paper upon Russian literature and literary men. This had

                              taken prisoner. Adolphe de Circourt used his influence in the French Foreign
                              Office to obtain some certain news, and his brother Albert, who was then
                              afloat on the Mediterranean, tried to discover the missing man on the
                              Turkish littoral. At last a letter from the surviving brother came to assure
                              them that the young man was really dead; but the vain search had naturally
                              endeared Adolphe de Circourt to Madame de Klustine, and in 1830 she made no
                              objection to her daughter giving herself and her modest fortune to the
                              almost penniless young Frenchman. In the following year the mother was
                              recalled to Russia by important affairs, and M. de Circourt took his wife to
                              Besançon to make the acquaintance of his relations, where she got on
                              excellently with the guardian uncle and the two aunts. For some years the
                              wedded pair travelled in Italy, Switzerland, and France—they did not fix
                              definitely in Paris till 1837. Then began for them a most interesting life.

                              nationalities; though her husband at first would hardly believe that people
                              would mount to an apartment on a third story, to visit people who were not
                              particularly rich, and were attached to no public office; but he had soon to
                              own that he was mistaken.

                           <p id="d45862e3045">Under the reign of Louis Philippe the court circle was not socially
                              influential. The rigid piety of Queen Amélie, the strict domestic life led
                              at the Tuileries and at St. Cloud, the death of the Duke of Orleans, and the
                              anxiety felt by the King for his other sons on dangerous service in Africa,
                              and also the recurrent political difficulties of the reign, left a freer
                              field for private social ambition than might otherwise have been possible.
                              The de Circourts lived in the Rue do Saussayes, and the Comtesse appears to
                              have received her friends every day from four to six, and also on Tuesday
                              evenings. She was a most brilliant mistress of a

                              She was always kind and helpful to distinguished foreigners in Paris, and
                              she took much trouble to help young and unknown talent. For many years after

                           <p id="d45862e3063">In the “Life of M. de Circourt,” a series of interesting letters from the
                              historian Sismondi to the Comtesse are given at length. They show Sismondi
                              in a very human light; and of special interest is the one dated 30th
                              September, 1838, in which he laments the death of Madame de Broglie, the
                              daughter of Madame de Staël. He says that during her lifetime he had been
                              chilled by the intense pietistic atmosphere in which she dwelt, and into
                              which he could not follow her; but no sooner was she dead than he felt how
                              much he loved her, how deep was his respect for her virtues, and how great
                              his appreciation of her talents. In politics Sismondi had been a most
                              hopeful philosopher up to the year 1832. It is melancholy to note in his
                              latter letters how keenly he felt, as years went on, the small result of the
                              liberal principles, from which he had hoped so much.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e3066">Sismondi, who had married an English wife (the sister of Lady Mackintosh and
                              Mrs. Wedgewood), was a moderate Liberal of the most thoughtful type. It was
                              well for him that he<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="284" data-tei-n="278"> </a></span> did not live to see
                              1848 and the reaction. He died, in 1842, of a lingering illness of which the
                              chief suffering consisted in a growing inability to take nourishment. He
                              compared himself to Count Ugolino, repeating a verse from Dante’s “Inferno,”
                              “Galandi con Sismondi et con Lanfranchi,”’ and adding, “Am I then condemned
                              to die by the same torture as Ugolino, in expiation, after the lapse of five
                              centuries, of the crime of an ancestor?” But these pathetic words, wrung
                              from him by suffering, are in no way the reflection of his honourable,
                              useful, and far from unhappy life.

                           <p id="d45862e3071">In 1848, Adolphe de Circourt was sent by Lamartine as ambassador to Berlin,
                              and the chapter of his experiences is of much political interest. He became
                              a personal friend of Frederick William the Fourth of Prussia, who took
                              delight in his society. In leaving Berlin, he refused every diplomatic
                              distinction, but three years later the king sent de Circourt his own
                              portrait painted on porcelain, executed at the famous royal manufactory, and
                              wrote an autograph letter assuring his friend that he need not scruple to
                              accept the gift, as it had cost him (the king) nothing but the frame.

                           <p id="d45862e3076">More interesting, however, to the student of history, is the chapter relating
                              to the Comte de Chambord, of whom de Circourt saw much at Frohsdorf. The
                              Parisian’s wide reading and philosophic habit of mind caused him to have no
                              faith in revolutions, or in unproved political theories of any kind. Not
                              merely because he had inherited Legitimist principles, but because France
                              had been created, moulded, and made great by the secular influences of the
                              old monarchy, did Adolphe de Circourt hold to his king. His point of view
                              was very peculiar and very interesting. As in religion he had always
                              remained a sincere Catholic, of a thoughtful and liberal type, so in
                              politics he was a convinced Royalist in theory, but perfectly capable of
                              analyzing the character of a monarch. One is tempted to say, in reading his
                              reports of conversations with Henri Cinq, that both the men were too
                              reasonable to be able to descend efficiently into the sphere of modern
                              politics. De Circourt gives the impression that Henri held to the White Flag
                              not from romantic obstinacy, but from a reasoned conviction that any attempt
                              to reinstate him on the throne of his ancestors would fail, unless the main
                              principles<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="286" data-tei-n="280"> </a></span> of historic right were
                              genuinely conceded by France. He did not wish to be a second “Citizen King,”
                              and saw no practical good in the renewing of an experiment which had already
                              signally failed; yet it cannot be denied that by reason of his secluded
                              position at Frohsdorf, he was less aware than was the Comte de Circourt of
                              the immense changes which modern science and industrial development had
                              brought to pass among the nations of Europe. For good or for evil the old
                              habits of mind had passed away, and were replaced by new conceptions of
                              human life. None knew this better than the guest who came from Paris to
                              offer his homage to an exiled king. Of the two high‐minded women whose lives
                              were so closely associated with that of the Comte de Chambord, his Italian
                              wife and his aunt, Madame d’Angoulême, Dauphine of France, and daughter of
                              Marie Antoinette, a life‐like description is given, and they undoubtedly
                              exercised a permanent influence on the situation.

                           <p id="d45862e3081">During the first twelve years of the Second Empire, Madame de Circourt
                              continued to receive her friends as usual. In 1856, the year of the Congress
                              of Paris, her rooms were filled<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="287" data-tei-n="281"> </a></span> with
                              foreign diplomats, although a sad accident had already rendered her an
                              invalid. On a summer evening she had sent her servants away to enjoy
                              themselves at one of the fairs so popular in France, and in sealing a letter
                              the lace strings of her cap caught fire; she was severely burnt on the left
                              side of her neck and shoulders, and the result was a state of suffering
                              which lasted for some eight years, and finally caused her death in 1863; but
                              although chiefly recumbent, she never ceased to entertain her friends. She
                              was only fifty‐three when the end came, and her loss made a sad difference
                              to her husband; he gave up his apartment in Paris, and his only home
                              remained the charming house in its large garden called “Les Bruyères” at La
                              Celle Saint Cloud. It was there that for many years I had the honour of well
                              knowing the Comte Adolphe de Circourt, and of listening to that astonishing
                              conversation which no words of mine can adequately describe.

                              the history, lineage, morals, and manners of Prester John. Another time we
                              expressed ignorance of some of the most intimate details of the Reformation
                              in England; on both questions our remark was like the turning on of a golden
                              tap. Some allusion being one day made to Marie Antoinette, M. de Circourt
                              suddenly said, “Do you know why the royal carriage was late in starting for
                              Varennes?” Needless to say that no one present knew why that fatal hour had
                              been lost. He then explained, with the utmost detail, that while the
                              carriage was being packed in the courtyard of the Tuileries, the governess
                              of the royal children, Madame de Toursel, descending the stairs with her
                              young charges, found Louis the Sixteenth painfully exercised in mind as to
                              where she should sit in the great roomy carriage. It was impossible to
                              provide for the usual etiquette, which was so completely a law in the French
                              court that the delay of nearly an hour took place before the matter could be
                              settled. To hear M. de Circourt’s description of the scene, one would have
                              thought he had been on duty<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="289" data-tei-n="283"> </a></span> that night in

                           <p id="d45862e3103">The universality of his knowledge was only to be matched by that of his
                              worldly relations. He was as intimate at the Deanery of Westminster as in
                              Legitimist 
                              <foreign id="d45862e3105" xml:lang="fre">chateaux</foreign>. He knew the best
                              people in every capital in Europe, and was as familiar with Protestants as
                              with Catholics in Germany, England, Austria, and Italy. His little
                              drawing‐room at Les Bruyères was always completely dressed in white, and in
                              summer the fireplace and mantel‐shelf were masses of green‐growing ivy
                              trained in pots and rising to the ceiling, while on the walls were a few
                              very choice portraits and mementoes of the most remarkable people in Europe,
                              among them several exquisite bronze medallions by David d’Angers. It was the
                              prettiest room imaginable, and marked in every detail by an exquisite
                              refinement of taste. The Comte de Circourt possessed a very delicate and

                              an old man the habit of standing during the most solemn parts of the mass,

                              attitude was one of profound reverence. It is so that I like best to
                              remember him. He was stricken for death while walking upon the road which
                              crests the hill of La Celle Saint Cloud, and in sight of one of the most
                              beautiful views in the world, looking across the valley of the Seine towards
                              the hills of Normandy. He was found lying alone and unconscious, his hat and
                              stick fallen by his side: whatever were his last thoughts, they were
                              assuredly good and peaceful, as had been his whole life. He was buried in
                              the little cemetery of La Celle Saint Cloud, by the side of his wife; and
                              Madame de Klustine, who had attained a very great age, was within a few days
                              laid within a neighbouring grave, having been spared all knowledge that he
                              who had been to her as a dutiful son for fifty years, had passed away before
                              herself. There are few men of this century of whom it can more truly be
                              said, that in all which he renounced, and in all which he fulfilled, he
                              thoroughly exemplified the meaning of the old proverb “

                              except a paragraph in a great dictionary, recording her few books by their
                              titles, and giving a wrong date of her birth; not an unimportant matter, as
                              will be seen in the story of her life. She was the only person whom I ever
                              heard speak of the French Revolution as an eye‐witness of the smallest fact.
                              This aged lady, who was the closest friend of our family, was born in 1789,
                              and lived to be ninety. She was therefore four years old at the death of
                              Marie Antoinette; but as she lived not in Paris but at Annonay, near Lyons,
                              that which she remembered distinctly was being awakened by men with torches
                              in the middle of the night; men who came searching under her little bed for
                              a hunted priest.

                           <p id="d45862e3129">The Montgolfiers were very wealthy, important people, who were known to
                              protect the clergy, and their various houses were the scene of frequent
                              domiciliary visits from the revolutionary authorities.

                           <p id="d45862e3132">Nearly two hundred years ago President Montgolfier was a large paper‐maker in
                              Annonay. He received that title as being at the head of some great
                              commercial corporation having its chief centre at Lyons. He had nine
                              children, and lived in patriarchal fashion among his workpeople, and
                              surrounded by relatives. They were all important members of that Tiers Étât
                              of which so little is known in England, and which on its upper level was
                              allied to the 
                              <foreign id="d45862e3134" xml:lang="fre">noblesse de la robe</foreign>. Two of
                              President Montgolfier’s sons became famous as joint inventors of the
                              balloon. Their names were Joseph and Etienne, and the latter was the father
                              of Adelaide de Montgolfier. Joseph was the eldest of the two, and must from
                              the first have had a lively mind, for at the age of thirteen he ran away
                              from the College de Tournon, setting out gallantly for the shores of the
                              Mediterranean, intending to live upon shell‐fish. Hunger compelled him<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="293" data-tei-n="287"> </a></span> to stop on the way at a farm in Bas
                              Languedoc, where he was employed to pick mulberry‐leaves for the rearing of
                              silk‐worms. There his distracted parents found him and sent him back to
                              school.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e3141">Joseph’s intellectual passion was for calculation and the higher mathematics,
                              and a strong thread of eccentricity ran through his nature. Arrived at
                              manhood he went off to a sort of hermitage, where he lived by fishing, and
                              devoted himself to chemistry.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e3144">He made with his own hands Prussian blue and many salts needed in
                              manufactures, and peddled them in the Vivarais. At length his wealthy father
                              got him back, and set him to his natural work in the paper 
                              <foreign id="d45862e3146" xml:lang="fre">fabrique</foreign>; but he never ceased making
                              experiments and getting into divers schemes and much hot water. Meanwhile
                              his brother Etienne, five years younger, was trained as an architect, and,
                              according to the family tradition, fell upon a translation of one of Dr.
                              Priestley’s works on air; on which he rushed to his wife, saying, “If what
                              this Englishman says is true respecting the relative density and weight of
                              warm and of cold air, we can raise a light machine<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="294" data-tei-n="288"> </a></span> above the earth.” The two brothers then laid
                              their scientific heads together, probably much troubling the respectable
                              President, and made the splendid invention of which the last word is as yet
                              far from being said.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p id="d45862e3152">After a first successful trial at Annonay, Etienne, though so much the
                              youngest, was sent on a mission to Paris, where the idea was eagerly caught
                              up by the scientific world, then in full activity previous to the
                              Revolution, and he was invited to send off a balloon from the gardens of
                              Versailles in the presence of the king and queen, and “all the court
                              beside.” The experiment proved a splendid success, and the brothers were
                              offered a patent of nobility, which they refused, unless it were first
                              conferred upon the old President, their father. In 1832, Mademoiselle de
                              Montgolfier and Madame Swanton‐Belloc spent a first summer at La Celle St.
                              Cloud, and saw an old woman living in the village who well remembered the
                              fall of that balloon in a neighbouring wood. Some of these particulars are
                              to be found in an article written by Mademoiselle de Montgolfier for the

                           <p id="d45862e3161">Etienne de Montgolfier did not live to be old. He married a Mademoiselle
                              Brun, who in her early youth had been by some family intrigue made to take
                              the veil. At the age of eighteen she appealed to Rome, and Rome set her
                              free. She became the Madame de Montgolfier who survived her husband so many
                              years that she became legendary in Paris. In the forties a quite fantastic
                              story was set about of a workman finding a very old lady in the street, who
                              said she had forgotten her own name, on which the workman said politely, “<q id="d45862e3163" style="; ">Ah, then you must be Madame de Montgolfier</q>,” and
                              straightway took her to her home! She was popularly said to have died at the
                              age of one hundred and twelve, but she really was in all probability a
                              century old, and there is no genuine record of her having failed in mind.
                              She died in 1845, and is buried in our family grave at La Celle. Her husband
                              predeceased her nearly half a century. He was deeply and fatally affected by
                              the tragic events of the French Revolution. He only himself escaped death by
                              the devotion of his workpeople, who hid him in a moment of extreme danger.
                              But his daughter told me that what really shook<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="296" data-tei-n="290"> </a></span> his health was the death of his dear friend
                              Malesherbes, the defender of Louis the Sixteenth, which took place under
                              peculiarly horrible circumstances. The son‐in‐law of Malesherbes, the
                              President de Rosambo, imprisoned with him, had been taken away from his side
                              for execution a few days before, and Malesherbes himself on the 22nd of
                              April, 1794, was placed in the same cart as his daughter, Madame de Rosambo,
                              and his granddaughter, Madame de Chateaubriand, and her husband. These had
                              entreated to be allowed to share the same prison as the old man, and their
                              wish had been granted. The young people were first guillotined, then Mme. de
                              Rosambo, and lastly Malesherbes himself. The horror of that day, falling on
                              the vivid, sensitive nature of Etienne de Montgolfier, was never recovered,
                              though he survived for five years. His heart became affected, and he went in
                              1799 to Lyons with his family in search of medical advice. Feeling the
                              approach of death, and “wishing to save his wife and children the sight of
                              his death‐bed,” he started to return alone to Annonay, but did not reach his
                              home alive. He died upon the way, at Serrières,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="297" data-tei-n="291"> </a></span> on the 2nd of August, 1799, when his little
                              daughter was only ten years old. She survived him for eighty‐one years. No
                              stronger proof of hereditary faculty can be cited than the case of Mlle. de
                              Montgolfier. She was so good an artist, so good a writer, and so intelligent
                              an organizer of daily life, that she might have excelled in any special
                              department of activity to which she had devoted herself. At eighty years of
                              age she was still at her easel, still wielding a lively pen, and still
                              practically keeping a very complicated household. She was tiny in person,
                              with a face full of expression, and her most marked characteristic was an
                              extraordinary sensibility, using the word in its highest and best sense. She
                              seemed a human harp on which every influence of nature, and every joy and
                              grief of others played in turn. Her musical faculty had been keen, she wrote
                              poems and set them to music. Her “Melodies du Printemps” were well known in
                              France, and are delicate flowers of fancy. When nearly ninety she was fond
                              of playing one particular air upon the piano; it was a Belgian Carillon, and
                              the touch of her frail fingers seemed to the hearers to produce a
                              wonderful<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="298" data-tei-n="292"> </a></span> effect of melodies in the
                              upper air, shaken down from high towers upon the children of men.

                           <p id="d45862e3173">Mlle. de Montgolfier was liberal in politics. She reminded one of the
                              pre‐revolutionary thinkers who finally sealed with their blood their
                              devotion to the rights of man; and she scorned to allow the crimes of the
                              ultra party to make her unjust.

                              Gallican, or perhaps a liberal Jansenist.

                              where she had lived for forty years; although it was on the south side of
                              Paris and exposed to Prussian bombs sent from<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="299" data-tei-n="293"> </a></span> the hills in possession of the enemy. It was not

                              Every other family in the large dwelling‐house shut their apartments and
                              departed, but Mlle. de Montgolfier resolutely stayed on in her flat, with
                              her maid and a young lad for the outdoor service, doubly necessary during
                              the siege, when every pound of food had to be obtained by standing in the
                              
                              <foreign id="d45862e3187" xml:lang="fre">queue</foreign>, and she merely filled a huge

                              bombs.” This old Frenchwoman of eighty spent her days for four months of
                              that bitter winter attending an ambulance ever full of wounded soldiers
                              brought in from the sorties, and when the siege was over it was found that
                              Mademoiselle had torn up all her sheets and table‐cloths for dressings, and
                              had then taken her own delicate stock of body‐linen, so that her maid said
                              tearfully, “

                              If it were at first artificial in the original conception of the Versailles
                              of the seventeenth century, it had become entirely natural to French people
                              of social rank after its adoption by three or four succeeding generations.
                              Educated by a mother who had been young under Louis the Fifteenth, and who
                              had occupied in the Ardêche a great provincial position—brought to Paris
                              when still a child, and accustomed to the conversation and the manners of
                              the choicest cosmopolitan world as the inheritrix of a scientific name—Mlle.
                              de Montgolfier blended in her own person all the best elements of French
                              breeding. The Fairy Godmother had allotted her every gift except that of
                              beauty, and she seems to have early made up her mind not to marry, though
                              suitors were not wanting. The chief interest of a most affectionate heart
                              was her enduring friendship of sixty years with Mme. Swanton‐Belloc, whose
                              noble portrait in the Louvre enables this generation to understand the
                              devotion she inspired. To this lady’s children, and particularly to the only
                              son, Mlle. de Montgolfier was a second mother. To the<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="301" data-tei-n="295"> </a></span> youngest generation she became in her old age the
                              dear “Maman Aide” they will never forget; a gracious figure of the France
                              which has passed away.

                           amid the whistles of the luggage trains on that Great Northern line, sees before
                           him a very wide street, sloping uphill, to the not unpicturesque town. On the

                           an old abbey now used as a spinning factory. On the broad pavement are pots and

                           stands a female figure; her head is ornamented with a diadem of battlements, and
                           her right hand rests upon a spinning‐wheel; she symbolizes the good town of St.
                           Quintin, the town of spinners; but on either side of her are bas‐reliefs of a
                           battlefield commanded by an elderly general in spectacles, and at her back,
                           facing the upper street, is sculptured the haughty inspired head of the “Fou

                           no longer, and a general effort was ordered to be made of troops fighting all
                           round about, so that the sortie which we now call the Battle of Buzenval, the
                           last sortie from Paris, which took place on the 21st of January, might have a
                           chance of success. And it nearly did have it, for the French were uppermost on

                           a “Prix de Rome,” and all his early works announced a future of unsurpassed
                           success. In that same famous fatal sortie marched a more elderly professor. He
                           was then past forty, the father of many boys, and the very last human being with
                           whom could be associated ideas of bloodshed; from him, as he sits in his velvet
                           cap, may be heard the story of what happened at Buzenval.

                           with spiked helmets got out of the carriages and formed. It seemed to the St.

                           General Faidherbe was beaten back, and the town of St. Quintin was given over to

                        <p id="d45862e3298">French biographical history supplies us with a companion picture to that of Lady
                           Rachel, and accident placed in my hands the story and the letters, which latter
                           are absolutely unknown in England. The Maréchale‐Duchesse de Montmorency, whose
                           real character can with patience be unearthed from the solemn diction of her
                           biographer, and the strange old French of her own letters (a French anterior to
                           that of Corneille and Racine, and not much later than that of the essays of
                           Montaigne), is a figure well worth preserving. The original biography appears to
                           have been published in 1684, sixteen years after her death, and was reprinted in
                           Belgium at the beginning of this century, in 1824. It is probably impossible to
                           find except on some old bookstall, and the antiquity of the story it relates may
                           be imaginatively gauged by the fact that its heroine was a devoted friend of
                           Madame de Sevigné’s grandmother. She is wrapt round in the printed pages by what
                           may be figuratively termed the folds of a Veil of Devotion, under which it
                           becomes a little difficult to realize the figure<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="310" data-tei-n="304"> </a></span> of the adoring wife of Henri de Montmorency. Nevertheless we will try and
                           discover what the poor young woman was really like, before age and bitter
                           suffering had changed and chastened her almost beyond recognition.

                        <p id="d45862e3303">Maria Felicia des Ursins was an Italian Princess, and the niece of Pope Sixtus
                           the Fifth; she was born in Rome in the year 1600, when Elizabeth was ruling
                           England in her old age, and the prosperous Shakespeare was adored by the
                           play‐going people of London. Marie de Medicis had lately left Florence for
                           Paris, to be the second wife of Henri the Fourth; the series of huge pictures
                           constituting Rubens’ historic rhapsody, and now on the walls of the Louvre, show
                           us the veritable form and face of one at least of the principal personages in
                           the following story; the Royal Godmother; the Duchesse de Bracciano, mother of
                           Felicia, was the cousin and intimate friend of Marie de Medicis, and would have
                           accompanied the bride to Paris but for the expected birth of this youngest
                           child. When the little girl was born, the Queen was godmother by proxy, the
                           baptism took place at St. Peter’s, and the baby was, alas! destined to the
                           grandeur<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="311" data-tei-n="305"> </a></span> which beseemed the cousin of
                           royalty. When she was four years of age she was given up to the Grand Duchess of
                           Tuscany, to be brought up under that lady’s care; her own mother, the Duchess of
                           Bracciano, died three years later. Of her childhood we have a few scanty
                           details—how she once told a lie about some apricots, and was greatly repentant,
                           and how she nearly lost her life from an attack of small‐pox; the remedies
                           inflicted by the Florentine doctors were truly horrible, nevertheless Felicia
                           survived them, and at thirteen a marriage was arranged for her by the Queen of
                           France, who betrothed her to Henri, Duc de Montmorency; he was five years older
                           than herself, and the most accomplished of all the young French nobles. He was
                           son and grandson to the two famous Constables de Montmorency, and had indeed
                           been destined by his father for another bride, but the Queen had her own way;
                           she sent the Marquis de Traynel to Florence with his wife to fetch Felicia, and
                           the young Princess was married by proxy.

                        <p id="d45862e3308">As soon as the ceremony was over, her father, the Duc de Bracciano, left secretly
                           for Rome,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="312" data-tei-n="306"> </a></span> without bidding the poor little soul
                           good‐bye. He wished to spare her the pangs of a farewell of which he knew the
                           probable duration. Of all his many children, Felicia most resembled himself. But
                           her brothers and her eldest married sister remained with her, and also the
                           Princess Orsina, who seems to have been a trifle older than herself.

                        <p id="d45862e3314">With the festivities mingled doubtless many tears, but they were cut short by the
                           arrival of the French ships at Leghorn; and the young Duchess left her native
                           Italy for ever, and, with a suitable train of attendants, set sail for
                           Marseilles, where we learn that she visited several famous churches, and in
                           particular the neighbouring grotto in which Mary Magdalene is said to have dwelt
                           for many years in penitence. At Avignon she was met by her father‐in‐law, the
                           old Constable de Montmorency, who received her most tenderly, but regretted to
                           find her such a child. He left her on the borders of Dauphiné, to prepare the
                           proper cortège for his son, and Felicia journeyed north, along the roads we know
                           so well, though we now rush past them with lightning speed; and she finally
                           reached Paris some days<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="313" data-tei-n="307"> </a></span> before the young Duke.
                           Marie de Medicis received her at the New Louvre, in that Pavilion du Roi which
                           had been completed under Henri the Fourth. These noble rooms, long closed, are
                           now shown to the public. The rest of the New Louvre is due to successive reigns.
                           On the day when the young Duke was expected, Felicia took her station at one of
                           the windows (doubtless the great window with the balcony upon the quay which
                           looks across the Seine to Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle), and by her side
                           was the Boy‐King Louis the Thirteenth, just a year younger than herself. Felicia
                           this day was full of “extraordinary gaiety.” It is the only time we catch the
                           glimpse of a smile enlivening her serious and passionate nature. Presently
                           appeared the procession from Languedoc; a hundred of the best gentlemen of the
                           province riding in splendid coaches, accompanying the extremely handsome young
                           bridegroom, who was not quite twenty years of age; the bride being now in her
                           fifteenth year. She was presented to him by the King, who said, “Here is my
                           cousin. Behold the illustrious Italian. Is she not worthy of you? Are you not
                           satisfied with her?” The<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="314" data-tei-n="308"> </a></span> Queen‐mother also
                           made a pretty speech, and the Duc de Montmorency, godson to the late King (the
                           Grand Henri), replied suitably, as did the old Constable, his father. The young
                           couple were solemnly and suitably married at the Louvre, and the King paid all
                           the expenses of the splendid fête, Felicia being so nearly related to his
                           mother.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e3321">And now began the singular romance which the old‐fashioned writer of this
                           biography, evidently a priest of the seventeenth century, finds it difficult to
                           tell in suitably, edifying words, although it is also whimsically evident that
                           his human heart profoundly sympathized with the story he had to tell. Felicia,
                           an exile from her family and her native land, and possessed of a soul naturally
                           yearning towards unusual heights of religious devotion, received Henri de
                           Montmorency as a special gift from heaven, and concentrated upon him all the
                           passionate fervour of her nature. The Bishop of St. Pons, who had known her well
                           at the Court, said of her many years after, that anyone, considering her
                           character as it appeared to those among whom she lived, would never have
                           supposed it possible that she could give her love to any man, had not<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="315" data-tei-n="309"> </a></span> the evident object of her affection been actually
                           visible in the person of her husband, She seemed to him, and to others,
                           predestined to a life of prayer and good works, had not Henri de Montmorency
                           intervened. It is a little difficult to translate the good bishop’s thought
                           fully into common English, but it probably contained more than a kernel of
                           truth. No children blessed the union, and she prayed incessantly for the heir
                           that did not come, her husband consoling her by saying that if he had had a boy,
                           he must have taken much more pains to save his money. Montmorency from the first
                           regarded her with the highest esteem and admiration, but for some years he did
                           not give her unmixed satisfaction. Her biographer treats this delicate subject
                           with great reserve, saying that “he always loved her, but did not always love
                           her only,” and that nevertheless his distractions were only “reprehensible
                           amusements.” Felicia, under these troubled circumstances, showed unusual sense
                           and courage for so young a wife. However much she was tormented by a natural
                           jealousy, she exercised complete exterior self‐control, and at last literally
                           conquered by prayer “this dear<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="316" data-tei-n="310"> </a></span> husband
                           (
                           <foreign id="d45862e3327" xml:lang="fre">époux</foreign>), whom alone she loved, and whose
                           entire affection she herself desired.” And when at last Montmorency finally
                           repented of his evil doings, he seasoned his repentance with a mild jest,
                           saying, “My heart! if you cannot forget the past, think when you remember it,
                           that if I had been better you would have shown less piety, for how many of your
                           prayers would have then been left unsaid!” But he told everybody, especially the
                           Court, that he owed his conversion to his wife, and that then, and in the
                           future, she was the only woman for him.

                        <p id="d45862e3331">It is impossible to understand the old French biographies without recognizing the
                           double current of human passion and intense spiritual devotion. It meets the
                           reader at every turn—sin and conviction of sin; failure and redress; the woman
                           who leads “a youth of pleasure” not ending by “an old age of cards,” but on her
                           knees in some convent; the man turning right round, and changing his ways in
                           obedience to a call. French history is full of it. In Felicia’s young days we
                           are told that she managed to lead a quiet life in Paris, even in the midst of
                           “tumult and agitations.” Henri was there—“she saw him,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="317" data-tei-n="311"> </a></span> she possessed him, she was happy.” When he was
                           obliged to go to Languedoc to his government, she returned to Chantilly, “that
                           she might think more freely about him and pray for his preservation.” When he
                           was seized with a contagious fever, she rushed down to Languedoc to nurse him,
                           and here she had what she considered a distinct answer to prayer. One night,
                           when he seemed to be sinking from hour to hour, the Duchess went into a cabinet
                           adjacent to his room, and falling on her knees, cried, “My God! my God! wilt
                           thou take him from me?” and hardly had the words left her lips, than an unknown
                           voice replied very distinctly, “No, not now” (

                           prevent her re‐entering the room. He believed the Duke to be at the very moment
                           of death, and he held out the will, probably as a sign that all was over. She
                           brushed past the Marquis, saying that her husband would not die. She hushed the
                           prayers for the dying which were being recited round his bed, and in an hour the
                           Duke awoke as if from a profound sleep.

                           the way in which Felicia dealt with the immense complicated household of the
                           great Seigneur. How she kept the gentlemen in check and ruled the gentlewomen,
                           and did constant acts of charity; and how from the age of nineteen her health
                           became very delicate, and how she never allowed scandal to be talked in her
                           presence, and how the young King said he wished all the young Court ladies were
                           as modest as Mme. de Montmorency. The portrait is stippled in with many
                           words.

                           youthful Court; the Duchess, whose age marched with the century, was just
                           nine‐and‐twenty, the King was eight‐and‐twenty, and her husband thirty‐four.

                        <p id="d45862e3365">A small war was now got up by the French king against Piedmont and Savoy, in
                           which Montmorency is said to have covered himself with glory by his feats in the
                           field; and Louis, who had accompanied his army, wrote to the Queen‐mother that
                           Montmorency had not only won a battle, but had wounded the Italian Prince Doria,
                           making him prisoner, and had also taken nineteen flags. All this so terrified
                           Felicia, that she persuaded the King to recall her husband from the war, and the
                           latter promised her that he would so organize the government of Languedoc as to
                           live more in Paris, and also at Chantilly, where he now began to spend great
                           sums of money over that splendid château which was eventually destroyed at the
                           French Revolution, and which in our own days was rebuilt by the Duc d’Aumale.
                           But vain were all these projects, evil days were coming on the Montmorencys,
                           concerning which I find in the old<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="320" data-tei-n="314"> </a></span> book a most
                           extraordinary prophecy, which at the time was kept carefully from the Duchess by
                           all concerned.

                        <p id="d45862e3370">The Duke, passing through Avignon with Marshal de Schomberg, was told of a holy
                           monk who when at his prayers was seen to be elevated above the ground. There is
                           a well‐known picture in the Louvre of a similar occurrence, in which the monk is
                           represented as peeling carrots in the convent kitchen while engaged meanwhile in
                           interior prayer. The two nobles went to the convent at Avignon, saw the monk
                           hovering in the air, and tried to kiss his feet. Marshal de Schomberg was
                           allowed to perform the act of homage, but when Montmorency approached, the feet
                           were withdrawn from his lips, at which he was greatly alarmed, supposing that
                           the hindrance could only be accounted for by some forgotten sin on his own part.
                           But on being interrogated by the superior of the convent, the monk replied that
                           he could not allow his feet to be kissed by “a man predestined so soon to enter
                           into the glory of the saints.” The reply was carefully kept secret from the
                           subject of the prophecy, and remained untold until after his death.

                        <p id="d45862e3375">This journey to the South of France was the last undertaken by the hapless man;
                           his wife had insisted on accompanying him, but when she reached Beziers, a town
                           not far from Montpellier, she fell violently ill with acute rheumatism, which
                           was attributed to her having, when lately in Lyons, spent her nights at her
                           window, watching for the couriers, during the anxieties of the Italian War. And
                           what was worse and more alarming was the intelligence that Gaston of Orleans,
                           the King’s rebellious brother, had returned to France from the Spanish
                           Netherlands. The quarrel was a complicated one; Marie de Medicis sided with her
                           younger son, and Richelieu with the King; Richelieu’s chief object being to
                           lower the influence of the great feudal nobles; and, as is well known, he
                           succeeded in giving to the monarchy that fatal supremacy which long afterwards
                           was one great source of the Revolution. It was sorely against his wife’s wish
                           that Montmorency took the side of Gaston, and it is difficult to understand how
                           he can have so utterly miscalculated. Ill as she was, she put forth her whole
                           strength to induce him to change his mind, but in vain. One night he pacified<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="322" data-tei-n="316"> </a></span> her by going to bed in an adjoining room,
                           after wishing her a tender good‐night, but he presently got up softly and
                           secretly, and went off to meet the conspirators. On another occasion after he
                           had so deceived her, she insisted on leaving her sick‐bed three times, and had
                           herself carried into his room. to see if he were safe, and each time she found
                           him there; his hour had not yet come; and the third time she besought him in the
                           tenderest way to give up his designs, which she assured him “he could not carry
                           out without causing her death of grief.” He wept and caressed and cajoled her,
                           but she saw through him only too well. No other human being was now anything to
                           him but his wife Felicia, yet not even for her would he renounce his ambition.
                           On the 24th of August, 1632, he came for the last time and sat by her bedside;
                           he told her he hoped finally to reconcile Gaston with the King, talked of things
                           he meant to do on his return, and told her that he felt sure of success. The
                           poor woman could do nothing and could say no more; she could only weep upon her
                           pillow, and when Henri had at last got out of the room he was so agonized
                           that<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="323" data-tei-n="317"> </a></span> he fainted away. He was afterwards
                           heard praying amidst his sobs—praying for his wife’s temporal welfare and for
                           the safety of his own soul, “que mon salut eternel ne perisse point avec ma
                           vie.” And he was gone.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e3383">The end came very quickly. In one of the first engagements with the troops of the
                           King, Montmorency received eighteen wounds and was taken prisoner. It may be
                           thought it would have been happier for him if he had died on the field of
                           battle, and assuredly to Felicia it would have been a far lesser shock; but the
                           intervening weeks gave him the opportunity of making a singularly pious and
                           resigned end. When the 
                           <foreign id="d45862e3385" xml:lang="fre">écuyer</foreign> sent by his
                           unhappy wife came to his bedside, the surgeons were dressing his wounds, and
                           Montmorency said, “Tell your mistress how numerous and how severe are the wounds
                           you have beheld, and assure her that which I have caused to her heart is the
                           cruellest of all to me.” And he wrote this letter with his own hands:—

                        <p id="d45862e3408">The next page contains a curious and pathetic record of how the poor Duchess was
                           tossed backwards and forwards in the throes of a heart and conscience almost too
                           delicate for this world’s work. She refused to attempt to corrupt the guards,
                           and she gives a strange hint of wishing to fly into Italy and let it be thought
                           she was dead; she seems to have imagined that if Montmorency was supposed to be
                           a widower his life might be saved by a royal alliance, but she knew that this
                           would be a sinful thing to do. Somebody suggested recourse to witchcraft, and
                           the possible help of the devil, but to this also Felicia turned a deaf ear; she
                           would not risk her husband’s soul for his temporal safety. At last his friends
                           determined to try and save him without letting the Duchess know their ways and
                           means; they were foiled, because he was so weakened by the loss of blood as to
                           be constantly fainting away, and it was impossible<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="325" data-tei-n="319"> </a></span> to make any plans involving personal exertion on the
                           part of the prisoner. All this is very obscurely told, for when the biography
                           was originally put together only fifty‐two years had elapsed since the
                           catastrophe, and it is probable that some of the people concerned were still
                           alive. In the meantime the different members of the royal family, and many of
                           the great nobility, tried hard to save Montmorency, and the wretched Gaston, who
                           had been the tempter and caused all the misery, implored the clemency of the
                           King, but in vain. Louis the Thirteenth, inspired by Richelieu, left the Duke to
                           be tried by the parliament of Languedoc, “according to the laws of the State,”
                           which meant death. The prisoner pleaded guilty, was at once condemned, and
                           turned every thought of his heart to the ordinances of his religion. He died
                           with perfect courage and resignation, at the age of thirty‐seven; supremely dear
                           to one poor woman’s heart, dear to his sister the Princess de Condé, dear to
                           France, which regarded him as a national hero, and regretted by the whole of
                           Europe in an age when Europe was more vitally united than she is now. This is
                           his last letter to his wife:—

                           trust will soon be in heaven, to accept this affliction from the gentle hand of
                           our Saviour. I have received such graces from His goodness that you can feel
                           that you have every subject of consolation. Adieu once again, my dear heart.

                        <p id="d45862e3419">The intelligence that the execution had taken place was brought to Felicia by two
                           Capuchin fathers, who were reluctantly persuaded to precede the government
                           commissioners. They entered her room in profound silence and found her sitting
                           in a passion of tears; but no sooner did she see them than she suddenly became
                           quiet, saying afterwards that she felt as if Almighty God had seized her in a
                           firm grasp, “and as one whom another was tightly holding to avoid any
                           possibility of motion,” and she then and there made three resolutions, firstly
                           to embrace the religious life as soon as she was free to do so, secondly to
                           follow strictly step by step whatever appeared to be the will of God,<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="327" data-tei-n="321"> </a></span> thirdly to make a sacrifice of every feeling of
                           resentment; and when, as she interiorly uttered this last promise, the
                           remembrance of a gesture of her fatal enemy Cardinal Richelieu rushed into her
                           mind, she heard a voice saying imperiously, “

                        <p id="d45862e3427">Madame de Montmorency survived her husband for thirty‐four years, but though she
                           was nearly sixty before she was able to carry out her desire of taking the veil,
                           her life was so associated with the order of the Visitation that it is difficult
                           to describe it in a manner interesting to the general reader. She was for some
                           time kept in a kind of royal imprisonment in the Château of Moulins, where her
                           brother the Père des Ursins, a bare‐footed Carmelite, came to visit her, and
                           when at last she was set free by the King’s decree, she made up her mind not to
                           leave that town. Her brother stayed with her for two months, and was to her an
                           immense consolation; with his approval she acquired a large house next door to
                           the Convent of Saint Marie de Moulins and obtained permission to open a door of
                           communication. Here she kept up a large household of retainers suitable to her
                           rank, and<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="328" data-tei-n="322"> </a></span> though she lived personally
                           according to a strict religious rule, she was obliged to keep up much
                           intercourse with the outer world. Anne of Austria wrote her a very affectionate
                           letter, and Gaston wrote her another which cost her many bitter tears. He told
                           her he was coming to see her, and she consented to receive him. In this she
                           strictly obeyed her husband’s dying injunctions to pardon the direct and

                        <p id="d45862e3432">Ten years after her husband’s death, Louis the Thirteenth passed through Moulins,
                           and Madame de Montmorency, who was in church with the nuns, heard the drums and
                           trumpets which announced the arrival of the King, and wept at the sound, but had
                           the self‐command to continue quietly saying her prayers. Both the King and
                           Richelieu sent a messenger to the woman whose earthly happiness they had ruined.
                           She spoke to both of these, saying to the first, “Sir, I beg of you to tell the
                           King that I have been much surprised that his Majesty yet remembers such an
                           unhappy creature, and one so unworthy of the honour.” And to the second
                           messenger she said, “Sir, you will say if you please to your master that my
                           tears speak for me, and that I<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="329" data-tei-n="323"> </a></span> am his very
                           humble servant,” but neither the King nor Richelieu dared to present themselves
                           before her. And when on the 4th of the December of that same year she received
                           the news of the death of Richelieu, she opened the letter and read it in perfect
                           silence. She then folded up the letter, telling none but the Superior of the
                           news which it contained, and as soon as the hour of recreation was ended and she
                           had returned to her own rooms, she made up several rolls of money, which she
                           sent round to the different churches of the town and ordered Masses to be said
                           for the repose of her enemy’s soul.

                        <p id="d45862e3437">Madame de Montmorency caused a wonderfully beautiful tomb to be erected over her
                           husband many years after his death; and she obtained permission to have his
                           coffin brought from the South of France to Moulins. It was opened in the
                           presence of officers sent by her, who found his body embalmed and in the same
                           state as when first he was laid in the grave. It was borne through France in a
                           chariot covered with a great pall of black velvet, and drawn by eight horses in
                           funeral trappings. The Queen had written to the Duchess to beg her that this
                           should<span class="-teibp-pb"><a class="-teibp-pageNum" data-tapas-n="330" data-tei-n="324"> </a></span> be done very quietly, and the
                           cortège avoided passing through any of the great towns of Languedoc; but in
                           Limousin, one of his old friends, M. Soudheilles, seeing it approach near to one
                           of his estates, called together the nobility of the neighbouring country, who
                           went out in a procession to meet it. It was brought into Moulins at night and
                           the coffin laid where the splendid monument can be seen to this day.<a href="#belloc-walled06" class="ref-note">¹</a></p>
                        
                        <p id="d45862e3444">Madame de Montmorency was a seer of visions, and quite convinced that her Henri
                           appeared to her three separate times, to her immense consolation. At one moment
                           she made the sacrifice of all the letters he had ever written to her except
                           those dated from prison. She wished to forget the too poignant sense of loss.
                           She was an old woman of sixty‐six when she was called to rejoin him in perfect
                           faith. I trust that the story of her life‐long grief, and the way in which she
                           bore it, may not be without some interest to the modern world.
